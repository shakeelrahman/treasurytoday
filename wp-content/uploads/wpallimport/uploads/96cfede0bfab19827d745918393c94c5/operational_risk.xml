<h4 id="preparing-for-the-unknown-unknowns">Preparing for the unknown unknowns</h4>
<p>Sandip Patil, Head of Financial Institutions and Liquidity Management Services, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Asia Pacific at Citi spoke about the current geopolitical risk landscape, and what that means for corporates. He noted that several variables dominate this theme, including trade and the evolution of trade treaties; the dominance of China across the ecosystem; changing consumption patterns; shifting business models, and evolving regulations. As well as managing their trade partners, supply chains and customer behaviours, Patil said that companies need to deploy cutting-edge technologies in their businesses, “so that they can generate a very differentiated client experience, which is a recipe for success in realising growth in Asia.”</p>
<p>When it comes to navigating these changes, Patil said there are a number of “known unknowns” to consider, including managing trade counterparties, locations, business model shifts and the challenges that come around managing liquidity and working capital. But for companies operating in emerging markets, “there are also a lot of unknown unknowns – and that requires pretty accurate planning.”</p>
<p>In order to manage these challenges, Patil suggested, “Try to visualise the future for your industry, for your customers, for your ecosystem, for the geographies that you operate in. Plan for the future, and then start work on executing that plan. And measure consistently, so that you are dominating each and every parameter as a best-in-class in the industry.” He added that Citi offers advisory practices across each industry, helping clients understand their current position and the key initiatives they need to invest in.</p>
<h4 id="geopolitical-tensions-and-the-impact-on-trade">Geopolitical tensions and the impact on trade</h4>
<p>Kanika Thakur, Head of Trade, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Asia Pacific Citi, spoke about the impact of geopolitics on trade. She explained that most of the clients Citi works with operate across multiple countries – meaning that they may be impacted by potential geopolitical tensions not only in manufacturing locations, but also in countries where goods are consumed, or suppliers are located. As such, “Clients are watching very closely how different geographies are interacting with each other.”</p>
<p>In 2022, with uncertainty around the pandemic continuing and supply chains becoming more complicated, she said “you will see inventory positions being taken; you will see domestic manufacturing decisions being taken; you will see transportation implications coming through.” As such, she predicted that people will continue to have backup plans, build resiliency and ensure there are no distractions to their businesses.</p>
<p>For corporates, she said, it is important to have continual engagement with on-the-ground resources in relevant markets, and to achieve diversification across supply chain partners, manufacturing inputs and shipping inputs. “I think putting all your eggs in one basket is potentially difficult at this point in time,” she added. But she also noted the importance of being able to rely on key trusted partners, as well as having robust contingency plans in place.</p>
<h4 id="seeking-resilience">Seeking resilience</h4>
<p>Philip Summerton, CEO of Cambridge Econometrics, explained the company’s role includes providing data-driven analysis to policymakers at all levels, as well as providing economic research to help corporations navigate today’s world.</p>
<p>“For me, they really need to start thinking about how to make their businesses resilient, rather than profitable,” he said. “In turn, that probably leads to long-term profitability anyway.” He added that with the current uncertainty around the global economy, it is more difficult to carry out traditional business planning, and to make traditional finance decisions based on ROI and profitability. “Instead, you’re having to think about how to protect your business model cost-effectively.”</p>
<p>When risks are systemic, he said, “you have to think about your business in a different way to protect it, and that is really about scenario planning.” This means looking at a possible event and considering the impact on the business, its supply chain and its customers: “It actually takes imagination, and some real thinking about what the future could look like. A lot of businesses need to change their way of thinking, and really focus on resilience under uncertainty.”</p>
<h4 id="from-covid-to-climate-change">From Covid to climate change</h4>
<p>Finally, where specific risks are concerned, Summerton said that Covid, inflation and climate change are things to watch out for in 2022 – “The first two are really for 2022, and climate change is just every year from now until forever.”</p>
<p>He added, “I think at some point this decade we’re due a really big climate shock – whether that’s this year or next year; whether it plays out as a series of more intense and more frequent disasters, or whether it’s one really big disaster.” If a climate shock were to occur, he predicted, the policy response will become stronger and quicker, driving rapid changes in technology – “so there could be some very big, fast changes that really affect people.”</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Former US president Ronald Reagan may have been exaggerating somewhat when he described inflation as being ‘as violent as a mugger, as frightening as an armed robber and as deadly as a hit man’, but there is no denying that its rapid rise over the last 12 months has been a worrying trend for many.</p>
<p>In January, UK price rises reached their highest level since just before sterling fell out of the European exchange rate mechanism in 1992, and eurozone inflation has never been higher. On the other side of the Atlantic you would have to go back to 1982 find the last time consumer prices showed a similar annual increase.</p>
<p>Some of the factors behind these increases will be familiar to seasoned inflation-watchers – the 1970s was a decade of energy crises, for example, while price rises are a common consequence of economic recovery as demand picks up. The difference this time, of course, is that the world is still grappling with the fall-out from an unprecedented pandemic.</p>
<p>However, there are still many steps corporates can take to mitigate the impact of inflation on their business, according to Richard Blokland, corporate treasurer at NewCold Advanced Cold Logistics in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>“These include provisions in customers’ contracts to ‘call’ price increases during a contract year when inflation for a relevant cost driver hits a certain level,” he explains. “Furthermore, businesses could differentiate the purchase of relevant cost drivers in terms of suppliers and/or contract tenors.”</p>
<p>With around two-thirds of its costs relating to personnel expenses, SAP has increased its investment in talent retention while to protect its product margins the company has inflation adjustments defined in its support and cloud contracts.</p>
<p>Treasury teams should include inflation scenarios in forecasts for funding and risk management and consider lengthening procurement and maybe duration of debt, suggests David Blair, Managing Director of Acarate Consulting.</p>
<p>“Other strategies for mitigating the impact of inflation include segmenting cash on hand into operating versus investment and exploring offsetting bank fees with earnings credit,” says Henrik Lang, head of global liquidity in global transaction services at Bank of America.</p>
<p>Corporates looking to quantify the inflation exposure of their business and the respective risks must first understand the type of inflation exposure the business is facing, whether there is enough pricing power to pass on potential price increases, and how earnings are developing compared to costs, adds Ole Matthiessen, Global Head of Cash Management at Deutsche Bank.</p>
<p>Simon Geal, Executive Vice President of procurement and supply chain consultancy Proxima identifies three possible approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Collaborating internally to identify where impact can be mitigated through simplification, substitution, cost engineering, or price uplifts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working differently with suppliers and where appropriate creating partnerships, instilling innovation and ultimately securing supply which could also come from opening new sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cutting out overspend in terms of pricing or volume.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Dino Nicolaides, Head of Treasury advisory UK &amp; Ireland at Redbridge, recommends that corporates assess the effectiveness of their hedging policies in the context of higher inflation and potentially higher interest rates.</p>
<p>“From a cash risk management perspective treasurers also need to identify any cash that is trapped across their organisation so that they can utilise it effectively,” he says. “In a low interest rate environment where corporates can borrow relatively cheaply this might not be a priority, but if central banks raise interest rates sharply to combat inflation the cost of this idle cash will increase.”</p>
<p>Options for corporates that find themselves in this position include implementing automatic cash pooling arrangements and reviewing intra-group lending processes.</p>
<p>Ghulam Alahi is practice principal at professional services firm Vision Consulting and managing director of firms in the real estate and retail communications sectors. He says treasury teams also need to take account of competitors’ responses to rising inflation and determine whether price inflation experienced by the business is a supply issue that could reverse when supply chain pressures ease.</p>
<p>With a number of central banks either already raising interest rates to bring down inflation or likely to do so in the coming months, Alahi says some corporates could be faced with the double whammy of immediate and ongoing cost increases at the same time as the pressure of interest rate rises on their business and customer base.</p>
<p>“This may create opportunities for companies with surplus cash,” he says. “However, for a company that funds its working capital through borrowings there will be various aspects to consider such as where it is in the borrowing cycle in terms of the review point, whether the existing borrowing is on fixed or variable terms, and whether the borrowing is subject to any covenants that may be breached.”</p>
<p>Nicolaides acknowledges that there is no easy answer to the question of whether higher interest rates are more or less of a concern than high inflation.</p>
<p>“High inflation erodes consumer purchasing power, which can lead to a slowdown in the wider economy that tends to affect companies operating in non-essential goods and services such as the luxury goods market disproportionately,” he says. “High inflation also increases the price of raw materials. When inflation rises, the value of cash is eroded and corporates may need more cash for their day-to-day operations so corporates need to review the extent to which their pricing strategy can compensate for this.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, higher interest rates as a mechanism for maintaining inflation at an acceptable level (2% in the case of the Bank of England), can impact investment decisions as debt becomes more expensive, increasing the required return on investments.</p>
<p>“Higher interest rates are more of an issue as they will have an impact on bank covenants,” agrees Blokland. “But if a business has put in place an interest rate hedging programme which was tested and found to be sustainable, it probably won’t be an issue.”</p>
<p>SAP makes the point that we are still in a historically low interest rate environment and that negative interest rates on investments in the eurozone have a significant negative impact of business despite the financing benefits.</p>
<p>Lang observes that in either scenario – higher interest rates or high inflation – the net economic benefit or cost to companies depends on what balance sheet positions and business models they have employed.</p>
<p>“For instance, companies that have more short-term liquidity compared to floating rate liabilities may benefit from higher rates,” he says. “Consider how some companies locked in longer-term funding (for example, bonds) when rates were low – they stand to benefit from higher rates. In a high inflationary environment, companies with more pricing power will likely benefit since they are able to pass through to their consumers the higher charges they receive from their suppliers.”</p>
<p>It is also important to note that the toolset for mitigating interest rate risk is far more advanced than that for inflation. “Highly liquid swap markets, financing structures and other solutions should allow treasuries to fully manage interest rate risk,” suggests Matthiessen. “As inflation risk sometimes cannot be mitigated, it could make sense to increase the focus on risks which can be hedged more easily.”</p>
<p>As for the extent to which businesses have been affected by greenflation or inflation resulting from the transition to a green economy, Nicolaides observes that the corporates he speaks to generally view this as a short-term phenomenon that will have a long-term positive impact on their business.</p>
<p>“The transition to a more sustainable business model can require significant investment for companies in the short term,” observes Lang. “However, over the past few years it has become clear that investors and lenders value companies that prioritise ESG metrics (a phenomenon referred to as a ‘greenium’).”</p>
<p>This chimes with the view expressed by NatWest in recent a report on the post-pandemic economy, in which it states that while the transition towards a greener economy poses macro uncertainties and short-term inflationary pressures, the effects decrease significantly over the longer-term as a result of cheaper technologies.</p>
<p>Corporates which are proactively tackling these challenges have benefited from higher demand for their products or higher investor attraction, while those in need of green solutions have had to pay higher prices for goods and accept longer waiting times according to Matthiessen.</p>
<p>“In the light of high carbon prices, implementing innovative and clean technology becomes more important,” he adds. “Assuming carbon prices stay elevated, companies that rely on conventional technology for the future will face significant impact on their business model. The increase in prices has impacted all businesses and the recent increase cannot be solely attributed to the transformation to a green economy.”</p>
<p>It is also important to note that inflation and greenflation are not the same thing. It is possible for some companies to experience inflation as a ‘here today, gone tomorrow’ situation if the industry in which they operate is resilient and the supply chain re-establishes itself relatively quickly and smoothly. In contrast, the effect of transitioning to a green economy is continual costs.</p>
<p>“Uncontrollable political factors will affect the move towards a greener economy and determine whether the ‘green train’ accelerates, decelerates or simply stalls for a while,” suggests Alahi. “For the treasury professional, the costs of going green are likely to be ongoing and for public companies in particular there is greater attention being given to the green or not-so-green effects of the company’s operations with the need to comment and report these aspects.”</p>
<p>SAP accepts that the shift towards renewable energies as well as increasing CO2 prices and special taxes on fossil energies might lead to higher energy price levels on a mid- to long-term basis. However, it says it is working on various initiatives to increase energy efficiency as well as reduce CO2 emissions in its operations, such as carbon neutrality in its own operations by 2023 and a commitment to achieve net-zero along its value chain in line with a 1.5°c future in 2030.</p>
<p>“We are affected as energy is one of our most relevant cost drivers so we are acting on this development actively,” says Blokland. “Our business needs to make this transition in the end and there are a lot of opportunities to do so.”</p>
<p>The effects of change are being felt across many other aspects of the corporate world, adds Geal. “What we are seeing is a convergence of business strategies when it comes to procurement and supply chain,” he says. “This means that a lot of businesses are looking to do many of the same things at the same time, such as greenification, automation and digitisation.”</p>
<p>This is creating inflation in supply markets not just for products and services, but also for the strategy, transformation and change services that are needed to knit it all together. “Specifically in greenification we are seeing product and skills bottlenecks appearing which are pushing back lead times and pushing up prices,” he concludes.</p></div>

<p>As a ‘black swan’ event (although the jury is out on whether it can be defined as such) the COVID-19 pandemic posed significant risk management challenges for treasurers. Add to that an increased focus on climate change, the impact of Brexit on UK treasurers and even the Suez Canal obstruction in March, and treasurers and CFOs face a new risk landscape.</p>
<p>In the initial phases of the pandemic, treasury teams had to rapidly assess their firms’ overall liquidity positions and ensure they could access liquidity when they needed it. Keeping a company going, both operationally and financially, was a key concern. In addition, treasury teams had to transition to remote working environments.</p>
<p>This took place against a background of volatile financial markets and uncertainty about current and future revenues and cash flow. Many businesses focused on preserving cash, including retrenching staff or signing up to the various furlough schemes offered by governments and temporarily shutting down operations. They did this while seeking out potential lines of credit and other ways to maintain liquidity.</p>
<p>According to professional services firm Marsh McLennan, the adverse effects and uncertainty for businesses that arose from the pandemic will likely persist for some time, “with the worst possibly still to come”. This underscores how important cash preservation is for businesses, it says. “In addition to any actions they may have taken so far, businesses will likely need to explore other solutions, such as claims and collateral cost reduction strategies, credit insurance products, premium financing, and the use of captive insurers – all of which can help them stay liquid,” the firm says in an April 2020 briefing on liquidity.</p>
<p>Sarah Boyce, Associate Director – Policy and Technical at the Association of Corporate Treasurers, says liquidity risk and business continuity were “front and centre” for all treasurers at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Boyce says while new risks are not emerging, the focus given to certain risks has changed. “Treasurers are expanding their remit and rather than focusing on the biggest risks, they are looking at all risks, given the number of black swan events that have emerged,” she says. “Treasurers and CFOs realise it could be the least obvious corners of the organisation that could throw out the next challenge.”</p>
<p>This is a point also made by Damian Glendinning, Singapore-based Chairman of the Advisory Board at CompleXCountries, a global peer group network for senior corporate treasury professionals. “It is difficult to say what impact Covid has had on risk per se: what it has clearly done is to show that risks can emerge in ways none of us could easily envisage.”</p>
<p>Leonardo Orlando, an executive in Accenture’s Finance and Risk Practice, says the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on treasurers very much depends on the type of industry, the markets in which a company operates and its financial situation. “However, common to all treasurers was the fact that Covid was a unique, global event that affected all companies in all countries,” he says.</p>
<p>The initial reaction was generally one of minimisation – treasurers tried to reduce their risk exposure in order to prevent the situation worsening. After that, he says, corporate treasurers looked to put in place new scenario modelling to ensure they understood the problem and could capture similar events in different ways and understand the business impact.</p>
<p>Royston Da Costa, Assistant Group Treasurer at plumbing and heating products distributor Ferguson plc, has a similar view. He says while risk always has been a key treasury responsibility the assumptions had been based on “known risks”. The pandemic, he says, is “the first time the whole planet was affected by a crisis that did not just impact a few economies but also promoted the position of treasury technology to the forefront of a treasurer’s priorities”. Cash flow forecasting solutions have gained a boost from the pandemic as corporates recognise the importance of liquidity and forecasting of their cash positions.</p>
<p>Like Glendinning and Boyce, Da Costa says the emphasis on risk is changing, with the risk of cyber fraud gaining more importance as employees work from home and phishing and other attacks increase. The pandemic has caused banks to focus on shrinking the margins between assets and liabilities, with a stronger focus on off-balance sheet funding solutions, says Andreas Bohn, Partner at McKinsey &amp; Co in Frankfurt. “Corporate infrastructure and project financing is moving away from bank balance sheets and towards private equity funds and direct lending platforms. The impact for a treasurer is that they have more options and need to adapt.”</p>
<p>Another issue bubbling away for many corporate treasurers is climate change, and the wider environmental, social and governance (ESG) agenda, once referred to as corporate social responsibility. Under the Paris Agreement, a legally binding international treaty on climate change which came into force in November 2016, countries have committed to limit greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible to achieve a climate neutral world by 2050.</p>
<p>According to the United Nations, zero-carbon solutions are becoming competitive across economic sectors representing 25% of greenhouse gas emissions. The trend is most noticeable in the power and transport sectors and has created many new business opportunities for early movers. By 2030, zero-carbon solutions could be competitive in sectors representing over 70% of global emissions, says the UN.</p>
<p>“Whilst the Covid pandemic has had a profound impact on credit and liquidity risk, the bigger challenge will be incorporating decarbonisation into credit models and looking at the systematic risk this poses for some industries,” says Philip Freeborn, Group CIO, COO and Head of Pricing &amp; Risk at consultancy firm Delta Capita. “ESG reporting is not transparent enough and relies too much on self-reporting rather than on objective third-party assessment of companies and their supply chains.”</p>
<p>This is also an issue highlighted by Boyce. “Integrating ESG into treasury operations is an added complexity, mainly because there is a lack of consistent methodology about how activities will be treated by investors and ratings agencies,” she says. Consistent metrics and data are difficult to find and there is nervousness around claims of ‘greenwashing’ – misleading information about how environmentally sound a company’s products are. “For treasurers, the challenge is to pick the right banking partners. As greater clarity emerges around methodologies and disclosure requirements, there will be more activity in the green finance space,” she says.</p>
<p>A challenge for treasurers in ESG is the assumption that an organisation can instantly become green, adds Boyce. “That can’t happen and has to be an evolution. There are fears that some organisations in ‘brown’ industries may become unbanked or unattractive to banks. Transition to net zero carbon emissions is a big challenge for treasurers in those organisations.”</p>
<p>Moody’s Investor Services has reported soaring levels of green, social and sustainability bond issues. In Q121, sustainable bond volumes more than tripled year-on-year to reach a record total of US$231bn, a 19% increase over the previous quarter. Moody’s attributes the growth to a heightened level of government policy focus on climate change and sustainable development and strong, sustained interest among debt issuers and investors.</p>
<p>Glendinning notes that ESG issues have been growing in importance for companies, and therefore treasurers, for some time. “From a risk point of view, everyone is aware of the potentially significant impact on a company’s reputation of a highly publicised incident involving pollution, labour force abuses or corruption scandals,” he says. “However, treasurers in some industries, such as oil or tobacco, are finding some banks will refuse to work with them, and ESG-conscious investors are placing increasing demands as a condition for equity and bond funding.”</p>
<p>Many treasurers are complaining that this activism, while not a problem in itself, is causing issues due to the lack of generally accepted, clear, and consistent ESG measurement processes, adds Glendinning. “The concern is that one rating methodology may give a good score, while another gives a bad one.”</p>
<p>Da Costa does not believe treasurers have “fully embraced” ESG. While banks and fund managers appear to be advanced in providing an array of ESG products that corporates could use, he says he is uncertain as to whether corporates have kept pace with these developments.</p>
<p>Adrian Sargeant, CEO of advisory company ESG Treasury, says ESG will release more black swans into the market for which treasurers must be ready. “There is likely to be some fundamental change and whether you are a corporate or an individual that borrows money, you have to ask whether you are involved in a sector that has long-term prospects. Will a bank lend to a company in the oil sector, for example, to fund the cost of their transition to net zero?” he asks. Whole sectors, such as the energy sector, will have to transition to renewables.</p>
<p>Treasurers in some industries will face new challenges in regulatory risk as the response by governments to the pandemic demonstrated how quickly regulations can change. This is likely to happen with regard to climate change obligations as we move closer to the net zero emissions deadline of 2050, says Sargeant. “There could be a cliff edge moment where people who have been working on responses to climate change for decades have been doing too little, too late – the effort to fix things will be too great. This will affect a treasury’s ability to raise funding, with some loans coming off bank balance sheets in the future.”</p>
<p>One of the biggest changes in the risk landscape, says Boyce, is the increased engagement with business risks. “Supply chain risks are becoming a big thing. They make cash management more complex and the cash cycle may be longer as a consequence of the changes we are seeing due to the pandemic, Brexit and even the Suez tanker episode,” she says.</p>
<p>The Suez event, when the tanker Ever Given was grounded, was a good example of the fact that even during ‘normal’ times a relatively local event like a tanker being stuck in the Suez Canal can have global repercussions because of the nature of the globalised supply chain, says Boyce.</p>
<p>Technology is likely to play a greater role in risk management going forward. “Not surprisingly, more treasurers are investing in technology,” says Da Costa. Thorough reviews of processes and treasury infrastructures are also being undertaken.</p>
<p>Boyce says there is greater use of artificial intelligence and data analytics in treasury operations, but there is nothing particularly different about the risk framework, “it is still a matter of identifying, assessing, managing and reporting on risk. What has changed is how treasuries undertake these activities.”</p>
<p>Digitisation of the treasury was a disruptor before the pandemic, but has been accelerated since, says Accenture’s Orlando. “Some corporates have fast-tracked the onboarding of new technologies, analytics and techniques for risk management. These will enable the treasurer to better monitor liquidity on an end of day basis, and potentially in real time across the world.”</p>
<p>Glendinning is sceptical about treasury technology, observing that new products are constantly emerging, “but they are often old approaches wrapped up in new instruments. There is undoubted promise in technologies, such as artificial intelligence and data mining, to help identify new and emerging risks – but we are not yet seeing much practical adoption.”</p>
<p>Given the scale of the pandemic crisis, the fact that businesses continued to operate has reflected well on treasurers and their risk techniques, demonstrating they are good at what they do, says Boyce. “Treasuries are well-positioned to respond relatively smoothly to these events – they know what they have to do and get on with it.”</p>

<p><em>Operational risk is defined by the Basel Committee as: “The risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal process, people and systems, or from external events.” Once dismissed as the risks that didn’t fit in anywhere else, operational risk came into the public eye after events like the 9/11 attacks and the 2008 financial crisis, demonstrating that these risk areas not only matter, but are vastly under-catered for.</em></p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Deloitte’s 2017 report, ‘Operational risk management: The new differentiator’, stated that “in short, operational risk is the risk of doing business.” For treasurers, the failure to manage operational risk properly can have huge financial, regulatory and reputational ramifications.</p>
<p>According to the Global Risk Community, operational risk can be summarised as human risk, as it is the “risk of business operations failing due to human error.” As a result, businesses with a higher level of automation will theoretically have lower operational risk.</p>
<h4 id="too-much-technology">Too much technology?</h4>
<p>Mark Lewis, Bloomberg’s Head of Product Corporate Treasury, recognises the benefits of technology. However, he also believes that with more technology come more risks. For example, Lewis notes that treasury management systems (TMSs) are becoming increasingly sophisticated – and this isn’t necessarily a good thing for operational risk.</p>
<p>“Instead of just having a package solution, TMS vendors have ended up having this huge variety of choices,” Lewis says. “So instead of implementing a system in two and a half days, you implement in six months. Or, in some cases it’s a three-year implementation project when you get to the really big systems.” It’s this flexibility that Lewis believes creates opportunity for operational risk. “No one person knows every piece of it and what’s going on and whether it’s actually going to work properly or not,” he adds.</p>
<p>A simple example, he says, is running a report, applying a filter to it, and saving it. “Then you forget you put that filter on. So next time, you think you’re running the report for all your payments for sterling, but it’s filtered out a bunch and you don’t know. And if it’s not highlighted properly that the filter is on, you’ve missed something important that you should be doing.”</p>
<h4 id="hackers-abound">Hackers abound</h4>
<p>For Nor Adila Ismail, Chief Risk Officer at Petronas, the biggest operational risk in treasury is cyber-security, owing to the use of external systems such as SWIFT to process payments. “These external systems are in our treasury,” she explains. “For operational risk, we must learn from the Bangladesh Central Bank heist and consider the unauthorised access to certain payment systems.”</p>
<p>She continues: “Operational risk is always thought of as health, safety and environment, or security, but it’s never thought of as potential for theft or fraud. All of that needs to be looked at holistically so that we’re able to design the risk management accordingly, reflecting not only treasury but all the other aspects of our operations.”</p>
<p>Andreas Bohn, a partner at McKinsey, agrees that cyber-risk is one the most important factors in operational risk these days. He says this applies not only to internal areas such as data protection and/or manipulation of data sources, shadow accounts and cyber-fraud, but also to the risk of external cyber-attacks – such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and ransom demands – which can incapacitate a business for some time.</p>
<p>A 2016 report by Accenture and Chartis focused on “analysing the benefits of better alignment across operational risk management procedures with cyber-security.” The report argues that “cyber-attacks from external criminals or internally disgruntled employees” can fit the definition outlined by the Basel Committee, as they “become a problem only if the processes and people elements in an FI’s strategy are not sufficiently developed.” Additionally, the Basel Committee’s 2014 report on operational risk includes cyber-attacks as an example scenario. The report also points out the pressing need for firms to invest in cyber-security is only heightened by the regulators imposing retrospective fines and sanctions for past breaches.</p>
<p>Lewis agrees that cyber-security is more important than ever. With recent high-profile attacks on companies across the globe, he notes that having strong security around systems in place is imperative. “Having just a single password is insanity,” he says. “A user ID and password is just not good enough these days. We use biometrics and two-factor authentication.”</p>
<h4 id="human-error">Human error</h4>
<p>Operational risk can overlap with several other areas, says Bohn. For one, erroneous data entries, in particular when it comes to trade and payment entry – wrong signs, decimals, or currencies – can cause liquidity risks.</p>
<p>With human error often posing the biggest risk to any organisation, cyber-attacks coming from dangerous or phishing emails can fall under the operational risk umbrella. No amount of firewalls can protect against spam emails, and all it takes is one employee to unknowingly click on a link in an email for malware to infect the system.</p>
<p>However, human error doesn’t just mean clicking a malicious link. Instead, Lewis explains that the increased use of technology risks encourages basic errors like typing in the wrong account number. “I use the term ‘garbage in, garbage out’,” he says. “It’s so important that your starting point is putting the right data into a system, because once the data is in a system, people rely on it. And this is where things can easily go wrong from an operational risk perspective.” Bohn agrees, and notes that these erroneous data entries can cause operational risk to have overlaps with liquidity risks, particularly when it comes to trade and payment entry – for example, wrong signs, decimals or currencies.</p>
<p>As a result, Lewis says that having a four-eyes principle when capturing static data is a necessity. “People trust that the information in the system is correct and just press ‘send’ on payments because they’ve had a busy day,” he adds.</p>
<p>However, Lewis has seen high-tech solutions that flag changes on the transaction from the standard settlement instructions (SSIs) and automatically send those instructions to a second signatory for release of payment, highlighting the fact that it is not an SSI. Unfortunately, Lewis notes, this is often a costly feature and thus is often only affordable to larger corporations.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-the-risks">Mitigating the risks</h4>
<p>Manu Taneja, Executive, Cash Management &amp; Treasury Services, APAC, General Electric, believes that most of the treasuries he sees keep risks at a manageable level. “There’s a process to identify all the major risks and plug them,” he says, adding that the best way to do this is to have a strong operational risk framework in place.</p>
<p>The framework, according to Taneja, should be about finding the risk areas, building controls around them, offsetting the risks and then reviewing the cases that slip through the net. He believes there are three components: engaging the right stakeholders, building controls, and having a mechanism around them.</p>
<p>Bohn has a similar view, believing that a strong operational risk management has three lines of defence. “Appropriate policies, appropriate oversights, account validation and so on, is the first line – basically, the treasury itself,” he says. “The second line of defence looks at the control figures, defining the risk identification, the variations of the risks and setting limits and breakage points to get the key operational risks first of all under supervision, and then control. The third line of defence is the audit function, which then looks at the first and second lines to ensure they work properly.”</p>
<h4 id="putting-the-fire-out">Putting the fire out</h4>
<p>When operational risks arise and aren’t dealt with, there are usually procedures to follow. For Taneja, the first thing to do is “firefighting”. After that, it’s imperative to do a root cause analysis (RCA), plug the risk, figure out what happened, how it happened and how the right controls can be put in place moving forward. “Who did it is probably the last thing to be wondering and squabbling about,” he adds.</p>
<h4 id="who-should-be-involved">Who should be involved?</h4>
<p>In Ismail’s experience, when it comes to managing and mitigating operational risk in a treasury context, the best results come from a dedicated financial risk management and operational risk management team working hand-in-hand with the operations team in treasury. This allows all the teams to communicate and design something that’s workable for the treasury function of that specific company.</p>
<p>Taneja agrees that there should be cross-functional teams engaged throughout the process, as does the Accenture and Chartis report, which states “operation and cyber-security employees need lines of communication and a coordinated pre-planned response.”</p>
<p>The report continues, specifying that job titles such as chief information security, technology or information officer (CISO/CTO/CIO) “tend to have a strong understanding of IT, but… limited formal risk management understanding”. Meanwhile, “risk managers have a strong understanding of the business and risk concepts needed for a good cyber-security response in the event of an attack, but a relatively weak understanding of the complex IT issues involved.”</p>
<p>“Treasurers have been talking about segregation of duties since back in the 80s,” says Lewis. Indeed, it’s still just as relevant today. “You have someone trading who can’t actually make the settlement instructions, someone who’s releasing the payment but can’t do the confirmation, and so on. You get this triangulation of validation, so you know what’s being paid, because it’s usually around the payments that the fraud happens if it’s going to.”</p>
<p>For Lewis, a key figure in the management and mitigation of operational risk is the middle office. He explains: “Middle office function, in my view, is not part of the workflow, but is monitoring and managing the risk of the group. You’ve got a trader who’s got to stay within his limits and controls, but there is this second team that’s looking at the risk of the treasury department and making sure that all the players in that space are doing the job that they’re meant to be doing and they’re not breaking any of the Group’s policies.”</p>
<h4 id="the-fallout-risks">The fallout risks</h4>
<p>The consequences of failing to mitigate and manage operational risk can be severe. Financial consequences and reputational damage can cripple a company. As Ismail explains, it’s sometimes not through any fault of the company, but could be in relation to a payment that is made which seems harmless on the surface but results in accounts being frozen. “It’s not necessarily third party anymore, now we talk about fourth party risk,” she says.</p>
<p>Bohn recommends that institutions should have a framework in place to manage third and fourth-party risk from the sharing of confidential data. “Such a framework may require specific contract provisions, professional indemnity insurance or comparable guarantees and other minimum requirements for the supplier,” he explains.</p>
<p>The reputational damage that comes with poor operational risk management has the potential to be catastrophic. Consumer trust is essential for any business to function effectively, and Bohn explains that any breach “can undermine your franchise, your customer base, your investor base and your counterparty base for trading”. There are an estimated 2.65 billion social media users in the world, and with platforms capable of spreading news immediately, the results can be much harsher than they were 20 years ago.</p>
<h4 id="the-end-goal">The end goal</h4>
<p>For Bohn, the end goal depends on the type of operational risk being managed. There may be operational errors which have limited impact, meaning you can reverse them – such as a wrong payment – or there could be problems related to fraud which may be irreversible and require more effort to manage the impact. But, he adds, the focus should be on controlling the risk, then reversing the impact with a mitigation or crisis plan – learning from the mistakes so that they hopefully don’t happen again.</p>
<p>Ismail has a similar outlook: “Realistically, can we mitigate all risk? Especially the ones that involve the external environment, especially when there’s a fourth-party risk?” she asks. If not, she adds, it becomes about mitigating the risk to an acceptable level.</p>
<p>Taneja agrees that it’s unrealistic to expect a zero-risk environment. “Realistically speaking, some residue of risk will remain at all times, and that generally emanates from people-related issues,” he notes. For example, this could be finding that the expertise is not there, or that there are new employees joining and they have a learning curve ahead of them.</p>
<p>He continues: “I think the goal should be to keep risk at a manageable level, which means the framework should be robust enough not to have any major risks uncovered. Blind spots do exist and do come up once in a while, but by covering all the major bases you should be mostly protected.”</p>
<h4 id="going-back-to-basics">Going back to basics</h4>
<p>For Lewis, the end goal of operational risk management comes back down to the basic function of a treasury department. “Your job as a treasurer is to make sure the company has got sufficient funds,” he explains. “You’ve got to ensure that all the risks you’re mitigating, all the items that could impact the liquidity of the business, is looked at very carefully.” It’s important to have a holistic view, he adds, and to learn to prioritise the risks. “You work out which ones you’ve got spot on, and then you work down from there onto the smaller ones that are operational related but that won’t have severe consequences like the company collapsing in a heap.”</p>
<p>Building a business case for implementing enhanced risk management – which often comes at a cost – can be a struggle for some treasurers. Lewis notes that it’s no different to insuring a home and urges businesses to recognise that. “Explain that these systems are necessary to protect the business and that it needs to be something that is secure, controlled, and part of your remit,” he says. Using high-profile examples, such as the Bangladesh Bank heist, as a starting point is useful too, as you can then build on it from a cost savings perspective. “Cash seems to be the easiest way of justifying a risk system,” he concludes.</p></div>

<h2 class="h3 copy__heading">The Bangladesh Bank heist</h2>
<div class="copy__body"><p>The Bangladesh Bank heist happened in February 2016, when hackers used the SWIFT network to illegally transfer almost US$1bn from an account belonging to Bangladesh Bank. Most of the transactions were stopped or reversed, but the hackers still got away with US$81m. According to the governor of the bank at the time, he had hired a cyber-security firm a year before the event, but “bureaucratic tangles” in Bangladesh prevented the firm from starting work until after the incident.</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p>It goes without saying that we live in a volatile world. Global pressures from competing economic, political and social factors have combined in recent months to put a real strain on international businesses, local currencies and interest rates.</p>
<p>Between the Brexit saga, drone strikes in Saudi Arabia, the ongoing conflict in Syria, the US-China trade war, violent protests in Hong Kong and the threat of a global recession, there are numerous risks for treasurers to monitor. And as we start the new year, it seems our volatile world won’t be calming down anytime soon.</p>
<p>As such, there’s a growing need for companies to pay close attention to political risk. Take last September’s drone strikes at the state-owned Saudi Aramco oil processing facilities at Abqaiq and Khurais in eastern Saudi Arabia as one example. For some businesses, the strikes were completely unexpected – but for others, they came as no surprise. That’s a view held by Charles Laurie, Head of Country Risk at risk advisory company Verisk Maplecroft.</p>
<p>“Very rarely is an incident truly ‘unexpected’ – we had been highlighting the growing tensions in the region to our clients for some time,” he says. Following the strikes, the country’s oil production was almost halved, with Brent Crude oil futures surging by almost 20%.</p>
<p>“We believe the market has drastically undervalued what we call the ‘Middle East risk premium’,” explains Laurie, who recognises that mitigating against civil conflict or acts of war is highly challenging for corporate treasurers. “But understanding the local environment, having necessary contingency plans and responding swiftly can make all the difference.” But in order to take the necessary actions, treasurers first need to answer a pertinent question: what exactly is political risk?</p>
<p>According to Nicholas Fitzroy, Director of Risk Briefing and Middle East analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), political risk is notoriously broad and difficult to define. That said, it is largely about tracking political decisions and the resulting actions which impact a business’ ability to reach its goals – normally in terms of profit and/or revenue. For example, the drone strikes in Saudi Arabia have since been attributed to events surrounding the Saudi Arabian intervention in the Yemeni Civil War.</p>
<p>“What is most important to note when it comes to political risk is that the actors making these decisions are normally governments – but certainly, and increasingly, not always,” says Fitzroy. “Terrorist groups, nationalist movements and hacktivists (cyber-criminals) are all examples of groups that can create significant political risks for companies without being anywhere near government.”</p>
<p>In basic terms, political risk can be defined as any political event, or the results of any decision that has the potential to negatively impact commercial activities. This risk is often grouped and analysed on macro and micro levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Macro-level risks are those which impact all businesses operating within a specific region. These risks are often widely discussed in the media and include: political and civil unrest (eg Brexit uncertainty/protests in Hong Kong), energy-price volatility (eg Saudi Arabian drone strikes), terrorism (eg the ongoing war against ISIS in the Middle East) and civil or cross-border conflict (eg Turkey in Syria or Russia in the Ukraine).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Micro-level risks are firm or industry-specific risks. These types of risks are, by their very nature, discriminatory. This category includes the risk of a government nullifying a contract with a certain business, or the risk that a terrorist group will target a certain company’s operations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“In terms of the actual risks themselves, the broad nature of the political risk definition highlights how wide-ranging it can be; from warfare and social unrest, to shifts in governmental policy and regulatory environment, to things like cyber threats and environmental boycotts,” says Fitzroy. As such, there is no doubt that political risk is hard to characterise.</p>
<h4 id="impact-and-management">Impact and management</h4>
<p>Yet savvy investors know that any rise in political risk has the ability to negatively impact both a country and the companies operating within its borders. This is because political risk can do real damage to credit ratings and equity prices, and many countries experiencing political risk are often destabilised through reduced foreign direct investment (FDI).</p>
<p>Any reduction in FDI has the potential to slow economic growth and increase social unrest, inequality and corruption, not to mention a reduction in wages and the value of international equities.</p>
<p>In addition, these issues can affect other asset classes. For example, should a country experience slower economic growth due to a reduction in FDI, this can impact its ability to repay its debts, which would then have a detrimental impact on bond markets. Such events could also exacerbate currency-related issues, because any reduction in the value of a country’s currency could lead to slower exports which would also stall economic growth. Yet before a company can even start thinking about how to manage political risk, the first step is to find a way of identifying and quantifying the different threats that the company faces. Armed with this information, the board can then analyse how these threats might impact upon strategy and the company’s ability to access and operate in different markets.</p>
<h4 id="assessing-the-risk">Assessing the risk</h4>
<p>A combination of political risk assessment and analysis is typically used for this objective. On the macro level, quantitative risk assessment considers the general attributes and variables of different political environments. Data from specific countries is aggregated to generate an overall score, allowing them to be comparatively assessed and assigned a graded risk level. A number of risk consultancies offer such indices, including both Maplecroft and The EIU.</p>
<p>“The EIU does two things,” says Fitzroy. “First, we measure and update 70 indicators across a range of risk categories for countries around the world. These indicators offer a form of early warning for future risk scenarios. Then, more specifically, we also create a risk scenario watchlist for countries in which we write and score the top ten-20 risks for businesses. This involves giving each scenario an impact and probability score, which we then combine to give an intensity score, allowing us to compare and evaluate, and ultimately to prioritise, certain risks over others.”</p>
<p>Maplecroft’s annual Political Risk Atlas includes short-term risks, such as the rule of law, political violence and regime stability, in addition to longer-term factors such as economic diversification, resource scarcity and human rights.</p>
<p>“We work across three defined areas that enable us to provide a 360-degree view of risks to our corporate clients,” says Laurie. “Our risk indices and predictive analytics offer a granular view of risk that is unique within the industry. These score 198 countries across 150-plus issues, ranging from civil unrest, to child labour, modern slavery, climate change vulnerability and government stability, which enables companies to pinpoint vulnerabilities in their operations, supply chains and investments.”</p>
<p>He continues, “This is combined with expert analysis of human rights, environmental issues and political risk from a team of 60 experts who help our clients understand what these risks mean for them and where they are going.” In addition, Maplecroft provides consulting solutions that draw on its data and research and are tailored to each client’s specific needs. These can range from a supply chain risk management tool, to horizon scanning for geopolitical issues, to developing a strategic human rights framework.</p>
<p>For the risk manager or CFO, the changing values of such indices can provide a useful starting point for identifying future risk events. To take human rights in Hong Kong as a recent example, if you wanted to look at the probability of large-scale social unrest breaking out, both Fitzroy and Laurie agree this could have been foreseen after the proposal of the Chinese extradition bill in February last year.</p>
<p>“The extradition bill was one of the immediate causes of the protests, but there are so many other indirect causes, such as wealth inequality, the quality of the living environment not being as good as it was before, coupled with the cost of living increasing rapidly too,” says Honnus Cheung, CFO, Asia and GM, China at Travelzoo. “Young people want to do something to improve the current situation.”</p>
<h4 id="the-four-ts">The four Ts</h4>
<p>Maplecroft’s Laurie believes that when it comes to political risk, context is key. In a world of 24-hour breaking news, treasurers need to know much more than just the headlines. It’s not just about finding out what has happened – it’s also about having a clear view of the consequences. Treasury needs to understand why particular risks matter and how they will impact on the overall business – not just in the present, but in six months, two years and more.</p>
<p>Taking a holistic approach to understanding how these risks interconnect is the most important step. But how can treasury do this? In our increasingly-connected world, data is the new frontier for risk management: it can help treasury understand current risk, the trajectory this risk will take, and how it will change.</p>
<p>Civil unrest is a prime example. Protests and instability don’t happen in isolation, so understanding the drivers behind these issues, such as corruption and the human rights environment, can help treasury pinpoint where disruptive events might occur in the future.</p>
<p>Once a political risk is identified and evaluated, companies can then begin the process of managing it. As is the case with other types of exposure, there are four main ways in which a company can do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Tolerate</strong> – one option companies may opt for is to tolerate the risk, concluding that the level of risk they face is acceptable and decide to proceed as normal, while monitoring it to ensure that it does not increase in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transfer</strong> – if a company decides that the level of political risk is too high, but still wants to continue operating in a certain region or country, one option may be to take out political risk insurance in order to shield the company, should the worst happen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong> – this involves taking actions that will reduce the likelihood of an adverse event occurring in the first place. That could mean lobbying a government in the hope of achieving a more favourable legislative outcome, or, alternatively, taking certain steps to mitigate the impact of a damaging policy decision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Terminate</strong> – in cases where the level of risk is deemed unacceptable, a decision may be made to terminate a certain activity. What is determined to be an acceptable level of risk may vary between industries and companies. To take an example, companies in extractive industries such as mining have little choice regarding the countries or regions in which they operate. A company which mines for platinum must operate wherever the deposits are, forcing them into sometimes volatile regions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For The EIU, these are clear methodologies that can help firms. But the key things for businesses to consider is where their assets are geographically financially exposed, and on which other businesses they rely.</p>
<p>The EIU’s Fitzroy continues: “This is important because the speed of information dissemination on the internet means that firms can often be reputationally damaged just through association, while complex global supply chains mean simply understanding a firm’s own exposure is not sufficient.”</p>
<p>Beyond exposure mapping, firms also need to have a system in place that helps to identify, evaluate and monitor key risks across countries. “One other thing to remember is that current stability is definitely not an indicator of future stability – so scepticism is useful,” Fitzroy comments.</p>
<p>Cheung at Travelzoo agrees. “It’s certainly not an easy task. When I do our budget, I will ask each respective Country Manager for more local insights, but I will also talk with respective bankers in each country to get the latest information. I also use The EIU’s reports as a reference, but with my many years’ of experience of the ups and downs of the economic cycle and political crises, these reports can only give treasury so much. Unless you know a country inside out, political risk will always be there. As such, diversification is so important – from a country or a product perspective.”</p>
<h4 id="the-road-ahead">The road ahead</h4>
<p>For The EIU, the two main things for firms to focus on in 2020 and beyond are reputational risk and geopolitical relationships. First, the combination of geopolitical polarisation, the soaring power of social media and the rise of ESG activism mean that businesses must analyse their exposure to potential reputational risks more than ever before – and it is still an area that firms find hard to manage.</p>
<p>Second, as with the example of conflict in Hong Kong, it is not simply enough to understand a particular market and its government – treasurers also have to understand that government’s relationship to other governments. The web of global geopolitics is particularly pertinent, with sanctions and trade tariffs being used as a weapon in geopolitical disputes.</p>
<p>Yet when all is said and done, political risk is dominated by human decision-making, which is notoriously hard to measure or predict. Not everything can be measured, and qualitative judgements will remain an important part of the field.</p>
<p>The EIU’s Fitzroy explains: “In order to give each identified risk scenario a probability score, the EIU recommends combining data on previous similar examples in the same or similar countries and, crucially, identifying a few triggers that could set off the scenario.”</p>
<p>While no one can predict the future, treasury does have the tools needed to anticipate political risk. Some risks are spontaneous, while others simmer for years. But it’s the combination of thorough research, due diligence and the assistance of advisory services to identify the risks – especially with regard to issues that corporates are not aware of – that can help prevent a detrimental impact on the business.</p>
<p>Being able to mitigate known political risks allows the treasurer to see into the unknown. Effectively handling known risks such as human rights and environmental issues, which have the potential to impact a supply chain, frees up both time and space to prepare for what the world – and therefore the business – might look like in 20 years’ time. “Where one risk ends, another begins – we help our clients see these, mitigate impact when they can and manage it when they can’t, because from risk comes reward,” says Maplecroft’s Laurie.</p>
<p>While political risk can never be avoided – particularly in today’s volatile times – those businesses that anticipate risk, and manage it effectively when the political heavens open, will be the ones best able to ride out the storm.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p><em>It goes without saying that Know Your Customer (KYC) has been the bane of corporate treasurers’ lives for many years. With more than 1.3 million bilateral correspondent banking relationships across the industry, and countless more for corporates, how is SWIFT meeting the challenges and the needs in this complex arena?</em></p>
<p style="margin:2em 0 2em 0;text-align:center;"><a class="button--red-stroke" href="/podcasts/know-your-customer">Listen to podcast</a></p>
<p>Following the 2008 financial crisis, regulators increased the requirements for banks to maintain increasing amounts of accurate KYC and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) information on all of their clients.</p>
<p>With KYC in the correspondent banking space being a serious issue for financial institutions needing to keep information up to date and secure, SWIFT launched the KYC Registry in 2014.</p>
<p>To date, membership of the registry has been open to financial institutions with correspondent banking activities, who use the registry to conduct KYC checks on their counterparties. Rather than every bank having to individually contact a counterparty to request KYC information, it can all be found in one place – the registry. More than 5,500 banks are currently using in the database.</p>
<p>But just as the financial community came together to solve the problem of KYC in correspondent banking in 2014, in 2017 the question was whether KYC was a challenge for corporates. “You can guess that the answer from the corporate community was a resounding yes,” says Sebastian Niemeyer, Senior Market Manager, Corporates &amp; Supply Chain at SWIFT.</p>
<p>It’s not surprising. In the very same year, Thomson Reuters’ ‘Cost of Compliance’ report found that it took an average of 24 days to complete the customer on-boarding process. Global corporates struggled the most as they had multiple banking partners across the world in different jurisdictions.</p>
<p>So, with corporate treasurers crying out for an all-in-one solution to solve the KYC headache, global financial institutions and multinational corporations came together to agree upon one centralised utility – and the idea of extending the KYC Registry to the corporate segment was born.</p>
<p>It was with this in mind that Treasury Today met with SWIFT and a host of corporates and banks at Sibos 2019 to discuss the roll out of SWIFT’s brand new initiative which aims to solve the complex and time-consuming process of ‘knowing your customer’ for corporates.</p>
<h4 id="challenges">Challenges</h4>
<p>“Corporate treasurers cite KYC as one of the top three challenges they face in their bank relationships,” says Marie-Charlotte Henseval, Head of KYC Compliance Services at SWIFT. This is because many corporates hold accounts with several banks and subsidiaries, resulting in time-consuming and costly reviews of KYC information.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, data is too often disseminated across multiple sources, and it can also often be incomplete or out of date. As a result, banks have to repeatedly follow up and update information with corporates. It is hoped that by extending SWIFT’s KYC Registry to corporates in December this year, it will make the process more efficient for both corporates and banks.</p>
<p>Henseval continues: “This unique and well-established utility already delivers huge benefits to banks, and its extension to corporates will extend them the same advantages, with a standard agreed by the community and a secure platform enabling efficient data sharing.” The opening of SWIFT’s KYC Registry to corporates is also expected to address the inefficiencies arising from differing jurisdictional requirements and the lack of standardised data.</p>
<p>“Five years ago, when we received a KYC request from a bank, all we had to do was send through the registration paper,” says Jimmy Zhang, Corporate Banking Manager at Pepper Financial Services. “Now they want certified organisation charts, passports of all directors and documents that provide the source of wealth or funds.”</p>
<p>Although banks are asking more and more onerous questions, which has been brought about by the increase in regulations, Zhang recognises that KYC makes sense. “KYC is becoming more than just ‘know your customer’ – it’s a comprehensive overview of the counterparty – after all, due diligence is crucial in a world where you have to know who you are really dealing with,” he says.</p>
<p>Daniel Ochsner, Member of Management at Würth Finance International agrees: “A lot of banks, local banks in particular, approach our companies all over the world and ask for information, but sometimes they have inaccurate documents or outdated information, so the quality is not guaranteed.”</p>
<p>To take an example, much of KYC documentation contains confidential information, and corporates have to spend an enormous amount of time in fitting password protected order directives, taking secure copies of passports and official identification in order to send to different banks.</p>
<p>“It’s just tiresome,” said Zhang. “Sometimes one bank isn’t happy with the information we’ve supplied and they want additional documentation – whilst it may be completely acceptable to another bank.” This need to provide documentation several times in multiple formats to respective banking partners is not only cumbersome, it is both labour intensive and expensive.</p>
<p>“It’s very cumbersome for us too,” agrees Ochsner. “Because there's no standard in place it causes a lot of work.” He points out that there is currently one part-time employee at Würth who does nothing but send KYC information to banking partners. “In the beginning this maybe took one or two hours a month, but with new regulations it’s increased year after year,” he says.</p>
<h4 id="learning-from-the-past">Learning from the past</h4>
<p>Despite the challenges that KYC poses – challenges that SWIFT’s new roll-out aims to solve – there have been many proposed solutions for solving the issue of KYC over the past few years. Most have either struggled to deal with the increased complexity of the challenge,or were simply not fit for purpose. “In my view, the difficulty with companies that tried and failed in this arena is that they need the financial returns to be sustainable in the long run, unlike SWIFT, which is an industry cooperative,” argues Zhang.</p>
<p>SWIFT’s Niemeyer backs this up: “Being a cooperative, co-creation is in SWIFT’s DNA in a way that is invaluable for this kind of task. We have a strong track record of running a KYC initiative with 5,500 banks and have a proven ability to standardise a wide range of KYC requirements.”</p>
<p>He continues: “Everybody is suffering from their KYC experiences. Whilst there are good reasons for it, corporates are in desperate need to see a solution which makes it easier for them because, quite simply, corporates are reducing the number of their business partners – sometimes just due to the pain of the KYC process”</p>
<p>Is it a chance to come together?</p>
<p>“Absolutely,” says Niemeyer. “Jimmy Zhang and Daniel Ochsner, representing the global working group with its 34 members, have been active contributors in seeing this solution come to life. We sit all stakeholders around the table and really discuss the KYC issue for corporates; is this information relevant and needed by law? We come together and fine tune what is really necessary and come up with a more efficient way to do KYC just by talking to one another.”</p>
<h4 id="a-dream-come-true-for-all">A dream come true for all</h4>
<p>According to John Colleemallay, Senior Director Group Treasury &amp; Financing at Dassault Systèmes: “The KYC Registry for corporates will be a dream come true for all treasurers, considering the heavy workload involved in providing the same documentation several times in multiple formats to our banking partners. We look forward to having a secure, shared registry where we can more easily and rapidly complete the KYC processes.”</p>
<p>Rebecca De Cuyper, Transformation Management, Corporate Coverage EMEA, BNP Paribas believes that banks have long awaited a solution which standardises, centralises, mutualises and validates KYC data and documents. “If both banks and corporates adopt the concept and maximise the use of the platform, it would mean that treasurers will be able to redirect their banks to the platform and as such reduce significantly the bilateral exchanges on KYC info collection,” she says. As such the time spared will be used to further build the relationship.</p>
<p>BNP Paribas is an active contributor to the initiative. By seeking alignment with partner banks, and contributing to the standardisation and market engagement, BNP Paribas is investing these efforts to enhance its clients’ experience. “Our digital client lifecycle offer integrates SWIFT’s KYC in full compatibility with BNP Paribas’ own interface, ‘Welcome’, which allows our clients to initiate and follow digitally their onboarding and account opening process,” says De Cuyper.</p>
<p>Today, banks are already able to access correspondent bank’s information through a standardised questionnaire (referred to as the KYC baseline), including the latest Wolfsberg Correspondent Banking Due Diligence Questionnaire (CBDDQ). As a consequence, banks are now able to implement enhanced and reasonable standards when it comes to cross border and correspondent banking. Not only is due diligence being proved, it reduces the need for any additional data requirements. With the extension of the registry to corporates, banks will also be able to access their corporates client’s information through a standardised questionnaire, designed with banks and corporate treasurers from around the world.</p>
<p>But when looking at how banks in local jurisdictions apply KYC across the globe, one thing is clear – it is not universal. “What we have found at Pepper, being a multi-national company, many banks in many different locations interpret KYC differently and apply different standards,” says Zhang. “That’s one of the main problems that this new SWIFT Registry will solve.”</p>
<p>Approval certainly differs in different jurisdictions. For Pepper, it can take up to two months for banks in Hong Kong to approve KYC documentation, simply because of their requirement to see original hard copies, which can only be sent by post. In contrast, European banks are more open to electronic options, which cuts down the time to approve a counterparty by weeks.</p>
<h4 id="a-price-worth-paying">A price worth paying?</h4>
<p>The corporate universe is of course vast, so it was important for SWIFT to ensure that the challenge was approached in a way that ensured that the new solution met the needs of every corporate treasurer, regardless of the industry they worked in.</p>
<p>SWIFT’s initial focus will be the 2,000 corporate groups that are already connected to its network and their related legal entities, simply because they have tried and tested, long-standing relationships. However, the intention is to extend beyond SWIFT-connected corporates over time.</p>
<p>Once the new registry is finally opened to corporates, it is expected that SWIFT will start exploring collaboration with regional utilities, and partners that can be plugged into or integrated with the KYC Registry, in order to provide a full customer experience to banks. SWIFT’s ultimate goal is to create a one-stop-shop for banks to access information about all their clients, irrespective of their type.</p>
<p>However, in looking into the business model of the KYC Registry for corporates, it is still under discussion. “To maximise chances for success, we will start with the same pricing principles that are valid for the solution covering correspondent banking today. We will evaluate this model in due time, as the service matures,” says Niemeyer.</p>
<p>BNP Paribas’ De Cuyper believes that contribution should be for free while the business model should cover the costs through consumption fees, and, if required, annual fees for banks deductible from a consumption cap once this is achieved. “The pricing model should foster a maximum adoption in the shortest timeframe possible,” she says.</p>
<p>For Pepper’s Zhang, KYC for corporates being free is a blessing: “Businesses will be saving on head count because they won’t need to have a dedicated person to do KYC.” Ochsner agrees: “If it remains free for corporates it will save manual workloads so we can free up some resources on our side and invest these resources in other areas.”</p>
<h4 id="the-road-ahead">The road ahead</h4>
<p>So, where next?</p>
<p>“What we need to do is get in touch with regulators in different countries to demonstrate the value of standardisation through the SWIFT KYC Registry for corporates,” says Niemeyer. “We have identified a list of ten countries where we are starting talks with regulators to ensure that their feedback is taken into account. The reflection of their local standards will help make KYC for corporates the industry standard.”</p>
<p>Ochsner argues the case: “I think SWIFT is the only provider which will be able to really define a standard and make sure that they have the critical mass for both corporates and banks.” It is a sentiment echoed by Zhang. “SWIFT was formed by the banks, for the banks and it is a trusted brand which is able to negotiate with regulators so much better than a new start-up corporation can do.”</p>
<p>Zhang adds: “If you look at SWIFT’s correspondent banking model it has been accepted by all the Global Cash Management banks.” He continues: “For years now, we have been crying out for a standard path, and having a KYC for corporates system in place will give us the standard we so desperately need.”</p>
<p>Besides standardisation, mutualisation and centralisation of the KYC data and documents, the validation service and credibility of SWIFT as a trusted partner since it was founded in the 1970s is considered as a real added value to adopt this digital transformative solution.</p>
<p>So will it become industry standard? SWIFT’s Niemeyer is confident it will: “We are on the way to achieving it – we did it with correspondent banking which covered 70% of global KYC requirements back in 2014 – now we are at 90%, simply because of the ongoing dialogue with the industry.”</p>
<p>But according to Würth’s Ochsner, it is in the banks’ interest to participate in this brand new initiative. “We have actually had cases where we were trying to on-board a new banking relationship which we had to cancel because we were not able to define what kind of KYC requirements we had to fulfil,” he says.</p>
<p>“For some banks it may be too much of an effort to do business, but this new initiative will make it so much easier for banks to acquire new customers, and that’s why it’s so very important that they see this as a chance to participate. I think there are many more opportunities to further develop this platform and generate more value.”</p>
<p>Zhang couldn’t agree more. “We need the whole industry to work together – both the banks and the corporates need to come together to get KYC for corporates to work,” he says. “The more corporates that join, and the more banks that join, the more likely that this will become industry standard across the world.”</p>
<p>However, when all is said and done, Zhang is under no illusion in recognising that KYC adds no value to a business transaction, but there is an overwhelming need to minimise and streamline the process as fast, and as efficiently, as possible. “Instead of being bogged down by the tiresome KYC process, we will have transactions happening faster and that benefits everyone.”</p>
<p>It's a sentiment echoed by Ochsner: “Many people have tried and failed, as it is not exactly a revenue generating opportunity for the customer, but it has to be done because there's increasing regulation – we just need to get everybody on board.”</p>
<p>As SWIFT’s Niemeyer puts it succinctly, KYC for corporates is ‘not about competition, it is about collaboration’. It is a major rulebook that needs to be followed to really deal with industry challenges.</p>
<p>How will the game play out?</p>
<p>It’s in corporates’ hands.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>It happened ten years ago, but memories of Lehman Brothers’ collapse in September 2008 still strikes fear into the heart of corporate treasury. The paralysis in short-term liquidity markets and wider capital market dislocation made refinancing maturing corporate debt nigh on impossible. “Liquidity dried up across the whole financial market,” recalls Stephen Hogan, Vice President Regional Treasury Asia Pacific at Deutsche Post DHL Group, based in Singapore for the past 14 years.</em></p>
<p>DHL has since set up a syndicated loan facility that guarantees access to credit in times of crisis, and the global logistics group spreads maturing debt across multiple years, ensuring refinancing never all comes at once. “If you were trying to refinance after Lehman’s it didn’t matter who you were, you couldn’t. We now pay to have committed credit lines in place because that’s what you need in a crisis,” says Hogan.</p>
<p>High impact, low likelihood black swan events, often only explainable after they happen, are in fact surprisingly common. Lehman’s collapse, 9/11, Japan’s devasting 2011 earthquake and its impact on the Fukushima nuclear power plant, and Iceland’s volcanic ash cloud are just a few. Black swans are destructive, particularly if they catch a corporate with thin margins and high gearings, or at a weak moment in its history. The Lockerbie bombing was struggling PanAm’s deathblow; BP called the Deepwater Horizon tragedy in the Gulf of Mexico the greatest challenge in its 100-year history and “threatened its very existence”.”</p>
<p>Black swans are difficult to predict and therefore plan for – thinking the unthinkable is after all an oxymoron. Yet an operational crisis can quickly develop into a financial crisis and treasury’s role in preparing for the unexpected is both essential, and entirely possible.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote>Relationships built up over many years enabled us to mount the biggest corporate financial defence of all time.</blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source">Dev Sanyal, Executive Vice President and Group Chief of Staff, BP</p>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>First and foremost, treasury needs liquidity on hand. DHL measures how much liquidity it needs on standby in its syndicated facility by running stress testing scenarios. It’s a trade-off between the cost of the facility and the damage wrought without it, says Hogan. “You need to balance the cost with the need, and the problems that may occur if you can’t access it.” Other strategies to meet sudden and unexpected calls on liquidity could include liquidating bonds, says Socrates Coudounaris, Chairman of the Institute of Risk Management. He points treasury teams to the World Economic Forum’s annual Global Risks Report to identify which risks and consequences are most pertinent to the business.</p>
<p>For companies that find borrowing challenging or want to reduce the cost of drawing on credit facilities, alternative liquidity preparation could include mobilising cash from within the organisation. Treasury could transfer cash from a market that is generating excess cash to one that is short or look to supply chains to discount receivables and free up working capital that way. It requires a transparent view of cash levels and good data, says Victor Penna who heads Standard Chartered’s Europe and Americas cash management team. “Every crisis has the same result – liquidity dries up. A really good treasury makes sure there are different routes for funding the business, so if treasury is caught out in one area it can utilise the other.”</p>
<h3 id="strong-bank-relationships">Strong bank relationships</h3>
<p>There is nothing like a sudden liquidity call to test the mettle of banking relationships. High-touch, trusted banking partners who understand the business and the market it operates in are key to survival in a crisis. And banks which know the corporate best and have long provided the nuts and bolts of its day to day banking are most likely to answer urgent demands for credit.</p>
<p>Witness BP’s 86-day, high-stake battle to stem the flow of oil gushing out of the Deepwater Horizon well. Political pressure and negative press, coupled with a downgrade in the company’s credit rating, saw some banks fall away. Yet BP’s long-term core lenders held steady, sure in the knowledge that the company’s strong assets, credit profile and the contingencies in place, would prevent insolvency. “Relationships built up over many years enabled us to mount the biggest corporate financial defence of all time,” said BP’s Dev Sanyal, Executive Vice President and Group Chief of Staff speaking in 2012.</p>
<p>Indeed, black swans galvanize and fortify treasury’s banking relationships and can lead to opportunities for the banks that stay the course. A crisis can act as a catalyst for companies to have a fresh look at their capital structure or lead to decisions to sell off none-core assets, says Lance Kawaguchi, HSBC’s Global Head – Corporates. “The relationship can grow closer because treasury is engaging with banks even more,” he says.</p>
<h3 id="umbrellas">Umbrellas</h3>
<p>Hedging is another vital tool, allowing treasury to prepare ahead by transferring credit, interest rate or currency risk to market counterparties. But just like assessing liquidity needs, it’s a question of judgement, bearing in mind interest rate, credit and currency markets start to price risk quickly as soon as the storm clouds appear.</p>
<p>Take Brexit as an example, says Andrew Lillywhite, Head of Treasury, Products and Distribution at Investec. He argues a 30-40% devaluation in sterling following a no-deal Brexit would qualify as a black swan today because it’s not priced into the market. It means UK corporates with exposure to a fall in sterling should make choices today whether it’s worth paying the price of transferring that risk to a bank, versus the potential cost to their business if the pound plunges. “The price of umbrellas is always highest when the storm is approaching,” says Lillywhite. “Treasurers need to be engaged with trusted relationships who understand their business and have an appetite to take risk off their hands,” he says.</p>
<p>Other strategies to offload risk could include diversifying suppliers or buying insurance so companies can pay for losses quickly, easing liquidity constraints and smoothing balance sheets. Insurance also protects against counterparty failures, but perhaps most importantly its purchase – or not – involves a thoughtful process which clarifies what the risk is, the scenarios where it could play out and the financial implications.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote>Try and break your organisation; then work backwards to see what you need to do to ensure it doesn’t break.</blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source">Socrates Coudounaris, Chairman, Institute of Risk Management</p>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>For treasurers who question if the right instrument exists to insure 
their specific risk, this process will flag the gaps, says Coudounaris. 
Brokers then advise companies what cover is available, and treasury can 
decide if it’s worth it. It was exactly this thought process that led 
some airlines to buy insurance cover for volcanic ash-related claims and
 others not to bother – until Iceland’s 2011 volcanic ash cloud proved 
its worth. “Once bitten twice shy; now they all do it,” says 
Coudounaris.</p>
<p>Moreover, the cost of premiums allows treasury to draw on an external
 view of risk. Premiums reflect the market’s view of the health of the 
company’s balance sheet and its preparedness, just like home owners with
 burglar alarms pay smaller premiums. “A premium is a proxy for risk so 
if the premium is high, the question is: ‘why is that premium high?’ 
Think of it like a credit rating,” says Peter Johnson, Senior Vice 
President at Marsh Risk Consulting.</p>
<h3 id="stress-test">Stress test</h3>
<p>Organisations with well-built and practiced crisis management 
programmes are best placed to navigate black swans, and reverse stress 
testing is an important tool for informing these forward thinking, 
well-planned scenarios. “Try and break your organisation; then work 
backwards to see what you need to do to ensure it doesn’t break,” says 
Coudounaris.</p>
<p>This could involve stress testing supply chains, particularly for 
concentration risk, so companies can identify alternative sources and 
know ahead what it would cost. These are just the type of strategies 
that would have helped Japanese auto firms better navigate the impact of
 the Thai floods in 2012 which revealed the fragility of international 
manufacturers’ supply chains. A deep dive into customer behaviour is 
also helpful for forecasting cash flows. “It reveals who pays on time 
and who pays late, from which treasury can deduce what proportion of 
revenue comes from late payers, and how many there are, all of which can
 have significant impacts on your forecasting,” suggests Mark O’Toole, 
Head of Sales and Marketing at Cashforce, a fintech platform for 
treasurers. O’Toole also argues that the growing frequency of black 
swans means treasury should increasingly plan for the grey area between a
 white swan world of smooth corporate strategies, and the unpredictable 
devastation of a black swan event.</p>
<p>Yet unlike banks and insurance companies where regulation now forces 
stress tests, the average corporate doesn’t have to comply with capital 
adequacy or solvency regulation. Although FTSE listed companies must 
meet governance codes in line with Financial Reporting Council, FRC, 
rules, filing corporate accounts and an audit from one of the ‘big four’
 doesn’t equate to stress testing. Nor is it something that can be 
easily done on an Excel spreadsheet, says Standard Chartered’s Penna.</p>
<p>Stress testing tends to be confined to sophisticated companies which 
have learnt hard lessons from their exposure to global markets and seen 
first-hand how risk bleeds from a plunging currency to a hike in 
interest rates. “It is not easy to run scenarios; it needs good tools 
and the firms that are able to do it have invested in the risk 
management systems that can run the models,” says Desiree Pires, Co-Head
 of UK Corporate Sales, Financial Markets at Standard Chartered. “That 
said, TMS tools and other software providers are making it more 
accessible. Perhaps the key part is winning over internal hearts and 
minds that it’s necessary.”</p>
<h3 id="board-buy-in">Board buy-in</h3>
<p>Without regulation, successful crisis management needs to come from 
the board, which must also lead on instilling a risk management culture.
 Preparing for a cyber-attack is a good way to structure a whole company
 response to unpredictable risk, suggests Johnson. “Nowhere is the 
need for a multi-disciplinary response more apparent than in cyber 
risk,” he says, evoking a battlefield to describe how companies should 
respond. In-house cyber-security teams are the frontline, supported by a
 central risk function that has identified the risk and set out a 
response. This is then backed by a board that asks the right questions 
and holds the risk function to account. Boards should also counsel 
outside opinions to ensure they aren’t marking their own homework, 
advises Investec’s Lillywhite. Risks diminish in our minds with 
stability and this allows us to ignore potential dangers: once they 
happen it is often too late to manage them, he says.</p>
<p>Companies with board buy-in can then relax. DHL doesn’t discuss black
 swans in everyday risk management. Nor is it a topic regularly fed up 
through treasury to the board, says Hogan. “Our risk management 
discussions focus on our reaction to events that have a bit of a 
likelihood of happening. We rarely discuss the unthinkable; we don’t 
really discuss black swans.”</p>
<h3 id="work-remotely">Work remotely</h3>
<p>Treasury also needs robust IT networks that ensure the ability to 
work remotely. This was crucial for DHL’s Japanese subsidiaries 
following the earthquake and tsunami, says Hogan. “We needed to be able 
to keep the business running locally, despite the impact on the 
country.” Remote payments also enabled DHL to pay staff and colleagues 
struggling in the aftermath. In fact, technology is so crucial to 
companies’ ability to survive the unexpected, treasury should only work 
with banks that are investing in new platforms and mobile, says HSBC’s 
Kawaguchi who warns that “not all banks do”. More cygnet than swan, but 
unexpected and damaging none the less, Kawaguchi recalls an M&amp;A 
transaction were the buyer was unable to get into their office to 
transfer funds and couldn’t send the money remotely either. “I remember 
sitting in a room with the client, waiting for funds to come in from 
another financial institution so we could finalise an acquisition. You 
need that transfer to run smoothly whatever happens,” he says.</p>
<p>Companies that come through unprecedented crises emerge stronger, and
 many of the drivers of safety and risk management also drive value 
creation. For many companies it takes a sudden and unforeseen event for 
treasury to get its black swan fire drill in place. But it’s much better
 to prepare for the unexpected and think the unthinkable than get wise 
after the event.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>Where there is business, there will be risk. That is the nature of the beast. But just like businesses, risks are not static, with some rising to the fore whilst others lay dormant in the background. And then an incident erupts somewhere in the world, and those that were dormant are now very active.</em></p>
<p>Generally speaking, there will be commonalities in the risks that businesses face. The impact that these risks may have on the business is, however, very dependent on the nature of the business, the markets it is active in and a number of other criteria.</p>
<p>In this article, we use the findings from Treasury Today’s 2016 Voice of Corporate Treasury Study to hone in on what the key risks are for treasurers both today and in the future and then take a look at the strategies that can be employed to not only mitigate these risks, but in some instances, turn these into opportunities.</p>
<h3 id="market-risk">Market risk</h3>
<p>These have not been easy times of late for corporate treasurers. Intense volatility and uncertainty across the commodity and currency markets has become the norm, causing many headaches for practitioners. This challenge has been reflected in our recently published Voice of Corporate Treasury Study, which found that currency volatility and commodity prices currently rank amongst the top five risks for treasurers around the world.</p>
<p>Although the management of market risk is certainly not a new area of focus for corporate treasury, new realities are demanding new approaches. Most notably the need to be proactive in the management of these risks.</p>
<h4 id="treasury-challenges">Treasury challenges</h4>
<p>The incessant tide of commodity and currency price fluctuations has created a glut of challenges for the corporate treasury department, especially around accounting and forecasting. If these risks are not managed correctly, then these swings can have a significant impact on the treasury operation, creating losses and perhaps even the potential risk of a ratings downgrade and an increased cost of access to capital. The impact can be even more profound on a company’s share price, creating uncertainty in the value of the company and drawing the attention of the boardroom.</p>
<p>But many corporate treasury departments are not in a position to manage these risks sufficiently. “Generally speaking, to manage these risks proactively corporate treasury departments need greater transparency over their asset classes across the business than they currently have,” says Mark O’Toole, Vice President, Commodities and Treasury Solutions at OpenLink. “In doing so they will be in a better position to view their cash and risks in real-time which is crucial.”</p>
<p>Achieving this, as many treasurers will attest to, is very difficult. As they have expanded, companies have seen departments become autonomous units in their own right, adopting their own technology to meet their specific needs. In the finance function alone it is typical for there to be between three and seven different systems in place just to manage day-to-day operations.</p>
<p>When managing risk, treasury will typically extract all this information and enter this into a spreadsheet. “These processes can take a considerable amount of time depending on the complexity of the organisation and the disparity of systems and data,” says O’Toole. “By this point the markets may have changed and treasury will be on the back foot again.”</p>
<h4 id="technology-matters">Technology matters</h4>
<p>This is beginning to change, albeit slowly. “The pressures to reduce capital expenditure and increase margins have forced the hand of the treasurer,” says O’Toole. “Gone are the days of running multiple systems to manage day-to-day business operations. Today, it’s all about reducing the number of systems and manpower to operate them, and having the tools to gather detailed insight into activity and gain more predictable outcomes.”</p>
<p>There are numerous players in the market offering holistic risk management solutions that can help corporates achieve this. “The existing base of best-of-breed treasury management system (TMS) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) vendors are continuously developing their products,” says Tobias Westermaier, Manager at Zanders. “On top of that we have seen a recent rise in specialist vendors addressing a specific element of the treasury process.”</p>
<p>Of course, all of these solutions will offer varying levels of functionality so it is important that one is selected which meets the specific needs of the company. But, no matter which solution is selected, it must give treasury access to reliable, complete and consistent data, available on a timely basis. Then, from this base, risk can start being analysed more proactively and holistically, perhaps providing the business a competitive advantage.</p>
<h4 id="changes-in-process">Changes in process</h4>
<p>Bringing all this siloed and inconsistent data together however, so that it can be viewed through a single window, not only requires a change in technology. It also demands a change in thinking across the company and the need for silos to be eliminated, fostering a cross-functional and holistic approach to risk management.</p>
<p>According to O’Toole, the companies that manage risk best have done this by centralising their processes and appointing a Chief Risk Officer (CRO) who will help drive a concentrated focus on risk across the company. “A CRO, who will have an intimate knowledge of risk fostered over many years, can help create a risk framework, shape the policies and then help all the various business departments understand risk holistically,” says O’Toole. “Typically, risk specialists were once few and far between, often concentrated within the banking sector. However, since the banks have begun deleveraging we have started to see a lot of these risk experts jump to the corporate side.”</p>
<p>The treasury department, with its intimate knowledge of financial risks could be seen as a candidate to take on this role. O’Toole advises however, that whilst this could work theoretically, a CRO typically will dive further into risk than a treasurer typically would, using a raft of complex tools to measure items such as Value-at-Risk (VAR) and potential future exposure. That being said, the treasury should be aligned very closely to the CRO and be a key ally in the management of risk.</p>
<p>With risk centralised at C-suite level, the CRO can work hand-in-hand with other executives within the business to create more sophisticated risk management policies and guidelines than perhaps existed before. Mark van Ommen, Director at Zanders highlights that this is a trend at present: “We are seeing many of our clients creating much more sophisticated policies. They are also looking to leverage outside expertise in order to understand what other companies are doing and the lessons that can be learnt from this.”</p>
<p>However, the creation of policies is one thing; these also need to be closely adhered to for them to be effective. To do this, van Ommen is seeing many corporates building dashboards to track risk performance. “In doing so they are not only tracking traditional key performance indicators (KPIs) but specific key risk indicators, directly related to the risk-bearing capacity of the company.”</p>
<h4 id="fit-for-the-future">Fit for the future</h4>
<p>In bringing the processes and technology pieces together, a corporate should end up with a single centralised system that highlights the risk across the entire enterprise in real-time. This will be controlled at a central level by a CRO, but utilised by various departments across the business, all of whom are aware not only of the risk faced by their function, but also that faced by others. And it is from this position that a business can truly begin to proactively manage risk.</p>
<p>“To do this companies can begin looking at stress testing and scenario analysis,” says Zanders’ Westermaier. “In doing so they will be able to see how their business reacts in different scenarios and put in place strategies and processes should these manifest in reality.”</p>
<p>For O’Toole this point is especially important. “Take the example of sterling in light of the Brexit referendum result, there is no telling what level it will be trading at over the coming months,” he says. “But by being in a position to proactively manage risk, you will be able to use scenario testing to see what the impact will be on the business and proactively manage that, no matter which way the currency moves.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, corporate treasurers should be a leading voice in the organisation over the coming years, developing and driving long-term strategic plans based on latest developments and thinking about what the future disrupting factors on the business will be. The risk management policies and procedures should reflect this and be integrated with, embedded in and understood by the wider finance organisation and business as a whole.</p>
<h3 id="geopolitical-risk">Geopolitical risk</h3>
<p>Deeply entwined with market risk is geopolitical risk. Indeed, as the world awoke on the morning of Friday 24<sup>th</sup> June, the British, European and even global political landscape had changed. The (arguably) shock decision made by the British people to leave the EU had opened up a Pandora’s Box of what ifs and maybes.</p>
<p>Brexit immediately sent shockwaves through financial markets across the globe. The pound fell to a 31-year low against the dollar, the world’s major stock markets plunged in volatile trading and bond yields soared in safe-haven government debt.</p>
<p>In the months since then we have seen further financial impact, including a number of investors rushing to pull money out of commercial property, the Bank of England adjusting capital ratios to free up more funding to individuals and businesses and the pound and stock markets continuing to show high levels of volatility. All the while, in the wake of the decision a political vacuum had appeared in British politics, at a time when the Isle was calling out for strong leadership.</p>
<p>Yet, for the corporate treasurer, this was just one of many incidents that have occurred in recent months and years that have required careful attention. Indeed, few would disagree that the world has entered a new stage of political and economic uncertainty, leaving the fortunes of businesses on a knife edge and putting corporate treasurers at the sharp end.</p>
<h4 id="understanding-geopolitical-risk">Understanding geopolitical risk</h4>
<p>Geopolitical risk is somewhat of a ‘catchall’ phrase that seeks to encompass all risks that are generated as a result of political decisions. These risks may appear in a variety of guises and can impact either individual businesses, specific sectors or the economy as a whole. Some prominent examples of actions that can create geopolitical risk include: war and conflict; changes in governments; regulatory changes; changes in the tax code; currency revaluations; trade tariffs; labour laws; environment regulation; and changes in government spending.</p>
<p>Yet, in some respects, even this definition is unhelpful because incidents such as terrorism, which is not necessarily committed by state actors, also falls under the purview of geopolitical risk. Geopolitical risk may therefore just be one of those ‘you know it when you see it’ issues.</p>
<p>But just because geopolitical risk is hard to define, it doesn’t mean that it is not vital to understand. “The impact of geopolitical risk on corporates is vast,” says Charlotte Ingham, a Principal Political Risk Analyst at risk and strategic consulting firm Verisk Maplecroft. “This risk can be operational in nature, in terms of the physical security of their facilities and staff or the potential disruption to their logistics, or legal, if you look at things like corruption risk and the potential ramifications of violating the US Foreign Practices Act or the UK Bribery Act, as well as financial.”</p>
<p>Beyond the operational and financial consequences, political risk can damage a corporate’s image as well. “There are big potential reputational risks for corporates with operations in countries which have poor records on democratic governance, political violence, or human rights,” adds Ingham.</p>
<h4 id="a-changing-world">A changing world</h4>
<p>So what are the key geopolitical risks that corporates and their treasury departments need to keep at least one eye on over the coming few years? Unfortunately, no business has access to a crystal ball. The past, therefore, has to be used as an indicator for the future. And there are a handful of megatrends that currently exist in the geopolitical space that are having a large impact on business operations and will continue to do so in the short term at least.</p>
<p>“More than five years since it began, we are very much living in a post-Arab Spring world,” explains Ingham. “While the obvious consequences of this are the greatly increased levels of political violence in Egypt and Libya – to say nothing of Syria – its consequences are being felt far beyond the MENA region.”</p>
<p>Indeed, as we have witnessed there has been a massive outflow of refugees and the significant rise in political violence in Europe and the US due to an increase in the frequency and intensity of terrorist attacks. “These changing conditions not only have implications for the security environment for business, but also for the policy environment,” she adds. “If you look at the extent to which security and immigration have been key themes highlighted in the debate around Brexit, and the way in which increased migration has exacerbated political polarisation elsewhere in Europe, you can see how this issue is creating increased uncertainty for companies operating across Europe.”</p>
<p>Yet, whilst organisations have evidently been impacted by these events, the actions of businesses themselves has also increased their exposure to new geopolitical risks. As Ingham explains: “At the same time as all these events have been unfolding, we’ve seen companies venture further out from home markets and rely on increasingly diffuse supply chains. As a consequence, they face an increasingly complex interplay of political risks.”</p>
<p>For the corporate treasury department regulatory risk is always front of mind given the impact changes in financial regulation can have on its operations. And, globally speaking, the regulatory environment is only increasing in complexity. Indeed, data from Thomson Reuters highlights that in 2015 there were roughly 50,000 regulatory changes made by 600 different regulators around the world. That is 150 regulatory changes every single day. Of course, it is extremely unlikely that all of these impacted the corporate treasury function directly, or even the organisation more broadly. But they may impact another party in the ecosystem, which may then have a knock-on effect.</p>
<p>It is highly likely that this trend will continue. Indeed, Verisk Maplecroft’s Regulatory Risk Index, highlights that 45% of countries are host to extreme or high risk regulatory environment. “The quality, stability and predictability of the regulatory environment is the most significant challenge facing business,” she adds. “Onerous regulation increases both the time and cost of doing business, while ill-defined, poorly targeted and unevenly enforced legislation creates significant uncertainty around compliance requirements.”</p>
<p>One notable example, from a cast of many, where the corporate treasury was directly impacted comes from a move taken this year by the Chinese regulators to limit the cross-border flow of currency through sweeping arrangements. The ‘window guidance,’ (an uncodified regulatory change) put a halt to the cross-border RMB flow, leaving many treasury teams scrambling for answers around what this meant and how it would impact their global cash management operations.</p>

<div class="copy__body"><h4 id="managing-geopolitical-risk">Managing geopolitical risk</h4>
<p>Geopolitical risk, in whichever form it manifests, looks set to continue to be a key area of focus for corporate treasury departments and the corporate operation more broadly. So how can this be best managed?</p>
<p>Having an awareness of geopolitical events and ‘hotspots’ that may impact operation either directly or indirectly (ie through the supply chain) is a key starting point. Much of this knowledge can come through keeping up to date with global news and also through an appreciation of the markets the business is operating in. Treasurers operating in China for instance, will be well accustomed to such incidents as the ‘window guidance’ and whilst this was a shock, it did not pose an insurmountable risk to operations.</p>
<p>However, sometimes conditions change very quickly, as was the case during the Arab Spring. These events are more difficult to plan for but there can be tell-tale macroeconomic signs – even in jurisdictions where political risk is not currently high – that can help predict regions where problems may erupt in future. One such example of this is a macroeconomic downturn, in instances such as these governments may become unpredictable and, in extreme cases, become hostile towards foreign businesses potentially impacting their supply chains or even seeing assets seized with little to no compensation.</p>
<p>It must be remembered that corporates are not alone in this endeavour and should look to obtain sound advice, from numerous sources including banks and political risk experts. When matched with the businesses own evaluation it can help to create a robust holistic risk-profile for each market. Moreover, in those higher risk countries, further steps may have to be taken, including: implementing appropriate security measures, engaging with local communities, and selecting lower-risk parts of the country to do business.</p>
<p>No matter what the level of risk however, it is important to have a resiliency plan in place should trouble occur. Here it would be prudent for businesses to identify its essential functions and address the impact geopolitical risk, of varying degrees, could have on customers, employees, and other stakeholders. For the treasury, this may be simply ensuring that payments and collections can continue as normal in the country.</p>
<h4 id="insurance">Insurance</h4>
<p>In more recent years, geopolitical risk insurance products have become more popular as a means to protect shareholder value, support growth in foreign markets, and help secure financing from lenders. But some companies are reluctant to discuss such risks until they pose an immediate threat; it is after all a cost that may not be needed. As with all insurance products though, it plays on the fear that by the time an event has escalated, it may be too late.</p>
<p>Credit risk insurance may also be a prudent tool to mitigate geopolitical risk. After all, in times of difficulty and geopolitical risk, risk of non-payment typically follows. This means that not only are the physical assets of the company at risk, so is the balance sheet.</p>
<p>Indeed, a recent report by French credit insurance company, Coface, highlighted how this is a current issue for companies operating in China due to the reforms taking place in the country’s economy and the actions taken by the Chinese government to tackle overcapacity and ‘zombie’ companies. The study highlighted that 80.6% of companies experienced overdue payments in 2015. For the treasury departments of these organisations a cash flow risk is created, which may manifest in late payments being passed down the supply chain, or seeing the need to obtain expensive credit from the banks, both of which cause further risks for the business.</p>
<h4 id="turning-risk-into-an-opportunity">Turning risk into an opportunity</h4>
<p>It is also worth noting that where there is risk, there is also opportunity. “There are a lot of challenges, there are also a lot of opportunities if the risks are managed well,” says Ingham. Indeed, those companies who take the risk and begin operating in difficult countries may gain a reputational advantage, should conditions improve, due to their association with the country.</p>
<p>Also, volatility and instability can create market opportunities. Adam Smith Awards Asia winners Larsen &amp; Toubro perfectly highlight this point. 2013-2014 was one of the most challenging periods in recent memory for the Indian economy, but it was one of the most profitable for the Indian conglomerate. Driven by its investment philosophy and an acute understanding of the country’s political and economic standing the treasury was able to generate an alpha of approximately 2.5% on investments worth US$1bn. An increase from the two previous years when markets in emerging economies, such as India, were relatively calmer.</p>
<p>It achieved this by proactively analysing the political and economic landscape in India and using this information to reinforce the company’s short-term investment philosophy. In doing so the treasury team were able to make informed decisions that saw it outperform its expected rate of return and largely avoid any adverse impact from the turbulence affecting the Indian economy.</p>
<p>Ultimately, given the impact that geopolitical risk can have on businesses operations, it would seem wise for executives across the company, including treasury to keep geopolitical risk at the front of mind. In doing so, strategies can be put in place should events take a turn for the worse. And although this may not be enough to insulate the business fully from geopolitical shocks, it will put organisations in a positon to either mitigate the risk as best it can, or take advantage of any opportunities that present themselves.</p>
<h3 id="cyber-the-greatest-risk">Cyber: the greatest risk</h3>
<p>At the same time that geopolitical risk has become a key concern for business leaders, so has cyber risk. In fact, cybercrime has been described by some as the greatest threat to every company on the planet.</p>
<p>Undeniably the risk to businesses is increasing. For example, in 2015 there were 38% more security incidents detected by businesses than in 2014, according to the latest PwC Global State of Information Security Survey. And it is likely that there will be even more the next time the study is conducted.</p>
<p>Successful attacks can cause significant financial loss to organisations. Although, there are no conclusive numbers, British insurer Lloyds estimate that in 2014 as much as $400bn was lost by businesses through cyber-attacks – including the attack itself, the subsequent disruption to the normal course of business and also fines. And as the number of attacks increases this number is set to swell, with Juniper Research predicting that by 2019 the cost of data breaches will be $2.1trn globally.</p>
<p>For a period of time, many organisations viewed cybercrime as something that would happen to others; this is no longer the case. It is a real risk for all businesses, in every country around the world. And the treasury department, which holds the keys to the company’s financial assets – a key target for cybercriminals – has an important role to play in ensuring it does it’s bit as the caretaker of these assets.</p>
<h4 id="what-are-the-threats">What are the threats?</h4>
<p>A prudent place to start for any treasury department concerned about cybercrime is to learn about cybercriminals and their methods. Where once cybercrime was committed by nation states, tech-savvy individuals and hacktivists, today cybercriminals are highly organised and committing cybercrime on an industrial scale. KPMG use the phrase ‘shadow corporations’ to depict this and to illustrate how they operate in much the same way as any other company – albeit illegally and unethically.</p>
<p>As cybercriminals have evolved, so has the data that they are targeting. “For the most part cybercriminals used to target intellectual property, state secrets or financial data such as credit card numbers, for instance,” explains Joshua Goldfarb, VP, CTO – Emerging Technologies at FireEye. “Although they still do this, their focus has shifted towards targeting personably identifiable information such as customer data, partner data, employer data and so forth, which can be more valuable.”</p>
<p>How the attackers seek to obtain this information is also ever changing. Cybercriminals have moved away from the ‘smash and grab’ approach where they would use malicious code bundled in malware in an attempt to breach the company’s cyber-security and extract the required information – which they still do to a certain degree. “Today they are far more sophisticated and are looking to steal a user’s credentials, enabling them to operate inside the company’s internal IT systems masquerading as a legitimate user, prolonging the attack and allowing a greater amount of damage to be done,” explains Goldfarb.</p>
<p>No matter which method cybercriminals use to attack a company, if they are successful in targeting the financial assets there are numerous issues which may occur for the treasury department, including: the severe disruption of operations, stolen data and of course, potential losses from fraudulent payments. Moreover, even if the financial assets are not targeted, then treasury may still potentially be called to action should the business receive a fine due to the loss of personal data – the European Parliament have proposed that businesses that do so are to be fined 100m euros or 5% of their global annual turnover.</p>
<p>If the direct financial consequences of poor cybersecurity are not enough to make businesses sit up and take notice, the reputational damage that may also be incurred just might. British telecoms group, TalkTalk, for instance, were victim of a cyber-attack that saw hackers steal the personal data of 20,000 customers. In the week following the attack over 200,000 tweets were made on the topic and a great deal of negative sentiment was built up. Customers also voted with their feet, losing 101,000 customers.</p>

<h3 id="checklist-fending-off-cyber-threats">Checklist: fending off cyber-threats</h3>
<p>In order to align treasury procedures with the most efficient security standards, the following outline some of the fundamental procedures to check you have the best chance to mitigate the risk of cyber-attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do you have a security programme in place, either with treasury’s own IT department or a provider?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are they working to ensure the correct security frameworks are in place for defining policies, procedures and controls?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have you engaged with all relevant security teams (your company’s and any providers)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are they proactively minimising threats posed by cyber-criminality?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are regular audits and tests being carried out?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the department aware of the latest security technologies and continually updating security procedures to maintain effectiveness?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When changing legacy technologies, are security measures being adapted to integrate new solutions (mobile devices, for example)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should the worst happen do you have business continuity plan in place?</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4 id="on-the-defensive">On the defensive</h4>
<p>Having a robust cybersecurity strategy in 2016 is clearly a must. But in the view of Goldfarb, the changing dynamics of cybercrime is presenting a significant challenge to organisations. “The attackers and their methods have changed, but organisations haven’t and many still approach cybersecurity no differently from how they did 20 years ago,” he says. “Companies think that by using advanced firewalls and locking everything down they will be able to keep people out. This is not the case, even the best defences can be broken down if somebody is fully determined to get in.”</p>
<p>As a result, companies need to pivot their thinking and whilst it is recommended that they keep doing all they can to keep malicious actors out, they should also accept that intrusions will occur. “Organisations have to approach cyber risk strategically and be able to quickly recognise when cybercriminals have entered into the company’s systems and act prominently to stop the intrusion before it becomes a breach,” adds Goldfarb. “A robust detection and response process is vital to achieve this.”</p>
<p>For the treasury department this is especially important as recognising a cyber breach in good time can potentially prevent a significant financial loss. For instance, if malicious payments are being made and these are spotted early by the treasury team, the bank can be contacted and there will be a good chance that these can be reversed. The longer this process takes however, the less chance the bank has to reverse the payment. Best practice reconciliation is vital here. If a company can reconcile intra-day, or even daily, the better chance it will have of noticing these illegitimate payments.</p>
<p>The banks are also beginning to offer solutions that help mitigate the risk of payment fraud being committed by malicious actors. Typically, these solutions work by utilising a corporate’s historical payment data and a number of predefined rules that work together in order to flag up any irregularities in the payment being made. Therefore, if a fraudulent payment slips through the corporate’s own due-diligence work, it will be flagged up as soon as it hits the bank’s system should there be any irregularities such as a changed account number, beneficiary name, or a significant increase in the value of the payment in comparison to historical equivalents, for instance.</p>
<h4 id="cyber-insurance">Cyber insurance</h4>
<p>Whilst not a strategy to mitigate the risk of cybercriminals causing damage to the company, cyber insurance can be a way to limit the losses incurred. Typically, cyber insurance works by covering the losses relating to damage to, or loss of information from, IT systems and networks. According to the Association of British Insurers these policies can cover first-party risks, shielding the businesses own assets such as cash, or third-party risks, which covers the assets of others (customers, for instance) including the investigation, defence costs and civil damages associated with cyber-breaches.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Demand for cyber insurance has grown in recent years, according to Inga Beale, CEO of insurance firm Lloyd’s, who told Fortune magazine that in 2014 “the insurance industry took in $2.5bn in premiums on policies to protect companies from losses resulting from hacks. That was up from around $2bn a year before, and less than $1bn two years before that.”</p>
<h4 id="people-factor">People factor</h4>
<p>It must be remembered, however, that although these products and strategies can help to mitigate cyber risk, it is people that are a businesses’ first and last line of defence. The aforementioned PwC survey, for instance, indicates that in 2015 two-thirds of incidents occurred because of the actions of current or former employees.</p>
<p>And cybercriminals are only becoming more sophisticated in how they pray on human frailty to breach a company’s defences. Phishing emails, for example, are now more realistic and often are construed after careful investigation of the target through social media and other channels. As a result, these traps may only become more difficult to avoid in the future.</p>
<p>Education about the risks and how they materialise is therefore vital. A company can do all it can with technology, but ultimately if a member of staff falls foul of such an attack there is not much this technology can do. Companies therefore need to start working to build a cyber conscious culture across the entire organisation. This should be led from the top down and ensure that all members of staff, no matter what level, have the ability and means to question anything they feel is suspicious.</p>
<p>It is only when a company employs the right mixture of people, processes and technology that it will have the best chance of warding off any unwanted cyber activity. And if your company hasn’t started doing this yet, it should start before it is too late.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>When a core treasury system such as a TMS or ERP fails, either partially or catastrophically, you had better be prepared to take control. But how likely is this to happen? And even if it does, what can be done? Treasury Today looks at what happens and what to do if your TMS or ERP goes down.</em></p>
<p>You may believe that you have the most secure and dependable technology known to treasury-kind but the fact is, there are no infallible systems on the market. This sounds like a gloomy prognosis but system failures occur, sometimes without any warning. For treasurers, the key questions that should be asked are: ‘are you aware of the risk, and will you be ready to deal with the outcome?’</p>
<p>Catastrophic system failure resulting in a significant and sustained loss of access, loss of data, or damage to hardware or its total failure is extremely rare, notes Alex Ellison, an independent consultant (and a former Director of Treasury Solutions Business Development at SAP). In the event of a catastrophic or partial failure, she believes most “mission critical” systems within a large organisation will be (or should be) capable of ‘hot switching’ between mirrored data centres to allow almost immediate take up and continued use of live data.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, notes Bob Stark, VP Strategy at technology vendor Kyriba, most treasurers will have previously made the assumption that their system is well-supported and, as such, do not necessarily have a recovery programme beyond their treasury system being available. As a result, he believes that many will be severely tested when the worst happens.</p>
<h3 id="is-it-really-likely">Is it really likely?</h3>
<p>But what are the chances of a modern ERP/TMS failing to perform either catastrophically or partially? Outside of substantial physical damage caused by natural disaster or terrorist attack, for example, the risk really is uncertain says Tim de Knegt, Head of Strategic Finance and Treasury for the Port of Rotterdam. “With standardised processes, a good and integrated testing procedure, and knowledgeable people, there should be a limited likelihood of this happening,” he believes. “But real life experience shows us that system failure – including ERPs and TMSs – happens rather more than we might imagine in recent years.”</p>
<p>One of the reasons that there is a reasonable chance of failure of a core system is down to the model of deployment notes Stark. Although diminishing in number, an internally installed TMS is completely dependent on the configuration offered when it was deployed: if the in-house server goes down it will take the TMS with it and if IT has not built a fully redundant backup to take over, then treasury will be system-less for the duration. Similarly he says non-cloud hosted software runs the same risk with a single point of failure. “The risk is a lot higher than people realise because the majority of systems on the market are not true cloud and do not have the capability of behind-the-scenes disaster recovery and business continuity.”</p>
<p>In practical terms, the risk comes down to whoever manages the IT component: if it is installed on premises then it will be internal IT’s task to get it back. The majority of systems sold today are hosted and, states Stark, the vendor has 100% responsibility to ensure that their system is up and running and goes back online following disruption. “This is why many organisations are not choosing on premise any more – but then they must rely on the vendor having everything in order and having made all the right investments to be able to get you back up and running very quickly.” Service Level Agreements (SLAs) provide a commitment to delivery but if the business continuity and disaster recovery is not effective and downtime exceeds what is comfortable then Stark says it doesn’t matter whose responsibility it is, “ultimately treasury is made to suffer”.</p>
<h3 id="the-immediate-effect">The immediate effect</h3>
<p>Indeed, should the worst happen, there will be a number of immediate concerns to tackle and the absolute prerequisite is “to avoid, under every circumstance, panic and uncontrolled action”, warns Thomas Stahr, Managing Partner of Stahr Treasury Consulting and a senior treasurer of many years’ experience. This is where robust planning comes into force. In practical terms, the first task is to convene an emergency meeting with the most senior responsible personnel. “Designate an immediate task-force, ensure clear definition of tasks and responsibilities and enlarge it where appropriate and necessary,” he advises. This and all subsequent direction will form part of the business continuity plan (BCP), of which more later.</p></div>

<p class="quote-block__source">Thomas Stahr, Managing Partner, Stahr Treasury Consulting</p>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Back in the here and now, with the sudden loss of a TMS or ERP, the impact on the daily treasury process will straightaway hit payments, the reconciliation of bank statements and related cash flows on all external and internal accounts. “Still having ‘old’ permissions to get immediate access to the accounts with individual banking software would be an asset,” notes Stahr. “If not – and this is mostly the case – at least an up-to-date contact sheet for your bank account managers, with their phone numbers and emails, is a must.” In such a situation, he adds that re-learning how a fax machine works would be beneficial too. The same burden applies to all following procedures such as gathering information on exposures, maturities of trades, the need for new trades, and so on.</p>
<p>De Knegt immediately alights on the ability to make payments too and adds concern over how open futures positions are closed without a trading platform. He further notes that it will be necessary to somehow secure accurate market data and bank statements and to acquire cash forecasts from subsidiaries. The bad news in all this, he warns, is that the most probable immediate remedial action for treasurers will see them having to resort to a series of manual steps – typically calling upon spreadsheets and bank portals for essential activities – to make do until their workflows within the wider system are back online.</p>
<p>As events unfold in the minutes and hours following a major technical event, Stahr is adamant that not only is it essential to have treasury personnel with a solid grounding in all underlying treasury processes but also that a “good team-spirit” pervades the entire operation. “It must be clear to everybody that nine-to-five days are suspended as long the problem exist,” he cautions. As such, “serious but calm communication” with all stakeholders will be required of the senior treasurer. However, detail should be only as much as is necessary to avoid confusion. In the case of catastrophic system failure, all upstream process stakeholders – including accounting, controlling, the CFO and possibly even the Board – must be made aware of the situation without delay.</p>
<p>It is important too for certain downstream participants to be alerted: risk owners (business units bearing the underlying risk) should be clear that their orders for hedging need to be submitted now by e-mail or fax for the duration. Doing so by phone is not advisable says Stahr. “The phone line will be glowing hot anyway; avoid making the situation any more hectic than it is already.” Conversely, he warns of the need to keep awareness of the problem “at the lowest possible level” as far as external relations are concerned, avoiding reputational damage and stakeholder panic.</p>
<h3 id="after-the-fact">After the fact</h3>
<p>Once the worst has been contained there will be time for reflection. Post-event analysis should reveal any limitations. “Consider it as an opportunity to avoid it in the future by introducing a scenario-procedure guideline, keeping in mind that second time around it could be worse and have an ever harder impact,” notes Stahr. However, he advises treasurers not to wait for the worst to happen but to try instead to pre-empt worst-case scenarios and to present them alongside the usual risk-mitigation strategies to the risk committee.</p>
<p>To help mitigate the risk of system failure, both Stahr and De Knegt refer to a ‘scenario handbook’ which should be one of the first ports of call for any treasury system failure. Creating this will come either from experience or from stress-testing various ‘what if’ situations for disruption of the different functions of a TMS or ERP.</p>
<p>When initiating steps to mitigate the risk of technical failure, Stahr urges participants never to be afraid of thinking “unpopular” thoughts. For a third-party system failure, this may demand serious questioning of the vendor’s capability under pressure. If its response was less than satisfactory, he says reflect carefully and consider finding an alternative; this may be an unpopular decision but a working and well-supported system is an essential tool. “The risk of a fail is too serious not to take full control”.</p>
<p>Having a good relationship with a core system vendor is thus vital and it is a joint responsibility between the treasury team and internal IT not only to find the most suitable technology but, as Ellison notes, also to ensure that the vendor has continuity in terms of investment in R&amp;D and its own financial resilience. The impact of ongoing consolidation in the TMS market and the issue of ownership is one that must be considered in the context of product longevity.</p>
<h3 id="it-is-your-problem">It is your problem</h3>
<p>“In essence, responsibility for uptime of systems lies with the IT department,” says De Knegt. “However, it is quite a bit easier for a CFO to place this responsibility with the treasurer to ensure they are on top of the game and that there is an understanding of the implications and which risks need to be mitigated.” For Stahr, responsibility begins with the treasury user and he believes all should be obliged to escalate issues to try to resolve problems, even though this may temporarily create more work. “Never try to resolve apparently simple problems with workarounds – that’s no solution at all, that’s just a risk-increasing action.”</p>
<p>Rewinding to a time before anything has actually happened, Stahr has a further, if unexpected, take on accountability. He believes that some treasurers may be storing up trouble for themselves should the worst happen. “Running a TMS is on the one hand increasing the efficiency and safety of treasury processes but on the other it can allow treasury to drift into standard processes where tight guidelines do not permit the treasury manager individual thoughts.” Some treasury staff, he feels, are “becoming the function of pressing the right button at the right time within a strict daily, weekly or monthly guideline”. The net result is that in the event of core system failure, treasury personnel who learned the business “mostly as a non-creative job” and who are suddenly thrust into an emergency situation “are often not able to think in an alternative way”.</p>
<p>There is another issue to consider here concerning the level of treasury understanding. “What can be difficult for some is that maybe before treasury invested in a TMS the requirements were less complex,” says Stark. When investing in such a system, he notes that treasuries are not necessarily trying to recreate what they did before; they naturally want to take it to the next stage. “As they adopt the capabilities of a treasury system, there will be an expected increase in complexity. Suddenly it becomes that much more difficult to replicate advanced processes for anything more than a couple of hours at a time.”</p>
<p>Regardless of the origin of such difficulties, in the event of a major system failure, Stahr asserts that of necessity there may need to be a “quick and dirty education” on treasury fundamentals. “Assuming that there is anybody in the treasury department who has good practical experience working without a TMS, then only now will some staff learn those pure underlying treasury processes,” he comments.</p>
<h3 id="continuity-planning">Continuity planning</h3>
<p>Of course, as a general guide to maintaining treasury operations under emergency conditions, a Business Continuity Plan (BCP) – which should also include a Disaster Recovery (DR) plan – is an essential tool for any business. This should be clearly documented, easily accessible and regularly tested. BCP should cover likely emergency scenarios and provide the broad means of keeping critical business functions running following such an event – the emphasis being on ‘critical’, states Ellison. It will include input from multiple functions and cover the direction of people, locations and technology. The role of DR is that of a subset of BCP and is typically an IT-driven set of procedures that focus on the recovery of software, hardware and data.</p>
<p>A number of key BCP elements are noted by Michael Baum, Senior Manager, KPMG, in his December 2015 Insight piece in KPMG Corporate Treasury News. There are two determining factors that are the guiding principles for the generation of a treasury-specific BCP, he writes: availability and efficiency. The key enquiry when devising an approach to availability is to pinpoint the maximum tolerated period that any given process can be forgone. Importantly, identifying critical processes must primarily be the responsibility of treasury: all other steps – in particular IT technical steps – must be based on the outcome of this analysis. “Issues of possible threats, risk mitigation and security needs, particularly for time-sensitive treasury processes, logically lead to greater investment needs to protect availability,” suggests Baum. “This is where the second guiding factor comes into play: the efficiency of requirements needs to be ascertained to achieve the best possible balance between investment and risk tolerance.” In short, he contends that an exercise in prioritisation is essential not just for operational needs but in terms of economic effectiveness too.</p>
<h3 id="know-your-system">Know your system</h3>
<p>Of course, the best protection is never to let your system fail in the first place. If the right decision is made when selecting core technology, treasury dramatically reduces the chances of having to face a major disruption, says Stark. Indeed, under such circumstances, he feels total failure becomes “extremely unlikely”. If, however, treasury has made some incorrect assumptions around the capabilities of its technology, it could find itself in a situation where workflow cannot be brought back online as easily as needed. If service is not resumed within a comfortable timeframe then resorting to manual operations is almost inevitable.</p>
<p>To reduce the likelihood of a major technology fail, treasurers should therefore in the first instance ask their supplier (internal or external) what the backup plan is, should the system go down. Be sure to clarify what ‘backup’ actually means, warns Stark. Simply backing up a database to ensure data is not lost is one thing, but a treasury system is a vastly more complex platform requiring a whole new approach. Indeed, questioning and understanding whether a core treasury system is suitably protected may not necessarily sit within the skillset of the typical treasurer and there is a wide range of details within this line of enquiry which must be dealt with satisfactorily. Unless fully conversant with the likes of SOC 2 Type 2 evaluation reports and the new Trusted Service Principles, Stark urges “bringing your experts into the room to make sure you are asking the right questions and making the right decisions”.</p>
<p>Ultimately, treasury must not be on an island from an information security standpoint, let alone one that meets all the needs for hosting, disaster recovery and business continuity. For Stark, the reason for adopting this viewpoint is simple: “It is not a pretty situation to go back to a manual workflow”.</p></div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>In the first of our new series asking corporates to consider various situations, Treasury Today takes a closer look at how companies can prepare for the worst. When news of a scandal hits, much of the focus gathers around the main offenders, but what about those left holding the reins? Managing the short-term reputation is just the start, as the treasurer is relied upon to keep on top of the reverberations in a rapidly changing environment.</em></p>
<p>As the recent plight of German automobile maker Volkswagen reminds us, the potential financial consequences that can be wrought when a scandal erupts are very severe. When the company admitted, in the autumn of 2015, that it had falsified US emission tests the headlines looked bad and the numbers even worse. In just a matter of days, the company’s share price had plunged by almost 20%, the company’s credit rating outlook was cut by Moody’s to negative leading to higher borrowing costs, and anticipating weaker cash flow and higher leverage metrics.</p>
<p>What began as a scandal emanating from Volkswagen’s research and development (R&amp;D) function, therefore, soon became a matter the company’s CFO, treasurer and other financial executives had to address. As Shannon Wilkinson, CEO of Reputation Communications, a leading online reputation management firm comments: “Reputation impacts every area of a company’s value from profits to opportunities.”</p>
<p>But while, in such circumstances, corporate finance teams may feel as though they are at the mercy of events, history tells us that how they and the rest of the corporate leadership respond will play a big role in determining the company’s fate. When scandals hit, the outlook in the near-term is inevitably gloomy. Companies can – and do – bounce back though. In this article, we will look at a few of the things that can make the difference.</p>
<h3 id="who-is-at-fault">Who is at fault?</h3>
<p>Often transgressions come to light in business which are confined to the actions of a few, culpable individuals. Clearly, the onus then falls to the rest of the company to show that this behaviour is not widespread and will not be tolerated. This means cooperating with authorities to ensure the efficient prosecution of those involved. As Ed deHaan, Assistant Professor at Stanford Graduate Business School, tells Treasury Today, in scandals where senior executives find themselves implicated, “getting new leadership at the helm is critical in setting a new tone for the company.” It does not always work. American Apparel has just gone bankrupt in the US over a year after ousting Dov Charney as the CEO.</p>
<p>Naturally, the corporate workforce often find their working world turned upside down when those at the top are stripped of all authority amongst claims of malevolence. Re-establishing lines of trusted communication, uniting departments and maintaining brand value, each present challenges. “Scandals create internal turmoil which can in turn prevent action. The longer an organisation takes to address this, the more likely it is that they will see a hornet’s nest forming,” says Reputation Communications’ Wilkinson.</p>
<p>The aim is for the whole company to avoid being defined by the mistakes and offences of a few ‘bad apples’. All eyes will be on the top executives’ first public appearance; Michael Horn, Volkswagen’s Chief Executive in the US, took the opportunity to admit that the company “totally screwed up” by cheating on vehicle emissions tests, for example. Expressing genuine contrition and setting out, unambiguously what measures will be taken to redress the situation goes a long way to restore public confidence – something which holds true even in scandals that don’t originate from within the company itself.</p>
<h3 id="restoring-trust">Restoring trust</h3>
<p>There have been countless examples down the years of companies whose reputations have been undermined by events beyond their influence. Back in 1982, for instance, the leading pain-killer (Tylenol) Johnson &amp; Johnson (J&amp;J) were selling in the US at the time had been tampered with; an unknown suspect or suspects having added 65 milligrams of cyanide into the capsules. Seven people in Chicago died, allegedly as a result of taking extra-strength Tylenol capsules. Once the connection between these deaths and Tylenol was made, J&amp;J were left to solve the crisis, in a way they hoped would minimise any financial or reputational damage.</p>
<p>Following prior-established guidelines, the company assumed responsibility for the product, ensuring the safety of consumers and medical professionals using its products as well as the employees and stockholders by conducting an immediate product recall. This amounted to around 31m bottles and a loss of over $100m for the company. That may have been a heavy financial burden to bear, but the measures were key to the restoration of public confidence in the brand.</p>
<p>Indeed, the influence trust levels between companies and consumers have on commercial success should not be underestimated. “There is asymmetry of information where the general public doesn’t know what type of people the managers are, what their intentions are and whether the company intends on following through with the things they’ve committed to – whether it be delivering high quality products or financial statements. We have to trust companies on these sorts of things,” says deHaan. If that company is highly reputable and the public believes it will ensure the delivery of its commitments – whether this involves third parties or not – then they get a premium in the market, he explains.</p>
<h3 id="the-weak-link">The weak link</h3>
<p>J&amp;J managed to re-introduce the Tylenol product by having triple-seal tamper resistant packaging, offering promotions and conducting presentations to restore confidence within the medical community. The tale does highlight, however, the need for corporates to take a proactive role in ensuring products that are associated with their company meet international safety and quality standards.</p>
<p>This isn’t a problem of the past, as numerous examples from within the last ten years attest: lead paint found in Mattel’s children’s toy in the US, Nike’s association with sweatshops, illegally-sourced plywood produce sold in Wickes and B&amp;Q UK stores and contaminated milk in China. Supply chains today are increasingly large and opaque and, as such, reputational risks are increasingly elevated.</p>
<p>Wherever products are manufactured, it is the corporates’ responsibility to understand the origin of products and minimise the risk of supply chain scandals. Knowing who your partners, suppliers and employees are is a necessary part of due diligence and taking every precaution when evaluating prospective business partners is essential.</p>
<p>When operating in countries which are less transparent, a heightened awareness about the potential pitfalls to avoid and local practices and laws is going to be necessary. Knowing what is (and isn’t) required within a country will eliminate the chance of unwelcome surprises. In other words, the potential of product scandal necessitates greater vigilance and active management at all points of the supply chain. “To the extent that you can take steps to avoid having a scandal to begin with, clearly that is going to produce a better outcome. Prevention is the best medicine,” explains deHaan.</p>
<h3 id="riding-the-storm">Riding the storm</h3>
<p>Should the worst happen, investors will be weighing up the costs of staying in or joining the stampede that could be destroying their assets. Not only that, but the larger public will be rapidly forming opinions which could create a much broader fallout. Acting responsibly during this time is crucial for businesses. A 2014 study, ‘Reputation Repair after a Serious Restatement’, by Jivas Chakravarthy, Ed deHaan and Shivaram Rajgopal explored the financial importance of repairing a company’s reputation with what the report calls “softer constituencies” – customers, employees and local communities, for instance. The results: people care when a tarnished company attempts to rebuild its reputation with goodwill gestures.</p>
<p>After announcing intentional accounting misreporting, the 94 companies in the study sharply increased the amount of reputation strengthening actions aimed at investors. This included: improving internal controls, a change in incentive programmes and announcing replacement of senior executives. But what the study found was that companies also reached out to non-financial stakeholders – in fact, 51% of efforts were focused on these softer constitutions. And the rewards were substantial; the researchers estimated that announcements of actions to repair and enhance the reputation of companies lifted share prices by 2% on average. “You must take a multi-stakeholder view of your company. A common mistake is focusing too narrowly on satisfying the regulators, investors and lenders,” says deHaan. Researchers describe ‘reputation capital’ as a genuine – albeit intangible – financial asset that is embedded in a company’s market value.</p>
<p>Reputation Communications’ Wilkinson says that ‘transparency’ and ‘authenticity’ are the key when it comes to protecting one’s reputation in the midst of a scandal: “Immediately acknowledge the scandal and share as much information as you can. Investigate what led to the crisis and share your findings with the public, as well as the steps you are taking to resolve the underlying issues. According to her, there are lessons to be learnt from the examples of the past. “Study the strategies of companies who have successfully navigated a major crisis, as well as common downfalls.” Whereas J&amp;J quickly responded with a plan of action, Exxon was very slow and inefficient in its management of the notorious 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska and it had a (well-reported) devastating effect on the company. Exxon’s chairman at the time, Lawrence Rawl, didn’t fly to Alaska until two weeks after the event. He sent a succesion of lower ranking executives and efforts to help the local community were delayed. Such occurrences suggest to the public that a company doesn’t consider an incident a genuine concern. As corporate scandals go, this is often referred to as one of the worst. The problem for companies seeking to avoid similar damage to reputation is: “Even very large organisations that have communications departments don’t necessarily have five or six crisis managers sat around waiting for the next crisis. They are not going to have the current knowledge of how a scandal is best managed,” says Nigel Pearson, Global Head of Fidelity at Allianz Global Corporate &amp; Specialty (AGCS).</p>
<h3 id="in-the-public-eye">In the public eye</h3>
<p>Part of the problem is that companies are often slow to react, then. And, in a digital age where news spreads like wildfire, quicker and quicker responses are necessary. This is evidenced from research from legal firm, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, which revealed that news of more than one-quarter of crises – including senior employee misconduct and bribery and corruption – spreads to international media within an hour and over two-thirds within 24 hours. As Kweku Adoboli, a trader convicted of fraud after losing $2.3bn at UBS, remarked in a letter dated June 2014 to a journalist at the Financial Times: “No-one in finance ever realises how close they are to the imaginary, transitory red line until they cross it and get smashed in the face by a million camera lenses.”</p>
<p>Behavioural crises (illegal or questionable by the company or employees, like the Adoboli example) were the fastest to spread through social media, over 40% within the hour. And because, as Wilkinson explains, “consumers, investors, prospective partners and journalists now conduct their research about companies, products and industry leaders online,” the role the media plays has an increasingly immediate knock-on effect on the value, revenue and operations of business which can be felt for a considerable time afterwards. According to Freshfields, 53% of companies had not seen share prices regain pre-crisis levels.</p>
<p>“If you wait until the media are leading the charge then you are going to be playing catch up when what you should be doing is establishing the message, rather than responding to it,” explains Stanford Graduate Business School’s deHaan. The interest in crises is certainly growing too as The Wall Street Journal’s ‘Crisis of the Week’ column illustrates only too well. Here, experts comment on current high-profile crises stories.</p>
<p>The recent TalkTalk scandal in the UK inovolved financial details of subscribers being hacked. There was zero transparency in the immediate aftermath and this is a good proof of the effectiveness of Wilkinson’s advice – had they have been more open more readily with their consumers it would have lessened the crisis.</p>
<h3 id="counting-the-cost">Counting the cost</h3>
<p>For the treasurer, the direct impact of a scandal means there is a need for tools to assess levels of financial impact, and, ultimately, to work out where the money will come from to cover legal fees, damages incurred, the potential use of other external experts, severance packages and so on.</p>
<p>When these sums become very substantial they can wreak havoc on cash flow and forecasts. Referring back to the recent example of Volkswagen, it is reported that the company has set aside €6.5bn to cover the costs of the scandal. Some analysts have claimed it could cost more, however. Credit Suisse’s most conservative estimate, for instance, is around €23bn – and according to the company’s latest earnings statement, it has €21.5bn cash on hand. It has been suggested that the group may sell off some brands (for instance, its supercar brands, Bugatti and Lamborghini) to raise capital; although Volkswagen has a fairly robust balance sheet, a capital raise is likely. What’s more, companies embroiled in scandal must brace themselves for a hit to sales and prices.</p>
<p>Referring to deHaan’s earlier comment that prevention is the best medicine, for some companies with the resources to do so, it may be possible, to an extent, to prepare oneself in advance for a scandal. Allianz, for instance, offer a stand-alone reputation insurance product. Pearson describes the approach as “aggressive mitigation.” Rather than trying to value a reputation, discover how much it’s been damaged and then indemnify for the damage. “The solution tries to deal with the reputational crisis as its developing and aggressively manage it in such a way that we can limit the downside,” he says. “There’s no consensus on how you value a reputation globally anyway.” Allianz Reputation Product works with global partners who are professionals at managing crises (expertise which can be of value since crises, by their very nature tend to be intermittent, isolated events and therefore those responsible for dealing with are often inexperienced). “Large media organisations that have reputational management divisions will help our insureds when crisis happens and we are looking for them to do that within the first 24 hours.” The value being, that corporates gain access to people who are used to managing ten or more crises a year, as well as a €10m limit towards media spending.</p>
<p>Although by and large they are unpredictable events, corporates can also take steps to think about the risks their company faces. “BP, for instance, could imagine the possibility of another major oil spill so they can produce a contingency plan including information such as who will be leading the recovery. There is some amount of pre-emptive work that can be done when it’s an obvious risk,” explains Stanford Graduate Business School’s deHaan. It does depend on the nature of the company’s business however, but can you afford not to explore the possibility?</p>
<p>As Pearson concludes, “if companies genuinely stress tested their response plan, they might be surprised and they might also look at what’s available for them in terms of aggressive mitigation.” Forces beyond our control have a habit of manifesting themselves, from time to time, but we can still determine how well we respond when such nightmare scenarios become a reality.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>A lot is at stake when a crisis hits – which, as recent times testify, can happen to even the most competent and unexpected of organisations. When an Australian cloud-based software provider got into financial trouble recently, administration bore the responsibility of telling all of the company’s clients that the treasury systems they had in place would be turned off in a month!</p>
<p>Whilst this may seem like an uncommon occurrence, it is one that illustrates a point around keeping alert to any potential source of disruption – including one of your key business partners experiencing a crisis: “You’ve got to challenge the status quo and continue to look at your assumptions,” says Glen Giffen, Head of Sales for Visual Risk. It may be a case of ‘once bitten, twice shy’ for those particular corporates who were on the receiving end of the software vendor’s own crisis but, for others who are yet to experience such misfortune, to assume that it probably won’t happen to you, and therefore avoid preparation, is a dangerous move.</p>
<p>While it is true that crises sometimes cannot be avoided, it is also true that the outcome can be influenced. The nature of a crisis (which specialist consultancy firm Steelhenge defines as an inherently abnormal, unstable and complex situation that represents a threat to the operations, strategic objectives, reputation or survival of an organisation) is best countered by having procedures already in place. Crises may also not be as uncommon as you think and include: natural crises, causing the loss of workplace accessibility or even total loss of real estate, for instance; technological crises involving single or multiple system failures; and crises of malevolence.</p>
<h4 id="prefer-to-prepare">Prefer to prepare</h4>
<p>Corporates should be looking to place themselves in the best position should a crisis – natural, financial or otherwise – occur. As Dominic Cockram, Managing Director of Steelhenge Consulting, explains: “When a crisis arises, it is a complex and chaotic environment – usually fast moving. Because the time to respond is precious, you therefore need to have planned beforehand and be prepared so you can react quickly, effectively and decisively.”</p>
<p>Business continuity and disaster recovery (BC/DR) plans are – although most companies hope they will never need to use them – the best course of action in terms of preparing for seemingly random yet potentially disastrous events. Of course, there is a thin line between preparedness and paranoia when it comes to planning, but a business continuity plan should help minimise the latter. It is a means of enabling companies to help themselves prepare for the worst and be able to recover, as well as sustain operations during and after an event as quickly and cost-effectively as possible. Essentially, a BC plan is a fully-documented agreement between management and key personnel (with the buy-in of all staff) that is taken in advance and which covers the steps the organisation, and particular individuals, must take to ensure critical operations are protected.</p>
<p>At its most fundamental level, a BC plan could be the difference between survival and failure. Even in purely commercial terms, being prepared limits the possibility of having to call for (expensive) assistance in a state of desperation. Moreover, “those that are prepared tend to be seen in a very positive light by their investors, and the business is seen as being well led. Those that fail to prepare instead show a lack of foresight and share prices suffer accordingly,” says Cockram.</p>
<p>The attitude towards crisis planning, however, is mixed. “Many businesses operate in high risk industries and take crisis management seriously, partly because regulation may require them to. On the other hand, some corporates are complacent and end up suffering pain when something does go wrong,” explains Cockram. It is important to understand what would constitute a crisis for your business and to ensure the core of your BC plan is sufficiently flexible to cover a multitude of unpredictable scenarios, offering sufficient protection against internal impacts across multiple geographies from local to global, as appropriate.</p>
<p>BC must also consider the external impact, including the likely effect on key business partners and the ramifications of their failure to operate on your own business and the impact of your failure on theirs. A BC plan therefore is best seen as a living, evolving and regularly tested strategy that will give a business the best chance of survival – should the worst happen. Disaster recovery (DR) plans fit into the picture typically as IT-driven procedures that focus on the recovery of software, hardware and data within the BC plan. The aim: to, at least, allow resumption of critical business functions following an event.</p>
<h4 id="overcoming-stumbling-blocks">Overcoming stumbling blocks</h4>
<p>Properly executed, these stages can provide a business with reassurance that it is prepared for the worst. However, a common problem is that within a company there is often no clear ownership of DR. There is a tendency for business operations people – including those in treasury – to assume that another department will take care of it, typically IT. Even if this is the case, colleagues in IT may not always fully understand how critical each business operation is. Thus, no operation should work in isolation when it comes to BC/DR plans. Of course, SaaS-based TMS providers would also have a duty to its clients to provide DR as part of the deal, but it is ultimately the clients’ responsibility to know what to do in the event of a disaster.</p>
<p>So, what is best practice? Wherever possible corporates should be looking to bring BC/DR processes into daily operations, rather than drafting an impressive plan which is subsequently forgotten about. Indeed, a recent report by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), ‘From Bolt-on to Built-in: Managing Risk as an Integral Part of Managing an Organisation’, advises against a stand-alone risk management function, citing the poorest risk management as “characterised by reactive crisis management once something has gone wrong.”</p>
<p>Proactive then, is the way for corporates to be. For Steelhenge, development of a crisis management capability is best described as a three-phase cycle involving: pre-crisis planning and preparation, crisis response and post-crisis recovery. The consultancy firm believes pre-crisis preparation should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Horizon scanning and risk assessment. Ongoing processes to develop systems that gather, monitor and interpret information that will give early warning of the potential problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Response structure. The structure of response staff should be based around the need to provide strategic guidance. Transparency in role assignment and responsibilities is required and the documentation of BC/DR should have a clear ‘lead of governance’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gaining experience and validation through rehearsal. Rehearsing the actual response processes within a realistic environment is, according to Steelhenge, “the only real validation of an organisation’s crisis response capability.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Should the worst happen, crisis response involves the following (all of which are made significantly easier with the existence of a plan):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Information management and situational awareness. Initially, there may be confusion surrounding the details of the event. Therefore, the team must quickly gain a clear understanding of what has happened and what could happen next.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strategic thinking. Intrinsically linked to the aforementioned point, those who are responsible for business critical decisions need to have the best and most up-to-date information at their fingertips.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leadership. There must be an identified leader with recognised decision-making authority and accountability. But remember: not everyone is cut out to be a leader in a time of crisis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crisis communications. Although the media spotlight is not directly relevant to the treasury function, key players have to inform and update the relevant people on developing financial and operational impacts. Where crisis communication is key for treasury, however, is in the information they provide to shareholders and relevant parties.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The recovery phase involves dealing with the longer-term impacts, taking the crisis as a learning curve and driving any necessary change to avoid mistakes being repeated in the future. This stage should not be underestimated in its complexity and, depending on the nature of the crisis, could take longer than expected.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom highlight-block">
<div class="copy__body">
<h3 id="the-cloud-and-crisis-management">The cloud and crisis management</h3>
<p>Cloud computing technology, where a large number of computers are connected through an internet-based communications network, has begun impacting the treasury function in a number of ways, including (and increasingly so) in BC/DR. The cloud allows companies to keep their backed-up data in several different locations and offers the benefits of both reduced cost and recovery time compared with some traditional solutions. But it is still important for solutions to be tailored to clients’ needs. Visual Risk, for instance, offers local backups carried out on a regular basis (something clients previously with the Australian cloud-based solution provider that ran into financial trouble requested). “Ideally you would have a combination. That is, if your BC/DR is cloud-based, you should also look at having local backups being made or backups to another site being made periodically,” says Giffen.</p></div>
</div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h3 id="best-practice-regularity">Best practice regularity</h3>
<p>You’ve got a plan in place and the company has spent significant time running through the simulation; you could reasonably assume you’ve done all you can to prepare for a crisis. But, as is well documented, the corporate world is continually evolving, as are threats to its stability. In order to avoid your crisis management capability getting left behind, Giffen reminds corporates “to have a regularly scheduled review of the parameters and stress test uses to see if they are still relevant. There is an onus to continue to re-test the assumptions you’re using.”</p>
<p>To this end, Visual Risk offers its clients the capability to run ‘what if’ scenarios and, according to Giffen, this is an absolutely crucial part of the process, to stress test your positions and understand what would happen in the case of a crisis. “For example, in a financially-driven crisis, you can use a statistical based measure – such as cash flow or Value at Risk (VaR) – to see what would happen in a number of scenarios (if interest rates moved in a particular way or a certain currency collapsed in value, for instance). This will effectively tell you what would happen with 99% confidence, after which you can overlay a scenario in a complementary way which sits outside that 99% and pushes the envelope.” Whereas statistical measures have boundary conditions, these ‘what if’ scenarios can test beyond what you would typically expect to see. “Try and come up with situations perhaps you thought may never occur,” adds Giffen.</p>
<h3 id="crisis-ready-culture">Crisis-ready culture</h3>
<p>Whoever is entrusted with BC/DR, internally and externally, it is essential for all concerned to have the required skills to be able to execute the plan in an emergency. An assessment of suitable third-party providers must be carried prior to engagement, but to ensure readiness of all concerned internally, the plan – and how to best realise it – must become part of company culture. As Cockram concludes, “after a crisis, you want to be able to say (and evidence) that every effort was made to prepare beforehand.”</p>
</div>

<div class="v-spacing--bottom highlight-block">

<h3 id="cloud-provider-checklist">Cloud provider checklist</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do you know and trust the provider? Are they reputable?</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>What happens when your contract expires or if you choose to change providers?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the solution meet not only your technical requirements, but also your business requirements, including regulatory compliance in the regions in which you operate?</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Bad things can and do happen, but rather like insurance, business continuity and disaster recovery (BC/DR) plans are things that most companies hope they will never need to use. Of course, this presupposes that business has a plan of action and that everyone knows what to do when the balloon goes up.</p>
<p>When something does go wrong, it is already too late to start worrying about plans. Naturally, certain industries face specific risks that must be anticipated – a mining company, for example, clearly has to be prepared for an underground collapse, flooding or fire, not just as a preventative measure but also to ensure everyone knows what to do should the worst happen. But how do companies prepare for seemingly random yet potentially disastrous events?</p>
<p>Firstly, it is as well to acknowledge that there is a thin line between preparedness and paranoia when it comes to planning; in most geographies the risk of losing an entire organisation in a biblical flood is surely quite low! But what happens if a major event prevents most or all employees from getting to work? What happens if there is a major power outage or computer connections fail for an extended period? Who takes charge? How will key business partners and clients be informed in such an event? Does everyone affected know what to do and when to do it? It is not difficult to think of events in recent times that fit this description; suddenly a plan seems like a sensible proposition.</p>
<p>The kind of catastrophes (potential or actual) businesses may face are many and varied and include: single or multiple system failure (such as servers, internet, telephone or power outages), the loss of office or workplace accessibility or even total loss of real estate (perhaps a result of a terrorist attack, fire or a natural disaster such as flooding, earthquake or storm). The loss of key staff in an air disaster or during a national or international pandemic is possible. Mass industrial action by operational staff too will shut down a business quickly, but less obvious personnel disruptions may also impact a business; in 2013 not one of the ten employees of a UK recruitment agency based in Liverpool turned up for work the next day following their syndicate’s £28m National Lottery win.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-business-continuity-and-disaster-recovery">What is business continuity and disaster recovery?</h3>
<p>A business continuity (BC) plan is a means of enabling companies to help themselves prepare for the worst and to recover and sustain operations during and after an event as quickly and cost-effectively as possible. Essentially, a BC plan is a fully-documented agreement between management and key personnel (with the buy-in of all staff) that is taken in advance and which covers the steps the organisation, and particular individuals, must take to ensure critical operations are protected.</p>
<p>At its most fundamental level, a BC plan may be the difference between survival and failure. But even in purely commercial terms, being prepared limits the possibility of having to call for assistance in a state of desperation (always very expensive) and goes a long way to maintaining or even enhancing client confidence.</p>
<p>For preparedness to be effective, the core of a BC plan must be sufficiently flexible to cover a multitude of unpredictable scenarios, as above, offering sufficient protection against internal impacts across multiple geographies from local to global, as appropriate. But it must also consider the external impact, including the likely effect on key business partners and the ramifications of their failure to operate on your own business and the impact of your failure on theirs. In essence, a BC plan needs to be a living, evolving and regularly tested strategy that will give a business the best chance of survival if the worst happens.</p>
<p>A key part of a BC plan is a series of functionally-specific disaster recovery (DR) plans. These are commonly IT-driven, focusing on recovery of software, hardware and data to at least allow resumption of critical business functions following an event. A BC/DR plan must also consider the effect on each function of the loss of key personnel by providing a contingency plan.</p>
<h3 id="key-elements-of-bc-dr-planning">Key elements of BC/DR planning</h3>
<p>According to <a href="http://DisasterRecovery.org">DisasterRecovery.org</a>, an independent organisation that provides guidance and information on disaster recovery, a plan must include the following stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A policy statement, stating the goal of the plan, the reasons for it and the resources required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A risk assessment will identify the situations that are most likely to occur.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A business impact analysis, describing how a catastrophic event may impact the business practically, financially and in other ways. It should also try to identify any preventive steps that can be taken.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recovery strategies must explain how and what needs to be recovered and with what priority/speed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The plan development stage will require documentation of the plan and implementation of elements as required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plan buy-in and testing is essential to ensure everyone knows and understands what the BC/DR plan is, what to do and when.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plan maintenance and testing is important to ensure it is relevant and that it works.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whilst third-party system vendors should be included in any BC/DR planning process to ensure they have the capacity to deliver when they are needed most, they should not be seen as a ‘get out of jail free’ card. Asking the right questions of them is an essential part of taking responsibility for DR/BC planning. Key points to raise (and include in any Service Level Agreement) would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How long will it take to recover operations following an event (referred to as the Recovery Time Objective)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How much data could potentially be lost (Recovery Point Objective)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reliability (proven up-time) of the platform.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is one thing having your own house in order, but how do critical system providers such as banks and core technology vendors view the disaster management process?</p>
<h3 id="the-core-technology-vendor">The core technology vendor</h3>
<p>Properly executing, these stages can provide a business with reassurance that it is prepared for the worst. However, a common problem, according to Phil Pettinato, Chief Technology Officer of TMS vendor, Reval, is that within a company there is often no clear ownership of DR. “A lot of business operations people – including treasury – think IT will take care of it,” he notes. Whilst this may be the case, those IT people may not always fully understand how critical each business operation is. This suggests a lack of co-ordination which, when creating a plan, is unhelpful at best. “Each business operation is responsible for ensuring it has a clear plan but that does not mean it can build and execute it on its own,” states Pettinato.</p>
<p>Of course, a SaaS-based TMS provider such as Reval should have a responsibility to its clients to provide DR as part of the deal, but it is the clients’ responsibility to know what to do in the event of a disaster. The same goes for the vendor in consideration of its own operations. Although Reval’s own IT function co-ordinates these plans, with guidance from an internal audit operation, ownership is very much accorded to each business unit. This ensures each is able to identify its own critical systems and operations and to put in place and test an effective plan so that everyone knows what to do and when in a co-ordinated manner.</p>
<p>Rather than isolating BC/DR processes, Reval tries wherever possible to bring them into its daily operations. By making them into “a second alternative to operating our business” and by actually using that alternative periodically they become ingrained into the collective consciousness of the staff, explains Pettinato. “Once a month or once a week we will operate using our DR platform; this is tied into the production platform to make sure it is operational.” He cites having seen companies build up “impressive DR and BC platforms, test them a couple of times and then forget about them”. But it is important to keep those platforms and procedures up to date and make them part of your operations. “If you are using it regularly you will know it works.”</p>
<p>The documentation of BC/DR must have a “lead of governance” in that it ensures the business does what it has to do, and that it is to the point in stating what to do in an emergency. “If you keep it simple you will be able to maintain it and operate from it on a regular basis,” notes Pettinato. Indeed, he urges companies to take a pragmatic approach to policy building. “If you over-document you will spend too much time managing that documentation.”</p>
<p>Reval’s practical BC plan for its own business operations (as distinct from its client operations) allows it to operate from a number of different offices and even virtually, with staff able to connect remotely if necessary. It has all of its core infrastructure and systems in professional co-location facilities that offer redundant power supplies, communications links and so on, and it also replicates all of its data in real-time using two different data centres connected but situated in geographically diverse locations.</p>
<p>With many companies globalising their operations, thinking in terms of operating from another location is not unusual. But Pettinato further urges companies embarking on expansion – especially through acquisition – to make sure that all operational locations are prepared for major events and, if possible, to try to leverage those locations in the BC plan context; having operations in the US, Europe and Asia for example gives fail-over options across a wide spread of time zones.</p>
<p>However DR is managed, simply backing up data every day and sending it over the internet to another location may have been okay a few years ago, but in a world of Big Data and complex analytics, losing a day’s worth of data is a big deal for many businesses. “Any company that believes it can get away with running a simple daily backup and restoring from that is clearly running a huge risk,” comments Pettinato.</p>
<p>Whilst best practices such as real-time replication are gathering momentum in this space, he has one further thought to share. “You need to think about what your backup for your backup plan is too,” he warns. “Once you have lost your primary system and you are likely to be on your DR platform for an extended period, you are on your own.”</p>
<h3 id="the-bank">The bank</h3>
<p>When disaster strikes, ‘keep calm and carry on’ would be a suitable adage for treasurers, but it would be hoped that the banks would play their part in keeping the machine moving. Routine operations such as making payments and checking cash positions become a serious challenge when a host-to-host banking platform is unavailable following a major event.</p>
<p>Banks are cognisant of this fact and Cindy Murray, Head of Global Treasury Product Platforms and eChannels, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, says clients in this situation will be advised to use the bank’s online banking platform as a means of carrying on in the interim. “If a client cannot send a file to us, they can go online to initiate urgent payments, including payroll,” she says. “If a client receives its banking intra-day and prior-day statements host-to-host, we can put those statements, in the same format, online as part of a disaster recovery plan.”</p>
<p>Incorporating mobile solutions into DR/BC planning is sensible but requires preparation. Accessing online banking requires the right people to have the security credentials and tokens necessary to function but they also need to know how to execute transactions in an emergency. “We recommend our clients test the process at least annually so that they know how to release manual payments,” advises Murray. She adds that it is also essential to have a process in place to avoid duplication of manual payments that may be contained in the original files if those files eventually make it through to the bank via the normal channels.</p>
<p>Whilst inclusion of banking in DR plan is crucial, corporates are curiously quiet when it comes to checking the preparedness of their key partners, notes Paul Taylor, Head of Sales, GTS EMEA, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. There is, he says, “an expectation nowadays that our products will conform to BIS (Bank for International Settlement) principles and stand up to any DR scenario”. Rules, such as the minimum acceptable distance between a bank’s data centres, exist “to give a level of common comfort” for clients, says Taylor. “But I think it is implicit in what we do that we could demonstrate our capacity to still operate as their bank, that we could still provide services and that we do have plans in place.”</p>
<p>The implicit assumption that tier one banks are prepared for the worst has substance. Murray confirms that Bank of America Merrill Lynch runs contingency production systems for each application from a different data centre. The system has the capability and capacity for ‘active-active’ operation for “mission-critical applications” such as reporting and payments. This means it can take transaction flows into multiple sites enabling real-time synching of databases. In the event of a disaster, there is minimal disruption because the data is already live.</p>
<p>“Banks exist to provide security and must demonstrate that we can function whatever happens,” comments Taylor. He believes there is increasing market interest in the sustainability of platforms, business models and processing capabilities. He also notes that the industry is seeing more co-sourcing of technology and more platform investment. “When you look at 9/11, at what happened in Japan in 2011, and at all the different security considerations around the world today, we could not predict these events, but we still have to be able to answer clients’ questions.”</p>
<h3 id="gaining-acceptance">Gaining acceptance</h3>
<p>Whoever is entrusted with BC/DR, internally and externally, it is essential for all concerned to have the required skills to be able to execute the plan in an emergency. As mentioned above, an assessment of suitable third-party providers must be carried prior to engagement, but to ensure readiness of all concerned internally, the plan must become part of company culture. This is the advice of Paul Kirvan, an independent BC consultant, member of the BCI Global Membership Council and TechTarget network contributor. To bring this state about, Kirvan suggests frequent communication to all employees – including briefings to senior management – of current BC/DR activities. This process could be used to demonstrate how the company’s programme can add value to their activities, protect their safety and wellbeing and even their jobs. BC/DR training should also be given to all new employees, with regular refreshers for existing employees. He further points out that acceptance by the company as a whole is more likely if senior management have bought into it, adding that formally enshrining BC/DR into policy – by stating that the policy is to be followed by all employees – will further drive acceptance.</p>
<p>However, Kirvan warns that BC/DR programmes may ultimately fail “because the organisation – at all levels – does not adopt and incorporate business continuity as part of its ongoing business processes and methods”. So, without across-the-board acceptance of a well thought out and managed BC/DR plan, it seems that companies should expect the worst when the worst happens.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>The world often turns to economists when ‘the finances’ aren’t going too well. But sometimes it seems that the professional requirement for this breed of expert is to predict what will happen and then to explain why it didn’t happen the way they predicted it would.</p>
<p>In fairness, risk ‘prediction’, and thus risk management, can be a very difficult task to undertake, even for trained experts. Financial risk management can be qualitative or quantitative but either way it is about identifying, assessing and addressing sources of risk. For treasurers without access to a lifetime’s accumulated knowledge and endless resources, the need is to shift the focus and response away from the ‘big picture’ of uncertainty towards market risks that are potentially damaging to their own organisations.</p>
<h3 id="part-one-watching-the-numbers">Part one: watching the numbers</h3>
<p>In doing so there is still a need to find the balance between breadth and depth but trying to remove all uncertainty is not necessarily the right approach, claims Yuri Polyakov, Head of Financial Risk Advisory, Lloyds Banking Group. He believes that businesses must establish an “appropriate degree of risk tolerance” and then focus on the major adverse scenarios rather than getting too caught up in mitigating the risk of all rare market moves.</p>
<p>Of the tools that are available, Polyakov says the focus tends to be on hedging strategy and accounting rather than risk evaluation. If a business wants to understand how much its cash flows will be impacted by FX risk, commodity risk, interest rate risk or inflation risk, for example, he states that there is no perfect tool yet available that can achieve that.</p>
<p>There is evidence to this effect. Procter &amp; Gamble talked at the EuroFinance conference in Barcelona last year about this problem. Its spokesman, Director of Global Treasury, John Byma, took delegates through the process of building its own risk toolset, driven by the absence of anything on the market to help. But P&amp;G is a company with assets of $139.26 billion (2013) and has the resources to undertake such a project. At the same conference, Jennifer Ramsey-Armorer, Director of Treasury for Canadian communications firm, BlackBerry, talked about how FX volatility represented a huge risk to its operations and that because no solution existed to predict this risk it had to call upon a neighbouring University for help. It ended up with an Excel spreadsheet macro that could handle the calculations.</p>
<h3 id="methodologies">Methodologies</h3>
<p>For better or worse, the solution for most treasurers without access to a risk department or huge resources still lies in the hands of their banks. As long as both bank and client agree on the methodology and, more importantly, the assumptions that drive the process, the results can be entirely credible, says Polyakov. For him, the methodologies are pretty simple anyway, “even though people can spend ten years or more talking about modelling the markets”.</p>
<p>He divides the process into three different steps. Step one is to model market uncertainty. “There are plenty of tools, methodologies and accepted algorithms that allow you to model FX rates, interest rates, commodity risk and so on – it’s not rocket science; there is nothing proprietary here.”</p>
<p>The key is not to try to predict specifically where the market will go, but to try to broadly understand where the market could go. The need is thus to uncover trends around each risk element (FX, interest rate, commodity price and so on) and the relationships between the different risk forces that act upon these elements, whether by studying current market implications or historical data.</p>
<p>Having made an assumption and modelled market behaviour around it, the next step is to consider the company’s business plan in the context of this model. If market uncertainty has been simulated and the company knows, for example, exactly when cash is coming in and in which currencies, and what its debt payments will be, it then becomes a simple spreadsheet exercise to generate an answer with a plus/minus range of acceptability, says Polyakov. “But if you change your assumptions, the results may change. This is where step three – stress-testing – is very important.”</p>
<p>By repeating the process with different assumptions it will be seen that some of those assumptions will have very little impact on results and some will have a huge impact. Those that do not have much impact are not a problem. “But if you realise that certain trends in a particular FX market, for example, have a big impact on your results, then that is where you should spend your time.”</p>
<p>Finding the areas of most impact will inform the treasurer’s operational activities in terms of hedging, for example. “But before you run off to hedge something, you should ask yourself if you can operationally change something to create the same level of risk mitigation,” he advises. It might be, for instance, more provident to reconsider the contract currency in which your buyers are operating. From a shareholders perspective at least, it is always better to optimise the business model before hedging.</p>
<h3 id="black-swans">Black swans</h3>
<p>In all risk analyses there are external factors that cannot be predicted but which can significantly impact the markets. Major terrorist attacks, the outbreak of war or civil unrest, financial meltdown, geographic catastrophe: all are seemingly impossible to factor into the equation but all could happen. Can a business realistically be prepared?</p>
<p>So-called ‘black swan’ events – those that deviate significantly from the norm and which are very difficult to predict – were first introduced as a concept by Nassim Taleb in his 2001 book ‘Fooled by Randomness’. Taleb has since progressed his theory and now argues that as we have seen so many different black swan events in recent times it is possible to imagine and draw up a list of almost every possible significant incident. We have no idea whether any of these events will happen or not, nor when, just that they could; this is Taleb’s concept of the ‘grey swan’.</p>
<p>“People are much more aware of the breadth of scenarios that need to be evaluated, but they need to be very clear that whatever the level of confidence in a prediction, it is not the worst case scenario; things that are worse can and will eventually happen,” says Polyakov. The only sensible response to this, he says, is for a business to have enough liquidity on its balance sheet to survive unknown and major disruption. This begs the question for how long would the business need to be completely disrupted before it became unviable, the answer to which can be found in the business model.</p>
<blockquote>

Major terrorist attacks, the outbreak of war or civil unrest, financial meltdown, geographic catastrophe: all are seemingly impossible to factor into the equation but all could happen. Can a business realistically be prepared?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, a large liquidity buffer is the only thing that will help if things become really disruptive. “You can manage risk all you want, but at the end of the day it is that unknown element, which can happen, that will hurt most,” warns Polyakov. The size of liquidity buffer depends on the business. Moody’s says Microsoft has $77 billion in cash; its arch-rival Apple is believed to be sitting on $147 billion. These are extremes, but all companies should take a holistic view of where their cash is and know that when calculating how much it needs the answer should be “a straightforward function of how long it wants to survive”.</p>
<h3 id="part-two-watching-the-banks">Part two: watching the banks</h3>
<p>There is no return without risk. And yet, as far as the banking system is concerned, the regulators seem to believe that their objective is to remove risk. They do things like applying higher levels of taxation and demanding ever more capital and liquidity against failure so that the risk shifts to another part of the industry. Then the regulators inspect the new source of risk and find ways of regulating that, forcing it somewhere else in the system. And so it goes on. “The logical extension of this risk management strategy is that we push risk to where we can no longer see it, because if we can’t see it we can’t do anything about it. That will not make the world a safer place.”</p>
<p>These are the words of Avinash Persaud, Emeritus Professor at Gresham College, a former Governor of the London School of Economics and Chairman of investment analysis firm, Intelligence Capital and London investment bank, Elara Capital. With years of experience in the field, Persaud knows that almost any activity can generate risk; it cannot be removed entirely and so the real question, he says, is how well it is managed and how easily its effects are absorbed. Banks may be regulated but they can still fail.</p>
<p>As such, when selecting a bank, as part of the due diligence process, a treasury should be aware of a number of indicators that could show that its prospective partner is heading in the wrong direction. The interesting factor is that none of these indicators require detailed numerical analysis.</p>
<p>Certainly for a treasurer seeking shelter from the ravages of recession, Persaud highlights three key areas of financial risk that must be known about any banking partner: its level of diversification (“concentration of lending in any one sector is a sure sign of risk”); leverage (“the less leverage a financial institution has, the safer it is”); and liquidity (“the shorter a bank’s funding, the more vulnerable it is”). But beyond the purely financial there are a number of risk factors that he believes treasurers can use as a measure of a bank’s susceptibility to failure. The first of these relates to the behavioural element of banking.</p>
<h3 id="remuneration">Remuneration</h3>
<p>With politicians talking volubly about bankers’ remuneration packages, many may feel a little uncomfortable about governments getting involved in private sector pay. In this instance, perhaps this view is misguided. “Everything that happened in the financial crash was incentivised to happen,” comments Persaud. The lack of a requirement to provide capital adequacy against certain contracts meant banks were not discouraged from putting them off balance-sheet, he explains. Bankers were thus effectively encouraged to swap credit risk, for which they had a capital adequacy requirement, and take in liquidity risk, for which they didn’t. “The danger of having stratospheric levels of pay in banking is that it creates a tendency for lottery-style risk-taking.”</p>
<p>Why does anyone enter a lottery when most people know they have a low chance of winning? The answer, says Persaud, is because there is an opportunity, however small, of “life-changing” results. Before the crash (and some may argue after it too) banks would pay many of its staff life-changing levels of bonus. Where such opportunities for individuals exist it creates a risk-taking culture that steps well beyond the norm. Understanding a bank’s remuneration structure can give clues as to its risk-taking culture.</p>
<p>In a competitive environment a certain degree of risk-taking seems inevitable but the regulators have talked a lot about increasing competition in the financial sector, notes Persaud. “The problem is that competition seems to have a trade-off with stability.” The banks that fail, he observes, are often the “challenger banks”. For example, before it imploded, BBCI was offering much higher rates than other banks. The Icelandic banks expanding into Europe similarly went too far too soon, as did the UK’s Northern Rock – all failed spectacularly by trying to break into new markets. “Aggressive competitive behaviour is often a sign of a bank that is going to run into trouble,” he believes.</p>
<p>Aggressive or not, all banks like to talk about how customer-focused they are. A bank that has a deep customer franchise that exists because of long-term client relationships will encourage a broad connection across the organisation, says Persaud. “How often does your bank introduce you to other parts of the business? The more your bankers try to broaden the relationship, the more it is a sign that they are investing in that client franchise – not the individual banker’s franchise.”</p>
<h3 id="relationships">Relationships</h3>
<p>Internal and external relationships play a key role in Persaud’s proposal. “There was a time when it was thought by some that there were too many bankers and insiders on the Boards of banks, that they were too cosy,” he notes. The thought that people with no preconceptions about banking could steer a safer passage rose to prominence on the back of a belief that these people would question every move. When the crash happened it was discovered that there were many such individuals on Boards, he says. This suggests they weren’t as inquisitive as they should have been. The recent case in the UK of the Co-operative Bank which was steered gracelessly into a wall by its CEO who was, it transpired, untouched by banking experience, serves to highlight the need for knowledgeable guidance.</p>
<p>But some banks are better survivors than others and another indicator of robustness is how risk is treated at the highest level. “There was a tendency for banks in the run up to the crisis to amalgamate their risk committees with their audit committees,” notes Persaud. The problem is that the audit function is very different to risk management: audit is more of a box-ticking exercise (albeit a complex and demanding one) whereas risk management is not. “The more you merge audit and risk, the more risk becomes a box-ticking exercise,” he states, adding that this is a dangerous state of affairs.</p>
<p>If internal relationships with Boards and clients are very important for a bank, the relationship it has with its regulators is vital. Pre-crash, many banks were “openly disdainful” of their regulators, says Persaud. Post-crash it was the regulators, alongside the tax-payer, that saved some of these banks. “You can still sense the disdain, but regulators are human beings too; they don’t like being insulted.”</p>
<p>When the regulatory authorities were considering whether to save Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers – two institutions that had “well-articulated disdain” for government regulators – he suggests that “there was no love lost” when they were allowed to fail. “There were other institutions arguably in similar positions that were rescued by regulators because they had a better relationship with their regulators,” he adds, further commenting that some of the huge fines meted out to banks today may have more than a passing connection with the state of their relationships. For a bank, attacking the regulator in public is seemingly ill-advised because if ever that bank is at the mercy of its regulators, the strength of the relationship counts more than it would like it to.</p>
<p>The key message to take from all these points is that a treasurer can manage risk using quantitative and qualitative approaches, and that although clearly the numbers have a lot to say if crunched intelligently, when assessing counterparty risk there are many other factors worth considering that can tell so much more. By studying all these elements and understanding the relationships between the different risk forces it is possible to make more informed judgements about future events – and that is as much as anyone is able to do.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Managing operational risk, or rather failing to manage it correctly, can be a costly business. Look no further than recent newspaper headlines for proof of that.</p>
<p>In January 2014, J.P. Morgan agreed to pay $2 billion in penalties to settle charges relating to its involvement in the Bernard Madoff Ponzi scheme. Some of the oversights in operational risk management highlighted by the US federal prosecutors’ action against the bank were startling. In 2007, for example, the chief risk officer of J.P. Morgan’s investment bank agreed to increase its exposure to the Madoff entity to $250m, despite the fact that Madoff refused any further due diligence of Madoff securities.</p>
<p>Last year Chinese securities brokerage Everbright Securities triggered an investigation of stock trading systems at all brokerages in the country after a glitch in its trading system caused it to mistakenly make RMB 23.4 billion ($3.9 billion) of buy orders. This systems slip was the largest trading error in Chinese stock market history.</p>
<p>But it is not just financial services firms that are subject to operational risk – it is a huge concern for corporates, too. So what should treasurers be looking out for and how can they help the company to stay on top of its operational risk?</p>
<h3 id="disruption-to-business">Disruption to business</h3>
<p>To answer these questions, it is important to first define and classify operational risk. In broad terms, it is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, human behaviour, systems or from external events. Examples can include fraud, by employees or outsiders, human error, and audit risk – where auditors may not understand the specificities of a company as well as an insider. External events that pose risks to corporates include movements like the Arab Spring that started in 2010, banking crises, such as the one that took place in Cyprus in 2013, and environmental risks, such as extreme weather.</p>
<p>What all these causes of operational risk have in common is their outcome: disruption to the company’s operations – which obviously carries the risk of financial loss. It can also create the less tangible risk of reputational damage. In some cases this may result in litigation from customers, suppliers or other stakeholders. Between 2009-2011, multiple recalls of Toyota cars over possible manufacturing faults were not only costly – forcing the Japanese carmaker to cut 750 jobs at its main UK factory – but also made a significant dent in the company’s previously decent reputation for safety.</p>
<p>With the economic shocks of the last few years making commercial life tough enough, it’s little surprise that corporates are intensifying their focus on operational risk and looking to plug any gaps. “Since the financial crisis, the majority of CFOs and treasurers have had greater responsibility for operational risk, which has led to more time and resources being devoted to its management. This is driving a need for greater automation through business-as-usual treasury processes, in order to give the treasurer the capacity to focus on these additional tasks. Operational risk needs to be dealt with in a long-term, strategic way – the best operational risk solutions balance efficiency with resiliency and sustainability,” says Mike Edwards, Head of Client Solution Design, Global Transaction Services, Latin America at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>One way for corporates to assess their ability to manage certain operational risks is through stress testing. This is where companies explore what-if scenarios and try to predict their impact on the business using computer-generated simulation models.</p>
<p>Other technology can also help. Straight through processing (STP), whereby capital market and payment transactions are carried out electronically using a one-touch system, is one option. “From a technology perspective, straight through processing really does help reduce operational risk, as it eliminates the need to constantly re-key information into lots of different systems,” says Shen Lee, Senior Manager, Commodities specialist in Corporate Treasury Services at Deloitte.</p>
<p>STP reduces settlement risk, as well as allowing settlement and confirmation information to be drawn from the same source. It also reduces the risk of fraud. “There are various levels of authorisation on these systems that do not exist with traditional paper-based systems, with records of log in times and details of who is doing what. This obviously reduces the risk of fraud. If the systems are built in the right way, it creates the right segregation of duties that makes the whole process much more efficient – and it mitigates risk,” adds Dino Nicolaides, Director, Head of Treasury Advisory Services in Banking and Capital Markets at Deloitte.</p>
<p>Despite the technology now available to help treasurers manage operational risk, oversights do still take place. “No specific infrastructure or system can be perfect, and there’s always the risk of human error or something falling between the gaps,” says Nicolaides. “But now a lot of big corporates are taking this very seriously. Operational risk management systems and infrastructure need to be revisited at regular intervals to make sure you identify, as the business changes and moves, how the infrastructure and the mitigating factors you have in place are adapted accordingly,” he adds.</p>
<div class="boxed">
<h3 id="regulation-impacting-operational-risk-management">Regulation impacting operational risk management</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>SOX</h5>
<p>– corporate governance failures at several large US multinationals in the late 1990s and early 2000s, notably Enron and WorldCom, drove the passing of the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act, which regulates internal controls and the transparency of financial reporting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>EU framework</h5>
<p>– in the EU, listed companies are subject to a governance framework that is a combination of statute and ‘soft law’, a term that covers recommendations and corporate governance codes in member states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Asia</h5>
<p>– regulation around corporate governance and operational risk management varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In China, for example, China SOX, or C-SOX, is the basic standard for enterprise internal control and has been adapted from US SOX.</p>

</ul>
</div>
<h3 id="a-risky-environment">A risky environment</h3>
<p>Environmental risk is an area of operational risk that is becoming a much higher priority for corporate treasurers, particularly for those active in some Asian markets. We will therefore focus on environmental risk throughout the remainder of this article.</p>
<p>In a 2013 survey of weather-related risks in Japan, South Korea, China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines, Munich Re said 45% of the major events in the 30-year period under consideration were floods. This was followed by storms (39%) and forest fires, heatwaves and droughts (16%). “There is no region of Eastern Asia that is immune to the threat of flooding,” commented Peter Höppe, Head of Munich Re’s Geo Risks Research unit, on the findings. The insurer said weather-related losses in the past three decades have caused losses of around $700 billion in Eastern Asia.</p>
<h3 id="eastern-asia-weather-events">Eastern Asia weather events</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Japan</h5>
<p>– in 1991 Typhoon Mireille caused a loss of $10 billion. Thirteen years later, in 2004, Typhoon Songda led to a loss of $9 billion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>South Korea</h5>
<p>– super Typhoon Maemi, which hit the country in 2003, caused a loss of $4.8 billion.</p>

<p>Environmental risk covers more than just weather-related events, although this is one of the biggest risks. There are two broad ways of looking at environmental risks. The first is the impact a company can have on the environment. This can potentially damage a company’s reputation and may lead to fines or penalties being imposed on the company. In extreme cases it may even result in a corporate losing its social licence to operate in a certain territory. For example, oil and gas multinational BP is on course to pay over $7.8 billion in compensation payments as a result of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>There are also risks from the environment on a company. These risks include anything in the natural world – for example a loss of access to water, earthquakes or flooding – that could potentially affect corporate performance.</p>
<h3 id="on-the-up">On the up</h3>
<p>Awareness of environmental risks is coming to the fore for a number reasons. One is that companies are being forced to internalise more and more of the costs of their operations.</p>
<p>“Previously companies were allowed to pollute many parts of the world in which they operated relatively freely. However with rising concerns over the health impact, the social impact, and the environmental impact of pollution, we’re seeing increasing regulatory stringency on the ability of companies to externalise those costs,” says Dr James Allan, Head of Environment and Climate Change at risk analytics, research and strategic forecasting group Maplecroft. The externalisation of these costs can take the form of carbon policies or technical requirements for energy efficient equipment.</p>
<p>The international expansion of many companies into territories where they have no experience is also making the management of environmental risk more of a priority. “More and more businesses are now operating in parts of the world where there’s a greater exposure to environmental risks that are relatively unrecognised. There’s a real lack of understanding of the level of risk in certain locations – for example, of flood risks in some of the developing parts of China, South-East Asia or some of the other growth markets,” adds Allan. In addition to this uncertainty, a large number of corporates also lack understanding of resource scarcity and its implications, which can impact their ability to function without business disruption in the long term.</p>
<p>Environmental risk is becoming more of a Board-level issue. Previously seen as a technical or engineering challenge, it is now increasingly considered a strategic one, which can pose a problem for directors who are not familiar with this kind of risk. “It’s sometimes difficult for Boards to identify the environmental risks that they might be exposed to across their entire corporation, and to know what sort of information they might need, how they’re going to process it, and how they can then make decisions based on the information they have been able to collect,” comments Allan.</p>
<h3 id="a-strategic-issue">A strategic issue</h3>
<p>The making of environmental risk a Boardroom issue has been driven in part by pressure from stakeholders, including regulators and shareholders, who want a clearer understanding of how corporates are assessing and responding to these risks. As a result there has been a trend towards greater disclosure of companies’ environmental liabilities.</p>
<p>The management of environmental risk can be carried out using a three-step approach.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Check vulnerability.</h5>
<p>A company’s vulnerability to environmental risks may be linked to its direct operations or embedded in its supply chain. The company can collect historical information on this vulnerability or information on the current risk exposure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Assess the risk.</h5>
<p>Identifying the high-risk areas is the next step. This allows companies to develop approaches to mitigate the ones that pose the greatest danger to the business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Implement a strategy.</h5>
<p>Once the responsibility for environmental risk has been assigned and awareness has been increased in the organisation, the company can start to manage the risk on an ongoing basis.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Financial risk transfer methods, such as weather derivatives, can prove an effective way of hedging against some environmental risks, particularly in emerging countries. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) lists more than 60 options and futures contracts on precipitation and temperature. The pricing of these derivatives is complicated by the fact that the asset underlying the contracts is not a saleable commodity itself. High yield catastrophe bonds, which pay out in the event of certain extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, are also available, though little used by corporates.</p>
<p>Technological advances have contributed to the monitoring of environmental risk. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), carried out jointly by NASA and Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR, the German Aerospace Centre) is a case in point. GRACE satellites collect climate change data across the world, monitoring minute changes in groundwater levels. Information from GRACE is publicly available.</p>
<p>“Technologically there’s been a real advancement in the information available and in the science underpinning it. In particular the information available on climate change is developing all the time,” says Allan.</p>
<h3 id="climate-change">Climate change</h3>
<p>Indeed, climate change looks set to become one of the biggest environmental risks to corporates in the near future. Statistics from Maplecroft suggest that by 2025, 31% of world economic output will come from countries that are considered a high or extreme climate change risk – that is 50% greater than the current output of such countries. Maplecroft publishes a climate change vulnerability index every year, ranking countries and cities according to their resilience to climate change risk. Companies operating in Asian growth economies in particular are set to face rising environmental risks over the coming decades, with Dhaka in Bangladesh, Mumbai and Kolkata in India, Manila in the Philippines, and Bangkok in Thailand ranked as the most at-risk cities in the 2014 ratings. Bangladesh was ranked as the most at-risk country.</p>
<p>The index is based not just on physical exposure to climate change, such as changes in temperature and precipitation, but also on vulnerability, including population sensitivity and the ability of countries to adapt to the impacts of climate change. “A lot of the growth markets are highly vulnerable to climate change, because they’re more prone to extreme weather events than some western European and north American markets, but also because they sometimes lack the same level of socio-economic resiliency to manage those impacts,” says Allan.</p>
<p>Though not in the top ten, Pakistan and Vietnam are considered at extreme risk to climate change, and Indonesia, Thailand, Kenya and China are considered at high risk. India was also highlighted in the 2014 study as vulnerable to climate change events. Maplecroft drew particular attention to Cyclone Phailin, which caused $4.15 billion of damage and wiped out key infrastructure in the country’s key mining region.</p>
<p>The United States on the other hand, though still subject to natural risks, is considered less vulnerable. In the 2013 rankings, New York was ranked 41 out of 50 cities in terms of its vulnerability to environmental risk and was considered medium risk – Maplecroft cited the city’s ability to cope with Superstorm Sandy in October 2012 as proof of this.</p>
<p>The Chinese cities of Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Dongguan and Foshan, the last three of which are located in the Pearl River Delta – the core of China’s manufacturing heartland – are said to be among the most exposed to physical risks from extreme climate-related events in the 2014 rankings. The inclusion of these cities may well be of concern to companies that use China as a manufacturing base. London and Paris were the only cities considered as low risk in the 2014 rankings.</p>

<h3 id="environmental-risk-checklist">Environmental risk checklist</h3>
<p>As environmental risk becomes more of a strategic issue, corporates need to size up the threats they face. Even those operating in territories considered relatively low risk could be up against what are sometimes called ‘unknown unknowns’. To assess the risks, there are several steps corporates can take:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Know the risk</h5>
<p>– what are the biggest threats? Which natural hazards and environmental risks could hit your region? These risks include floods, mudflows, droughts, mass movements, avalanches, forest fires, earthquakes and tsunamis, volcanoes, air pollution and water pollution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Know the solutions</h5>
<p>– this is often in the form of insurance. Derivatives can also be useful in hedging against certain weather risks, and in some extreme cases catastrophe bonds may be an option. Corporates can also speak to the national meteorological agency in their country and familiarise themselves with the latest data collection technology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Know the legislation</h5>
<p>– corporates also have obligations in terms of their impact on the environment. In China, for example, the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) and the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) require compulsory purchase of pollution liability insurance by companies with high environmental risks.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Where to invest short-term cash holdings in a global environment of low interest rates is a key concern for corporates. The amount of cash on the books of some companies is significant. For example, ratings agency Moody’s estimated that as of 30<sup>th</sup> June 2013, Apple had cash holdings of $147 billion, a figure that accounted for nearly 10% of all corporate cash held by non-financial companies in the country.</p>
<p>The total of $1.45 trillion in cash stockpiles across the US was concentrated among 50 companies, including Microsoft, Google, Cisco Systems and Pfizer. Companies with the largest stockpiles of cash were from the technology sector, followed by the health care and pharmaceuticals industries. In Europe, according to research published by Standard &amp; Poor’s in early 2013, non-financial companies have over €1 trillion on their balance sheet in cash and equivalents.</p>
<p>Bank deposits and money market funds (MMFs) tend to be the most popular venues for short-term cash investments for corporate treasurers. But unanswered questions regarding possible regulatory changes for MMFs and the prevailing low interest rates for bank deposits have boosted interest in separately managed accounts.</p>
<h3 id="separately-managed-accounts">Separately managed accounts</h3>
<p>First developed in the 1970s, separate accounts were designed to accommodate clients who needed to meet specific objectives that did not fit within the constrictions of a mutual fund investment. “More recently, there has been increased interest in separate accounts because there are a number of companies holding significant cash balances and they want better yields,” confirms Colin Cookson, Managing Director – Liquidity at Aviva Investors. “Also, there is some nervousness about which way regulators will go in terms of money market funds.”</p>
<p>US-based Money Management Institute (MMI) says the total separate account sector – retail and institutional – posted a 3% asset gain during the third quarter of 2013. Its SMA Advisory category recorded $11 billion in net flows, nearly doubling its $6.4 billion intake during the second quarter.</p>
<p>So what exactly is a separate account? A separately managed account offers a personalised approach to investing using a customised portfolio of securities owned by an individual or institutional investor. It is an individual managed investment account offered typically by an investment company through one of its brokers or financial consultants and managed by independent investment management firms (or money managers). Varying fee structures characterise the sector.</p>
<p>Separate accounts tend to be highly diversified and have a particular focus. However, unlike mutual funds the separate account portfolio manager buys individual stocks for his client’s account and not for a general fund. A corporate treasurer investing in a separate account will not be buying into a pool of assets, but will be buying – and owning – the individual assets.</p>
<div class="boxed">
<h3 id="mmf-regulation">MMF regulation</h3>
<p>Money market funds hit their peak of popularity in January 2009, when total investments were estimated at $3.92 trillion. Enthusiasm has since cooled for this sector, with funds invested now estimated to be worth $2.6 trillion. It could cool further still as financial regulators seek to strengthen investor protection by increasing regulatory oversight of money market funds.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission in the US laid out its plans in June 2013, which included a provision to require prime funds used by institutional investors to move to a floating net asset value (NAV) – at present shares are valued at $1 each. A second proposal would give fund boards for institutional and retail funds the authority to impose liquidity fees and redemption gates during times of stress. That would give funds the power to stop an outflow of investor money. European financial regulators are also tackling MMF regulation and in September 2013, the European Commission proposed a European framework designed for MMFs. But the final picture for regulation of MMFs is yet to emerge.</p>
<p>Interestingly, several recent surveys have found that total corporate assets in money market funds would fall by circa 60% if a floating NAV were introduced. Separate accounts are a likely beneficiary of such outflows.</p>
</div>
<p>Separately managed accounts can play an important role in a corporate treasurer’s short-term cash strategy because of the special benefits they offer, albeit at higher investment minimums. Because treasurers can customise these funds, individual financial goals can be better matched than in, say, a MMF. The features of professional money management are combined with the flexibility, control and transparency of owning individual securities.</p>
<p>In summary, a separately managed account is a portfolio of securities directly owned by the investor and managed according to specific parameters and/or style by a professional investment manager. Account owners have the ability to customise their accounts by excluding certain securities or industries.</p>
<p>While separate accounts have been popular in the US for the past 20 years, Jason Straker, Managing Director and Client Portfolio Manager for the short-term fixed income group at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, says a better understanding of the short-term markets among European treasurers and corporations is boosting interest in them in Europe at the moment.</p>
<p>“The credit crisis proved to be a lesson for many treasurers when it came to money market funds, which they had previously treated as a commodity,” says Straker. “Now treasurers are asking more questions of the securities in which they invest.” This greater understanding has led to an increase in the popularity of separate accounts. “One of the biggest benefits of separately managed accounts is customisation; we and other providers can offer a corporate treasurer complete customisation of the portfolio.”</p>

<p class="source">Source: Cerulli Associates Managed Account Research Quarterly Summary. As of 31<sup>st</sup> December 2012.</p>
</figure>
<p>Says Aviva’s Cookson: “A treasurer can be very specific about the underwriting criteria used for the investments in a separate account, whereas in a MMF there is no direct control of the underwriting. A separate account’s underwriting criteria can match the treasurer’s risk/return objectives. For example, if you don’t need some cash for six months, the duration of the separate account can be tailored to meet that expectation.” They also offer greater transparency into the underlying assets in the fund, with more detailed reporting than is available with MMFs.</p>
<p>This customisation comes at a price; separate accounts are more complex to set up than MMFs and require lengthy discussion with investment managers about specific goals and requirements. Documentation and legal work is extensive and in addition to appointing a fund manager to undertake the fiduciary responsibilities of the fund, a corporate also has to appoint a custodian to safeguard the assets. Extensive due diligence of the fund manager and the custodian must be undertaken.</p>
<p>The treasurer will need to understand the risk/reward profile of all the instruments that the fund manager will invest into. He or she will also need to quiz the fund manager on their expertise; how long the manager has been managing separate account mandates; its track record and philosophy of investing cash; and how core separate accounts are to its overall activities.</p>
<h3 id="flexibility">Flexibility</h3>
<p>Another benefit of using separate accounts is a greater potential to target higher returns or yield versus other off the shelf investments such as MMFs or bank deposits. MMFs are extremely liquid, but that liquidity comes at a cost, as between 20-40% can be held in overnight deposits. Some corporate treasurers question whether keeping large sums in overnight monies is a missed opportunity. With separate accounts, all of the liquidity belongs to the corporate and therefore the overnight proportion of liquidity can be reduced as required to suit the corporate’s cash requirements.</p>
<p>Flexibility is also apparent when it comes to the assets that make up a portfolio. A corporate’s individual view on investment types can be more accurately reflected in a separate account than in, say a MMF. For example, some companies are happy to invest in BBB-rated issuers, but MMFs do not allow such assets to be included in their portfolios. Straker points out that with credit ratings falling across the board, there are some very good BBB-rated issuers, particularly in the manufacturing and energy sectors.</p>
<p>By investing short-term cash into a separate account, a corporate treasurer can therefore gain greater diversification in their risk exposure. Because individual securities are owned by the corporate, there is full transparency of the portfolio of investments. This means that a corporate has more control in managing all of its investments and can ensure there are no overlaps.</p>
<p>Additionally, separate accounts enable positions to be exited very quickly. If the portfolio manager believes the market is due for a correction or wishes to exit a particular position, the necessary trade can be executed rapidly. Also, if investment circumstances change, for example if an acquisition or bond maturity is in the pipeline, the average maturity of the separate account can be changed to ensure the liquidity is available when required.</p>
<h3 id="suitability">Suitability</h3>
<p>While separate accounts have many benefits, they will not be suitable for all corporates. There is disagreement about the minimum investment required, however. Straker says companies turning to separate accounts tend to be in the very cash-rich sectors such as pharmaceuticals and technology. “Separate accounts aren’t suitable for companies whose cash balances fluctuate to a great extent. For example if a company has cash balances that go from 0 to 50 (million dollars) at any time, that level of uncertainty would mean it is unlikely you could invest in, and sell, securities very quickly. You’d be better off looking at a MMF.” Companies that can earmark a stable cash balance of around $50m or more should consider separate accounts.</p>
<p>Cookson disagrees, saying $50m is a ‘relatively small mandate’ for fund managers. The smaller the mandate, the less scope and flexibility there is for yield to be generated. “I believe a more realistic minimum balance for a separate account investment is about $100m. But the main question for a corporate treasurer is ‘do I have sufficient cash to use this approach?’.”</p>
<p>“We find many of our customers often link their liquidity and segregated accounts, using both elements to manage the different layers of cash,” says Cookson. “Balances in working capital and separate accounts can be linked and funds moved between the two as needed.”</p>
<p>Another advantage of separate accounts is that they enable corporates to generate yields better than those achievable in MMFs or bank deposits without having to employ internal resources to do so. Few corporates are in the position to be able to employ teams of credit analysts to manage cash. By choosing separate accounts, a corporate is outsourcing its credit process to an investment management company. The investment manager will use its expertise and understanding of markets to maintain the performance of the separate account portfolio. Corporates should choose managers they believe have good credit processes and sound underlying investment practices. This is why the due diligence process is so important.</p>
<h3 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h3>
<p>As separate accounts become more popular, they will not be suitable for every corporate treasurer. The cash invested in separate accounts should be sourced from reserves that are not required on a daily basis (such as working capital balances). Rather, the funds should be those that can be spared for a year or more. Other options for investing cash include bank term deposits of one month or greater. These are very simple investments to set up, but there is a significant counterparty risk of placing unsecured funds with a single counterparty.</p>
<p>Exchange traded funds are also becoming more popular for corporate treasurers, although their growth in Europe is not matching that of separate accounts. These funds tend to be used by extremely large corporates in combination with their cash investments. However, knowledge and experience in trading securities on stock exchanges is a prerequisite.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Seeing your company’s name splashed across the front pages is enough to give any employee that terrible sinking feeling. This is even truer for corporate treasurers as their job is not only about cash management and working capital, but also about integrity and personal character.</p>
<p>In this regard, contrary to popular belief, not all publicity is good publicity. Negative exposure can have a ruinous effect on a company’s market standing, credit ratings, bank relationships and investor relations, as well as the ability to attract and retain talent. “Ultimately, diminished reputational value, or ‘soft’ capital, could impact a company’s long-term competitive advantage,” says Rey Sermonia, who previously held the Treasurer position at Qatargas.</p>
<p>Reputation is an important consideration for many directors. Two-thirds (66%) of directors on the Boards of more than 190 public and privately held companies surveyed by the accounting firm EisnerAmper say reputational risk remains their biggest non-financial concern.</p>
<p>However, protecting your company’s brand can seem a bit like fighting fires on all sides. All other risks contribute to a corporate’s reputation, including market risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, foreign exchange (FX) risk, financial crime and compliance, and operational risk. For example, BP’s operational blunder, which caused the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, resulted in the biggest criminal fine in US history as part of a $4.5 billion settlement. The financial cost is compounded by reputational harm associated with criminal charges and an environmental catastrophe, something which will be remembered for generations.</p>
<p>Paul Stheeman, ex-Director of International Treasury at Petro-Canada turned Treasury Consultant, says: “The reputational damage was huge, partly because the disaster hit BP alone and none of its peers. Shareholders are now more demanding as to what can and should be managed by a corporate.”</p>
<p>“Today there are many ongoing enquiries and high-profile investigations into wrong-doings,” adds Gary Williams, General Manager Treasury, Mitsubishi Corporation International (Europe). “The affected parties are more likely to seek settlement through the legal system and these cases are well publicised.”</p>
<p>Although the most significant contributing factors may differ depending on industry, reputation risk is common across all sectors. Stheeman comes to the crux of the matter when he says the biggest risks facing a corporate’s reputation today are those which reflect a lack of internal controls.</p>
<h3 id="fraud-and-financial-crime-a-question-of-integrity">Fraud and financial crime: a question of integrity</h3>
<p>Eddie McLaughlin, a Managing Director at Marsh Risk Consulting, believes that key reputation exposures facing corporates are around the fidelity of staff and social and ethical responsibility. This is certainly true for the financial services (FS) industry, which has come under severe scrutiny post-financial crisis, resulting in public trust in the banking industry reaching an all-time low.</p>
<p>The banking industry’s standing has been further impaired by a number of high-profile insider trading and fraud cases, such as the UBS rogue trader Kweku Adoboli, who was jailed in November for racking up losses of over £1.5 billion during three years of secretive, off-the-books trades. Billed as the ‘UK’s biggest fraud’, Adoboli was allowed to move from a back office role to the exchange traded futures desk, a move normally seen as a breach of best practice. His public prosecution exposed UBS’ internal compliance lapses for all to see and may lead to more regulation for the industry as a whole.</p>
<p>While banks have dominated headlines in recent months, well-known corporate brands have also taken reputational hits due to fraud and criminal misconduct. Recently, Hewlett-Packard (HP) revealed it had to write-down $8.8 billion after “serious accounting improprieties” were discovered at Autonomy, the British tech firm it acquired in 2011 for more than $10 billion. HP reported a net loss of $6.9 billion, effectively wiping out its profits for the last quarter. Despite assuring the public that it would attempt to recoup shareholder money through the civil courts, the damage was done and HP shares plunged 13% by mid-morning after the announcement. This example shows how quickly a blow to reputation can affect a corporate’s standing in the market and its bottom line.</p>
<p>Today corporates have to stay abreast of a slew of new domestic and international regulations. The world has come a long way since Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) in 2002, which was a response to the accounting scandals involving Enron, Peregrine Systems and Worldcom, among others.</p>
<p>Notably, more companies are adopting risk mitigation and compliance measures when it comes to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the UK Bribery Act, according to a recent survey by Kroll Advisory Solutions. In 2011 only 26% of survey respondents said they had put bribery risk monitoring and reporting systems in place. This year, that figure increased to 52% of respondents. Likewise, where 29% of companies said they trained employees and vendors on anti-bribery compliance in 2011, 55% said they had done so in 2012.</p>
<p>However, more than one in five of survey respondents said that “although they are subject to the UK Bribery Act or US FCPA, they have not made a thorough risk assessment, trained the right people, or amended their due diligence process.” This is a worrying lack of oversight and may lead to hefty fines, as well as headline news.</p>
<p>Fraud and financial crime are clearly areas under the treasurer’s remit. To help mitigate these risks, Mitsubishi’s Williams advises treasury to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Have a well-constructed treasury policy and procedures in place, including payment and dealing limits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regardless of the size of the team, have some level of segregation between tasks, particularly in the payment and reconciliation processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perform regular reconciliation of derivative hedge positions to underlying exposures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a regular independent review by the audit or internal control department.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="market-liquidity-and-credit-risk">Market, liquidity and credit risk</h3>
<p>The spectacular failure of Facebook’s initial public offering (IPO), which led to the company losing more than $50 billion in market value (40%) in 90 days, as well as Zynga and Groupon which dropped more than 75% since going public, called in question their business fundamentals and strategy. These companies quickly went from leading lights to laughing stocks in the marketplace. The exposure has also made many other companies skittish about directly tapping the market for funds.</p>
<p>But funding remains an issue for many corporates. Earlier this year, debt-laden directories group Yell dropped around 18% after warning on outlook and banking covenants, and was forced to rebrand as hibu. Many other retail brands have faced similar credit and cash flow problems, such as Comet, Ocado, Hostess and Premier Foods, to name just a few. Experiencing a liquidity crunch meant that these companies have had to slash jobs, shut shops, pull out of non-core markets and go through debt and cost restructuring programmes in order to preserve investor and market confidence – all of which make headline news.</p>
<p>In order to maintain a level of confidence in the business, treasury needs to develop clear, effective lines of communication to its banks, investors, rating agencies and suppliers, in addition to the company’s internal stakeholders, advises Sermonia.</p>
<p>An Assistant Group Treasurer at a large travel and leisure group believes that being adequately funded is the most important reputation risk from a treasury perspective. “Any indication that you might breach banking covenants in the current climate triggers a press reaction. This is particularly true if you are a consumer brand and employ a large number of people, as the press interest might go further than just the financial pages.</p>
<p>“The ongoing worldwide recession has made trading conditions hard, squeezing revenues, and the step change to the banking world has added to the pressure on cash flow, as the cost of servicing debt increased,” she adds.</p>
<p>The Assistant Treasurer suggests pushing for additional headroom in facilities, and focusing on working capital and cash management to improve cash flow. Growing revenues is quite difficult in this economic environment, so treasurers need to lead the way in encouraging a cash culture within their organisations. “There is also a role for innovative banks to develop new products to help with both the working capital and cash management and also ways of reducing the needs for credit lines, for example by using insurance rather than indemnification for chargeback risk,” she adds.</p>
<p>In a new development, UK high street names – for example Tesco, John Lewis and National Grid – have gone down the route of corporate bonds aimed at retail investors. The expansion is driven by a retreat in UK banks’ lending, which has pushed companies that are not large enough to access institutional public bond markets to look for alternative funding resources. However, already some concerns are being raised that retail investors may not fully understand the potential losses they could be exposed to – which could, in turn, result in a negative backlash for the brands and their banks.</p>
<h3 id="supply-chain-stress">Supply chain stress</h3>
<p>The sluggish global economy has put a lot of pressure on the financial strength of suppliers. By rationalising their supply chains during the recession, many companies have become more reliant on fewer suppliers and opened themselves up to severe supply chain risk, not only from supplier distress but also natural disasters and other types of business disruptions.</p>
<p>According to the January 2012 Association for Financial Professionals (AFP) Risk Survey, in collaboration with Oliver Wyman Group’s Global Risk Centre, 57% of organisations that view business and operations risks as a major concern identify supply chain disruptions as having the potential for either a “significant” or “very significant” impact on earnings over the next three years. But it is not just earnings that will take a hit if a company can’t deliver products to its customers – the market reputation will also come under strain.</p>
<p>Peter Robertshaw, Senior Vice President of Communications, Active Risk, explains how one large manufacturer discovered that it was reliant on a major supplier that would halt the company in its tracks if it was to stop manufacturing. To develop a dual source, the company built its own factory and started producing the part itself.</p>
<p>Mustafa Kilic, until recently the Regional Treasurer and Group Insurance Manager, Group Treasury, Indesit, tells a similar story. In 2009, the home appliances manufacturer decided to embark on a risk audit that also took into account potential future risks. It identified a Japanese manufacturer that was the sole supplier of a critical refrigerator part. In order to mitigate future risk, Indesit sourced a second supplier in Latin America. As a result, when the Japanese earthquake and tsunami hit in 2011 and closed down the original supplier, Indesit was able to protect its business reputation with advance planning. This is in stark contrast to some companies which didn’t know that they had exposure until their supply chain had been interrupted.</p>
<p>Kilic believes that business continuity risk is the biggest threat to reputation and promotes the concept of key risk indicators (KRIs). In a similar vein to key performance indicators (KPIs), Kilic explains that KRIs are “triggering items” hidden under the radar that could have a profound effect on the business. These risks are interdependent and could result in a domino effect.</p>
<p>Looking for connections between risks is a developing trend, according to Robertshaw. “Typically in the past the Board would have been presented with a top ten risk list,” he says, “but what that was doing was creating a false sense of security. Now people are trying to go beyond the top ten and examine smaller risks that deserve to be looked at because they are highly connected.”</p>
<p>He goes back to the BP oil spill, which was a result of several things coming together to “create the perfect storm”. “BP is a good example – people are monitoring things at an operational level unconnected to the strategic level, which understands that it can ill afford a conflict with the US government because that will lead to its operating licence being taken away. This is a strategic risk but the operational people wouldn’t have seen it,” he says.</p>
<h3 id="the-treasurers-role">The treasurer’s role</h3>
<p>Stheeman believes that treasury is a natural function to have responsibility for enterprise risk management, including reputation risk. “Creating awareness at all levels and ensuring appropriate policies and procedures are in place, as well as having sustainable plans in how to deal with an event leading to reputational damage, are essential,” he says.</p>
<p>Marsh’s McLaughlin is not fully convinced that the treasurer is the best-placed person, which he believes should be a dedicated chief risk officer (CRO). However, the debate continues as to whether having a CRO allows employees to relinquish responsibility for risk. McLaughlin argues that it depends on how it is executed. “The CRO should have a mantra stapled on the wall which says ‘it is not my responsibility to manage risk in this organisation, it is yours’. The CRO is a risk coordinator – they are not responsible for every risk in the organisation,” he says.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The final component is making sure that there is a cross-discipline group for crisis and enterprise risk management to develop action plans for safeguarding the company’s reputation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All agree that developing an enterprise-wide response plan that can immediately be put into action is a critical component to managing risk. Robertshaw recounts how when HSBC’s ATM network went down in May, the bank immediately responded to complaints on Twitter, by first apologising and then providing progress reports until the systems were up and running again. “Social media commentators then tweeted positively about HSBC’s response. Even if something bad happens, you can enhance your reputation if you respond in the right way,” he says, but warns that social media, because of its ubiquity and speed, has the power to destroy corporate reputation in seconds. Robertshaw believes that executive Boards are lagging behind in understanding the power of social media.</p>
<p>McLaughlin’s advice to corporates is to put in place mechanisms for tracking reputational risks across the enterprise and have a separate reputational risk register to understand the kinds of risk that would undermine the company’s reputation. “Part of that is assessing your company’s reputational capital and emotional quotient with clients, because this will help to classify your sensitivity to brand risk,” he says. The final component is making sure that there is a cross-discipline group for crisis and enterprise risk management to develop action plans for safeguarding the company’s reputation.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p><em>Corporate treasurers face an array of financial market challenges today, including interest rate, foreign exchange, commodity and inflation risk. How companies cope with these risks depends on the extent to which they adopt a comprehensive risk evaluation strategy. In this Product Profile, we speak to Jwan Mella, Director, Financial Risk Advisory – Capital Markets at Lloyds Bank, about his team’s process for assessing – and minimising – the impact of financial market volatility on a company’s bottom line.</em></p>
<p>When a company uses any form of financing, there is an inherent risk that it will not have sufficient cash flow to meet its financial obligations at a given point in time. This may happen for a variety of reasons but the most common financial threats are market-related.</p>
<p>Take interest rate risk for example. In the long term, interest rates are likely to increase from the current low levels. For a company that is a net borrower, the single largest interest rate risk will be the servicing of debt. An increase in interest rates (however large) would likely mean higher interest payments and repayment costs. If, on the other hand, a company is cash rich, it can be exposed to the risk that interest rates will decrease and impact the size of the yield on its investments, as we are seeing currently.</p>
<p>In either case, interest rate exposure constitutes the danger of reduced cash flow, whether in the form of diminished cash inflows or increased cash outflows. Therefore, the main danger resulting from interest rate risk is that a company could face liquidity problems. In the worst case scenario, loan covenants such as minimum interest cover ratios could be triggered by rising interest rates, which in turn could translate into higher borrowing costs as a result of financial distress.</p>
<p>Also, it is often assumed that fixed rate financing does not carry any risks from interest rate changes. However, while fixed rate debt might provide the security of certain repayment rates, a fall in interest rates would result in opportunity losses because the company cannot benefit from improving interest rates.</p>
<p>But with so much to contend with on a daily basis and staffing levels only decreasing, how can treasurers find the time to properly answer niggling questions such as, ‘Will the company be able to readjust to paying more for its borrowings when rates begin to rise again? Would it be wise to shift from floating to fixed costs or vice versa?’ This is where Lloyds Bank’s Financial Risk Advisory team comes in.</p>

<p>“We work alongside our clients to help them to assess the impact of financial market volatility on their bottom line profit and key performance metrics. One of the tools we use to do this, within our comprehensive financial risk framework, is the financial risk evaluation process. Essentially, this is a customisable series of models which combine a company’s financial projections with financial market uncertainty,” explains Jwan Mella, Director, Financial Risk Advisory – Capital Markets at Lloyds Bank.</p>
<p>The models are used to look at strategy optimisation (by providing feedback on a company’s debt structure, for example), as well as concerns such as refinancing risk or the cost impact of a change in strategy, such as mark-to-market crystallisation. “In other words, the risk evaluation process sits between a rudimentary analysis of a company’s risks and a wider financial risk analysis encompassing the impact of any foreseeable financial risks.”</p>
<h4 id="putting-the-process-into-action">Putting the process into action</h4>
<p>Typically, the process of creating a financial risk report for the client begins with an initial meeting in which the client and the bank discuss the Financial Risk Advisory team’s approach, as well as the model itself and what is required. Says Mella: “We engage with stakeholders at the strategic level and extract the driving factors for a company’s financial risks. These risks, in many cases, are implicit and not obvious from the outset.”</p>
<p>“Once we have determined that our process is the right approach for the client’s needs, we work closely with them to run the simulations, based on the market factors we have agreed, and in looking at their business strategy.” To do this, the client is required to provide a certain level of company information. For a base level analysis, for example, the following information will be required: historic financial information going back at least five years (or an established record of how a company will perform relative to financial markets); income statement projection; cash flow statement projection; balance sheet projection; debt and refinancing projections; current debt structure; any mark-to-market or existing derivatives contracts.</p>
<h4 id="next-steps">Next steps</h4>
<p>Once the data has been assembled, the starting point is to look at the company’s cash flows, balance sheet and their strategic horizon. “We also look at the company’s cash or funding levels, as well as their debt structure and how those progress over time. This takes into account the company’s own assumptions about their refinancing needs and overlays financial risks, such as the fact that the company’s revenues may be partially linked to inflation for example.”</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote>Take a property company for example. We would look at property indices and layer them into a Monte Carlo simulation. Then we stress the revenue – we do this largely through historic information and back testing revenue movements according to stress levels. We can look to pin down the significance of the correlation first of all and then we look at how persistent the effect is, or whether there is a lag.</blockquote>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Mella continues: “Take a property company for example. We would look at property indices and layer them into a Monte Carlo simulation. Then we stress the revenue – we do this largely through historic information and back testing revenue movements according to stress levels. We can look to pin down the significance of the correlation first of all and then we look at how persistent the effect is, or whether there is a lag.”</p>
<p>“We can also assess whether the revenues are correlated to specific movements in a certain commodity. This can then help the company to make sure its pricing structure is correct, so that it can absorb any increases in the price of that commodity.” Other metrics that are stress tested include: operating expense, net interest expense, EBITDA, leverage and interest cover. The results are then represented graphically:</p>

<a class="enlargeable" href="http://treasurytoday.com/i/2012/08/2012-07and08-07-pp-chart-1-interest-cover-ratio.png"><img alt="Chart 1: Interest Cover Ratio" height="215" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/2012/08/2012-07and08-07-pp-chart-1-interest-cover-ratio-t.png" width="300"/></a>
<p class="source">Source: Lloyds Bank</p>
</figure>
<p>What the interest cover ratio distribution in the chart shows is that there is a high probability that the company in question will be able to fund operations over the strategic ten year horizon.</p>
<p>However, there is a small chance that the interest cover ratio approaches 1.0x over the horizon.</p>
<p>Once the relevant risk metrics for the company have been assessed, we then look at performance measures and risk tolerances. What are the limits the company wants to work to and what are the worst case scenarios it will tolerate? “Setting the risk tolerances is extremely important and there are a number of points that companies often overlook.</p>
<p>These include benchmarking against the correct peer group; taking into account covenant headroom; and assessing the overall viability of the business strategy” says Mella. Lloyds Bank can then overlay that onto the company’s balance sheet and income statement for example and show what those performance limits would mean in real terms for the company’s bottom line.</p>

</figure>
<p>The next step in the process is to determine the best debt structure for the company. What is the optimal level of fixed/floating debt for example? In situations where the results from the analysis are straightforward, a decision making/strategy comparison grid can be produced (<a href="#table-1-comparison-grid">see table 1</a>).</p>
<p>The overall aim of this process is to move the client towards a strategic risk management approach. Strategic risk management is designed to: identify the risks that could impede or stop normal business operations; highlight the extremes of market volatility and how they affect the bottom line performance of the business; suggest an optimal capital structure and hedging benchmark to mitigate or remove the risks to which the business is exposed; when the financial market exposure is varied, complex or partially offset, an optimisation across different metrics is required.</p>
<h4 id="optimisation">Optimisation</h4>
<p>Once the appropriate strategy has been determined, it is time for optimisation to begin. This involves another charting exercise, called ‘optimal frontier analysis’.</p>
<p>What charts 2 and 3 show, says Mella, is that “in this example, by the nature of the business there is a strong link to inflation, where assets, and in turn income have a large inflation component. The company’s inflation risk is partly mitigated by implicit and explicit inflation linked components in the operating expense. However, as the optimal frontier shows, on average, over a ten year period, the company can benefit from having up to 20% of the debt linked to inflation. Additionally, 10% floating linked debt lowers the interest rate worst case profile.”</p>
<p>Each blue point represents a different proportion of fixed, floating and inflation linked debt. </p>

<p>“Floating rate debt in the very short term offers cost savings, but over the strategic horizon can introduce high volatility around key metrics. A highly fixed debt structure offers funding cost certainty, but no natural synergy with the business. It is also worth noting that mark-to-market of fixed rate debt is included when switching to inflation and floating.”</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>The same ‘optimal frontier analysis’ is then conducted on other key metrics, such as cash levels and earnings. To converge onto an optimal fixed – floating – inflation debt mix, the opportunities and the risks are then explored together. The opportunities include: lowering funding costs; aligning debt structure with asset and income structure; and flexibility. The risks include: the maintenance of key ratios and funding cost volatility.</p>
<h4 id="strategy-validation">Strategy validation</h4>
<p>The final step in the process is to validate the strategy. For example, charts 4 and 5 illustrate that under the base scenario the company is expected not to be cash generative in the short to medium term. The expected cash levels are below zero over most of the strategic horizon. By moving more of its debt to be inflation-linked however, the company can skew the distribution higher to limit any downside moves in cash.</p>
<p>As such, the optimisation is validated since “increasing the level of floating rate debt and including some inflation linked debt raises the expected cash levels and narrows the uncertainty around the distribution.”</p>

<p>“Often clients come to us as they are looking for analysis to take to their Board. Through the process and the team’s expertise, what Lloyds Bank offers is an extra layer of granularity over a company’s exposures and optimal strategies. The findings of our modelling might, for example, give the treasurer the ‘ammunition’ they need to have a discussion around amending the company’s hedging strategy – or indeed they might confirm that what the company is currently doing to manage and mitigate its financial risk is sufficient,” he continues.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>According to Mella, the model is applicable to all corporates. For smaller corporates, the bank might simply look at their debt profile, or a specific scenario. For the larger, highly sophisticated clients, there is the ability to dig much deeper – the client might have an obscure risk measure it wishes to use or, of course the company might want the whole picture of its risks analysed in order to outline the optimal risk management strategy.</p>
<p>As Mella’s team touches on every product area, they take a joined up approach to looking at a company’s funding strategy, with products to back up the findings of their risk evaluation. This includes everything from derivative products to debt structure. The team also frequently undertakes follow-up projects that stem from the initial work produced for the client.</p>
<p>“We might update previous analysis with new market information for example, or the company might have internal or external advisory capabilities with which they want our process integrated. Typically, our strategic evaluation work is 100% bespoke. Our aim is to always provide tailored, in-depth intelligence to the client to assist them in creating a long-term financial risk management strategy.”</p>
