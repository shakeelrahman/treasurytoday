<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Elms, shares “Our clients business models are evolving at pace, and as such continue to see more and more interconnectedness across industries. New consumers, new supply chains, new entrants are opening up and transforming the ecosystems in which our clients operate. As a truly global bank, Citi has a unique ability to advance the connectivity across these networks through end-to-end solutions across the value chains”. The ecosystems that are witnessing these transforming business models and digital disruption are behind our focus. Healthcare, Consumer &amp; Wellness is one such high growth client ecosystem or supergroup.</p>
<p>In his new global role taking on responsibility for one of Citi’s new ‘supergroup’ sector combinations, Gupta shines a spotlight on the evolution of the healthcare, consumer and wellness [HCW] segments. Gupta is leading one new global super group sector for TTS that Citi has been integrated into their business model.</p>
<p>We hear about Gupta’s new HCW priorities, the bank’s work with their clients and their attention to new business models in our new, fast-paced, increasingly digital world.</p>
<p>There is a blurring of lines between industries within the technology, healthcare and consumer spaces. Gupta illustrates this, “For example, if you look at the consumer space, more and more consumer products are being sold online, from Nike shoes all the way to Nespresso, proving that digital commerce in consumer businesses is a game changer.  There is a convergence of technology platforms and a huge convergence within healthcare and tech, as whichever part of the world you are in, you can access healthcare virtually.  Doctors are the same, the medicines and the treatments are probably evolving but are still the same and yet the interaction is happening on a technology platform now, even within the healthcare space and the focus of tech in healthcare is a key mission.”</p>
<p>From healthcare, to consumer, we moved on to the third pillar of Gupta’s new supergroup which is wellness. So, what do we mean when we speak about wellness? This catch-all industry title encompasses an enormous amount of economic activity. Gupta outlines Citi’s approach to this industry sector, “Firstly, people are looking for protein alternatives, people are looking to have less of a carbon footprint, so this area of food and wellness falls closer to the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) space. Secondly, this space is really about healthy living, about our well-being, about how conscious you are in your own body and self”.</p>
<p>“This convergence and connectivity is really informing us that we need to run these segments collectively rather than independently. Think pre-pandemic, people were looking at cure and prevention separately. So, if someone has a disease and wants to access a cure, somebody who is more health conscious will look for prevention. At Citi, we are focusing on growth segments which are global and are intrinsically inter-connected, with global supply chains attached to that convergence of prevention and cure.</p>
<h4 id=""evolving-business-models"">Evolving business models</h4>
<p>In practice Gupta explains, “Clients are organising themselves as one platform. So the platform is the same, the client is actually offering a wellness product which is an organic, plant-based protein. This is also helping the consumer arm, because then you eat healthier. That then branches into healthcare, which could be about tracking if a person is eating less meat-based protein, more plant-based, what is their diabetic sugar level, what is their glucose level, what is the electrocardiogram (ECG) reading giving rise to new ecosystems?  Now a question for us is, ‘was this ecosystem there five or ten years ago?’ I think the answer is, it was always there. This has indeed evolved and the pace of disruption has accelerated with lines being blurred that made it seem there was never any interaction between them.”</p>
<p>Another big trend in our industry is the pace of metaverse adoption. The metaverse in the future of retail is anticipated to drive digital commerce and increase the flow of consumer goods. One is consumer brands selling non-fungible tokens (NFT) tokens and the other is healthcare, where you will have your digital twin (a digital version of yourself) and for example, while you are on a flight it would track what's happening to your metabolism, your skin texture and your posture. That data can determine what cosmetics are being offered and sold by the large cosmetic companies of this world, so I know I’m talking a little futuristically, but the future is very much here and now to a large extent. We see this as the future of retail.”</p>
<h4 id=""impact-of-the-pandemic"">Impact of the pandemic</h4>
<p>As Gupta sees it, the main evolution is from niche businesses to sustainable large-scale businesses.  “Let’s take the advent of Athleisure, which is a new business line of clothes, where people can mix work and play. It was very niche and it was not something which would become a critical mass in five to ten years.” Essentially, the pandemic created the perfect environment for this sector to grow, both in the moment when people were working from home and needing apparel to take them on that hybrid journey, and into the future where business attire and leisure attire have merged, with no trace of separation.</p>
<p>Gupta continues with another example, “The other side of the story, which we probably should consider is, will some of this acceleration slow down, given everybody is now travelling? In my view, there will be a consolidation in the market, that's how progress happens. Clearly the pandemic has been the catalyst to get to that scale superfast, it would have never happened otherwise and would have taken another decade or so.”</p>
<h4 id=""future-focused"">Future focused</h4>
<p>As he takes up the mantle of this newly created global position, Gupta shares his ambitions for Citi’s clients, “Our ambition is simple yet may seem very bold. What I want to do in this role is to put our clients’ transformation at the centre of our own transformation.” Citi’s differentiator in the market has focused on its mutual evolution alongside its clients. As clients moved their treasuries to build shared service centres which became global or started procurement efficiencies, they have in turn, evolved. They will continue in this vein says Gupta, “Over the next few years, we want to be in line with the commercial organisations.  In order to do this, we have to build our armoury of solutions and within the next year, we will be investing around one billion dollars in our technology budget<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup>. Secondly, we aim to transform with the clients’ commercial organisation because that’s where most changes are happening.”</p>
<p>The banking industry goes through a process of changes around every three to five years as Gupta sees it and he is excited to face this transformational challenge.  Digital transformation continues to sweep across the banking and payments industry. Innovative thought leadership partnerships complemented with our global network have enabled a sustained digital client engagement providing clients with new, fresh insights and to accompany them on their global growth journeys. Solution differentiators include Citi global instant payments that is available in over 60 countries, allowing clients to access the solution via a single API; cross-border payments into digital wallets which offers clients in over 100 countries near-instant deliver of funds and the Sustainable Trade and Working Capital Loans solution available to clients in 80 countries.</p>
<p>As he puts it, when it comes to industry changes, “Rather than be disrupted, we disrupt together with it.” With this transformation comes an evolution in the kind of talent that Citi is hiring into these new supergroups both internally and externally, says Gupta, ‘We need catalysts internally and externally. I’m a perfect example in that I’ve been hired to do this job internally, but we also added to our bench strength from across our Institutional Clients Group (ICG) franchise with colleagues experienced in covering healthcare, consumer, and wellness groups, from senior MDs to directors, across all levels. These people have just come on board and our activity levels are increasing in pace.”</p>
<h4 id=""challenging-the-status-quo"">Challenging the status quo</h4>
<p>As Citi challenges its norms across the board, one of the things they are focusing on within the healthcare, consumer and wellness supergroup is to work with fintechs who are operating within these spaces. As this collaborative energy combines with a new wave of talent and of mindsets coming together, it is something of a landmark moment for the global bank. As Gupta says, “I feel confident that together we are on the right track, and we have to stay laser focused on our execution for the foreseeable future.”</p>
<h4 id=""a-new-era"">A new era</h4>
<p>There is an enormous amount of energy around this new era for Citi. As Gupta describes it, “It's like a relay race. A commercial banker onboards new names at a nascent stage of the evolution of a client and the TTS journey starts here. They mature and go to the corporate banker. In TTS, we're organising ourselves horizontally, covering commercial banking and corporate banking. The biggest change today is that we are focused on taking care of a healthcare technology client as they evolve from a commercial to a large corporate client of ours. As they grow as a corporate, the TTS platform that we offer remains the same, so the client doesn't feel that there are changes, it is just that their scale is growing.  This evolution is what I call the ‘horizontal part’ of TTS.  This cuts across both commercial and corporate and is the business evolution journey. I believe the continuity of that client relationship has a lot of value because that builds confidence and the long-lasting relationships.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Market data from PwC suggests 2021 was a record-breaking year for M&amp;A, with the number of deals completed globally rising by almost a quarter (24%) compared to 2020 and deal value increasing by 57% over the same period. One of the main factors behind this growth was portfolio reviews triggering a wave of divestitures across industries as corporate dealmakers seek to reinvest and optimise their assets.</p>
<p>According to PwC, private equity firms were sitting on a record US$2.3trn of capital that was committed to investment but not yet allocated by the end of last year.</p>
<p>Refinitiv reports that between January and March 2022, worldwide M&amp;A activity pushed past US$1trn for the seventh consecutive quarter despite rising geopolitical tensions that are prompting corporate decision makers to consider a ‘pause’.</p>
<p>So although higher interest rates, rising inflation, increased taxes and greater regulation could pose structural or financial hurdles for completing deals in 2022, there are likely to be plenty more major deals done over the coming months.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for treasury teams? Damian Glendinning is Chairman of the advisory board at treasury intelligence firm CompleXCountries, which hosts confidential peer discussions where subject matter experts share their approaches to a specific complex treasury problem.</p>
<p>During a call with a member whose company was in the midst of a significant acquisition and wished to benchmark its approach, the difficulty in obtaining information on the acquired entity before the deal closes was highlighted as a consistent challenge that made it difficult to operate effectively from day one.</p>
<p>Suggested solutions included:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Finding out whether the target entity uses any of the same banks as the acquirer (who may be concerned about potential loss of business).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reminding management and HR that payroll cannot be paid unless a banking structure is in place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Negotiating with the selling entity for it to continue cash management operations for a period after the deal has closed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Glendinning notes that participants on the call referred to the importance of clarity on the tax structure and business model as well as IT systems – for example, determining whether the acquired entity will be moved onto the group ERP system. They also suggested that it was not unheard of for acquired treasury teams to overstate legal and regulatory issues relating to sharing of data to avoid being centralised.</p>
<p>Rhonda Kruman (a consultant in the corporate treasury consulting group for commercial banking at J.P. Morgan who focuses on providing treasury management expertise to clients executing mergers and acquisitions) identifies consolidating online banking portals as an important aspect of integration with a focus on streamlining account visibility and reducing costs.</p>
<p>She recognises that not every company requires full integration of its treasury, payables and receivables processes in its post-acquisition structure and that there may be strategic reasons for keeping functions separate.</p>


<blockquote><p>Treasury’s remit should be defined clearly to understand which activities need to be assessed and how to structure the roles and responsibilities within the new treasury organisation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">Sander de Vries, Director of Treasury, Zanders</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Kruman also recommends leveraging banking partners who can offer useful insight into implementation timeframes and functions and provide a treasury point of view to help address considerations of all impacted parties.</p>
<p>“The most important factors to consider when merging or integrating treasury departments are the ‘big four’ elements that comprise treasury and its operations – policy, process, people and banking,” says Adrian Rodgers, Director of treasury consultancy ARC Solutions.</p>
<p>Policies require urgent review and approval by executive management to ensure that they are fit for purpose for the new, merged organisation and reflect its concerns and objectives while processes need to be tailored or re-engineered to ensure they actually reflect and deliver on policy objectives.</p>


<h2 class=""h3 copy__heading"">Case study</h2>
<p><img alt=""Apex logo"" class=""logo"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/logo/apex-logo.svg?la=en&amp;hash=91D1B63383C2C22BFA6C47C04E878BFF"" width=""60""/></p>
<p>Global financial services provider Apex Group has made more than 20 acquisitions over the last five years, most recently acquiring its FTSE 250 competitor Sanne Group in a deal worth £1.5bn.</p>
<p>The treasury team works closely with corporate finance and the M&amp;A lead at the outset of each proposed acquisition, developing projection models and playing a crucial role in deciding the appropriate financing facility.</p>
<p>Once the transaction has closed, the team moves on to the process of bringing the treasury elements of the newly acquired business – including banking, cash management, hedging, investments and risk management – into the group’s programme.</p>
<p>“We have a standard playbook that is applied to every acquired business and starts with getting to grips with its bank accounts and bank account structures and its FX hedging requirements,” explains Marcus Worsley, Group Treasurer, Apex Group. “We have a strong focus on working capital management as a business driver so the new entity is brought into our way of managing working capital, which means enhanced collections and billing.”</p>
<p>Regardless of the size of the acquired company Apex looks to migrate it onto the main ERP system, although if there is an existing system in place the acquired company may continue to use that for a while as the integration process is completed.</p>
<p>“We have a number of treasury vehicles within the group where all our debt and liquidity and revolving facilities sit, so one of the first things we do is implement automatic cash sweeping,” adds Worsley. “We don’t hold significant amounts of cash in subsidiary entities.”</p>
<p>Treasury has responsibility for all working capital with the group so all of the entity’s billing, credit control and payments need to be centralised. The team works with the integration and group finance teams to make sure internal working capital facilities are in place and the accounting structure and reporting structure is mapped onto the group’s main ERP and accounting ledger.</p>
<p>In the early stages of a deal the details are communicated to a relatively small number of people, but this group expands once the financing has been confirmed. Worsley explains that the cash management team tends to get brought into these conversations earlier than the billing or payments teams.</p>
<p>“There are numerous meetings to explain how Apex works and how the acquired company team will be onboarded,” he adds.</p>
<p>Over the medium term the acquired business is fully integrated into the central billing team and the main ERP and billing system. It is concurrently integrated with the payments and AP team and onto the group’s vendor management and PO processing systems in conjunction with the ERP so that policies and procedures are standardised across the group.</p>
<p>“The acquisitions that present unexpected challenges are those where the processes of the acquired company are better than ours, in which case we pick up these processes and embed them within our business,” says Worsley. “The billing or cash collection process may be more efficient, or the company may have systems for working capital management that we hadn’t considered.”</p>
<p>For this reason he believes it is important not to assume that your practices will always be better than those of the companies you acquire.</p>
<p>“When we are doing the due diligence we will look at the KPIs the acquired company is producing and how they compare to our KPIs to see where both entities can do things better,” adds Worsley. “We also look at all the processes used from cash matching and reconciliation through billing to credit control.”</p>

<p>“The organisational structure similarly needs to be re-engineered to put appropriately skilled people in the right roles,” adds Rodgers. “Finally, the banking structure needs to be updated to eliminate redundancy, fill coverage gaps and support the business needs of the merged group.”</p>
<p>According to Sander de Vries, Director of treasury consultancy Zanders, it is crucial to understand the changes in the underlying business and how this translates into the requirements the new entity has with regard to treasury activities.</p>
<p>“Treasury’s remit should be defined clearly to understand which activities need to be assessed and how to structure the roles and responsibilities within the new treasury organisation,” he says. “Change management is crucial to ensure a smooth transition so it is important to consider the aspect of culture when defining a plan of approach.”</p>
<p>Kruman reckons integration represents a unique opportunity for the combined enterprise to evaluate treasury environments and identify synergies across systems, processes and teams. She suggests that by thinking strategically about the future needs of the consolidated business, treasury groups can use the integration period to adopt best practices and introduce efficiencies.</p>
<p>de Vries describes the integration process as an opportunity to further professionalise the treasury organisation and its systems although in practice integration timelines are often short, which means the transformation is system-oriented and processes are adjusted to the system’s capabilities.</p>
<p>“Ideally, treasury should invest a bit more time in considering which current processes best fit the new entity and how these can be optimised (for example, by means of automation) to ensure all treasury processes are future proof,” he says.</p>

<p>“The challenge is to find C-suite sponsors who can ensure time is spent on a thorough assessment of treasury activities instead of having treasury focus on short-term oriented integration work. Once there is a clear overview of future processes, treasury should assess if the current treasury system landscape is still future proof. A good understanding of market developments and available system capabilities is paramount.”</p>
<p>The system challenges are often not related to the increased volumes, but more to the increased complexity and to what extent processes are automated. Treasury should determine how processes fit in the treasury management systems and how the additional company/companies and potentially different ERP systems are mapped to treasury.</p>
<p>“To prevent operational bottlenecks it is vital to assess how processes can be implemented in an automated and efficient way with the right treasury system or systems,” adds de Vries.</p>
<p>The integration process is not only an opportunity to review systems and see where improvements could be made but a requirement, since updated policy objectives and re-engineered processes may not sit well with the existing systems architecture says Rodgers.</p>
<p>“In addition, in many cases both merged entities may have existing systems architectures which need to be replaced by a new harmonised infrastructure,” he says. “In the best case scenario one of the entities may have systems which can support the other entity’s needs, but even in this instance there are questions and challenges around data cleansing, migration and cutover.”</p>
<p>Rodgers says the extent to which treasury management systems are sufficiently scalable to handle an increase in volumes as a result of merger or acquisition depends on the system – and specifically its age and design. “In theory (and often in practice) SaaS provides instant provisioning of resources whereas older, non-SaaS systems may have limitations on storage and throughput, particularly if complex calculations are required,” he concludes.</p>

<p>Global treasurers considering where to locate treasury centres in Asia now have options that go beyond the ‘usual suspects’ of Hong Kong and Singapore. However, the events of the last year have shown the need for treasurers to have certainty in a crisis and has pushed them towards the familiar options.</p>
<p>As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, treasurers needed greater access to liquidity and so established financial centres have remained the go-to locations for regional treasury centres. “Liquidity requirements went up massively last year,” says Anton Ruddenklau, Head of Financial Services at KPMG in Singapore. “Liquidity rules – the cost of funds is not the issue, it’s just making sure there is access to cash,” he adds. In this environment it is critical for a corporate’s regional treasury centre to be located where there is access to liquidity and banking services.</p>
<p>Varoon Mandhana, Head of APAC Solutions, Wholesale Payments at J.P. Morgan, explains that the overall financial ecosystem is important to locating a treasury centre. Given the key function of the treasury is to manage cash, funding and handle multiple currencies, it needs to be able access deep and liquid financial markets. In this respect, locations like Hong Kong and Singapore offer a more holistic environment, he says.</p>
<p>Access to financial services is just one of the factors that influences a group treasurer’s decision about where to locate their regional treasury centre. There are also other elements that come into play, points out David Blair, Managing Director at Acarate Consulting. “Treasurers need to locate treasury centres in places that are open, tax effective, and have deep talent pools. This does not leave much choice in Asia – and benefits Singapore enormously,” he says.</p>
<p>For multinationals, whose operations in Asia have reached the point where it is worthwhile to have a treasury centre in the region, the major decision still remains Hong Kong or Singapore – a situation that has not changed greatly in recent years. However, there are now newer options that are emerging to rival the dominance of the ‘usual suspects’ of these financial centres.</p>
<p>Prem Thakur, General Manager, Finance and Treasury at Sopra Steria, a consulting, digital services and software firm, comments on the alternatives: “Other potential regional treasury centre locations are emerging, including Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok and various cities in India,” Thakur tells Treasury Today Asia. He adds that India, the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia are often attractive locations for financial shared service centres – including payment and collection factories – general ledger reconciliations, foreign exchange settlement and back office confirmations.</p>
<p>The newer locations for treasury centres are fast emerging, says Sandip Patil, Asia Pacific Head of Liquidity Management Services and Head of Sales for Financial Institutions, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi. “One such example is Shanghai, driven by a number of factors – China’s scale, particularly in an Asian context; increasingly favourable policies introduced by Chinese regulators; sound financial infrastructure; and the availability of talent.”</p>
<p>China has been making efforts to lure multinationals to Shanghai. Blair gives the example of how China, in the context of internationalising the renminbi, has introduced regulatory facilitation to attract treasury activities like inter-company funding and foreign exchange risk management to Shanghai. The jury is still out, however, on whether Shanghai can be a serious contender to the likes of Singapore and Hong Kong for regional treasury centres in the near term. Some observers comment that the liberalisation of the economy has somewhat stalled, and although there has been a push for renminbi internationalisation, free trade zones, and tax benefits, it is too early for treasury centres in Shanghai to be supporting the whole region.</p>
<p>Another location that has emerged as an alternative location is Thailand. Mandhana at J.P. Morgan notes that a number of Japanese and Korean corporations have manufacturing bases in Thailand and in recent years the country has created incentives – such as tax reductions and the simplification of reporting processes – to encourage them to set up treasury centres. As of February 22nd 2021, 38 companies had treasury centre licenses in Thailand, he notes.</p>
<p>For companies that have a larger presence elsewhere in Asia, however, a treasury centre in Thailand is unlikely to meet all their requirements around regional cash consolidation and multi-currency management, says Mandhana. “In such situations, we have often seen corporates adopt a two-pronged strategy of linking the treasury centre in Thailand to their regional or global treasury centre over a common banking infrastructure ie a hub and spoke model,” Mandhana explains.</p>
<p>Malaysia is also on the radar of corporate treasurers, with some considering treasury centres in Kuala Lumpur. Like Thailand, Malaysia has been offering incentives to corporates, but one observer comments that the intention is really to prevent their domestic companies going to Singapore, rather than seriously attracting treasury operations away from Hong Kong or Singapore.</p>
<p>With the alternative locations, there are also other drawbacks. Blair at Acarate Consulting says, “China, Thailand and Malaysia are all controlled countries with regulatory barriers that make them unattractive for treasury centres. They tend to be used for domestic and cross-border ex-country activities rather than true regional treasury.” Thailand and Malaysia, he notes, have been more focused on their local multinational corporations.</p>
<p>Ruddenklau comments that Thailand and Malaysia are attractive secondary locations for treasury centres, but they are not that developed yet – for example, in terms of talent. This issue of access to the right talent is a serious consideration and plays a major role in the distinction between what is needed for a treasury centre as opposed to a shared service centre (SSC). Blair notes that with shared service centres – where treasury processes are effected for legal entities elsewhere – the requirements are lower for corporate treasurers. Whereas treasury centres require open markets and reasonable taxation, and a more highly-educated workforce (as can be found in Hong Kong and Singapore), SSCs use cheaper, English-speaking clerical labour. “Philippines and Malaysia are enjoying some success for SSCs and processing, but they are very difficult places from regulatory and tax perspectives,” Blair tells Treasury Today Asia.</p>
<p>Another location that has been keen to encourage multinationals to set up regional treasury centres is India. Thakur at Sopra Steria says, however, that it is still early days.  There are many reasons why India would be an attractive location, Thakur explains. These include its highly-educated English-speaking workforce, cheap labour and resources, and a pool of skilled treasurers. Also, looking to the future of corporate treasury, India also has skills in robotics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and blockchain, which hold potential for treasury’s transformation in the future.</p>
<p>A shift toward digitisation is also having an impact on corporate treasuries are organised. As more processes are automated, there will be less need for shared service centres, for example. Automation will remove the manual labour that is often associated with such centres – where there has often been a lot of rekeying of data, for example – and headcount will likely disappear from offshore locations. Ruddenklau comments that having a shared service centre in Malaysia, for example, is no longer a badge of honour for multinational corporations. “It is an indication of poor process and poor levels of automation,” he says.</p>
<p>If the main motivation for having a regional treasury centre in Asia is for the cost savings, this benefit may now be eroding. This is not just in the headcount savings that come with increased automation, but also the tax benefits that have traditionally been associated with treasury centre locations.</p>
<p>Alan Lau, Partner, Head of Financial Services, Tax at KPMG in Singapore explains that recent developments regarding tax could be a factor in the deciding where to locate a treasury centre. Hong Kong and Singapore’s corporate taxation rates have been in line with a global trend of declining rates. Their headline corporate tax rates, for example – of 17% for Singapore and 16.5% for Hong Kong – are similar to the UK’s 19%, for example. In this context, Hong Kong and Singapore went one step further and cut these rates further to incentivise multinationals to set up treasury centres there – to 8% in Singapore and 8.25% in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>However, these tax incentives could be eroded by developments elsewhere, points out Lau. For example, the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has an action plan on base erosion and profit sharing (BEPS), which targets multinationals that exploit loopholes in tax regimes and ultimately avoid paying tax. Under the OECD’s action plan, there was a move to eradicate ‘harmful tax practices’, which could have had serious implications for the treasury centres in Singapore, for example, if the tax incentives were deemed to be too low and harmful. Lau explains that Singapore – where he is based – was very cooperative and provided documentation to the OECD that explained why the low corporate rate is justified. The good news, he says, is that the low corporate tax rate is not considered ‘harmful’.</p>
<p>However, since then, there has been a move to smooth the differences between tax rates in various jurisdictions. Under BEPS 2.0, explains Lau, there could be a global minimum tax rate that could be higher than the rates for treasury centre locations like Singapore. Lau illustrates with a hypothetical example of a UK multinational corporation that sets up a finance and treasury centre in Singapore. Conceptually, if the proposed global minimum tax rate were set at 12%, and the Singapore rate is 8% – ie below the global minimum rate – then the UK multinational would have to make up the difference between the two rates and pay the top-up tax in their home country. In this scenario, Lau says, “You effectively do not get any benefit from the incentive of setting up the treasury centre in a low-tax location.”</p>
<p>If this global minimum tax rate is realised, a group treasurer may decide it does not make sense to locate a treasury centre in Singapore or Hong Kong purely for tax reasons because they would have to top up the global minimum in their home country anyway. “It is still in limbo,” says Lau of the decision on the global rate. “They have not come out to explicitly say what the magic number will be.” Also, the details of how it would be administered, or what exceptions there will be, have yet to be revealed. “It remains to be seen how it will play out,” Lau tells Treasury Today Asia. And added to this move by the OECD is the news that the Biden administration in the United States is planning to push for a global tax rate that would be even higher. Such as move could erode how meaningful it is to have a treasury centre in Singapore or Hong Kong, especially if the main motivation for setting one up is for the tax benefits.</p>
<p>When looking at the tax benefits of where to locate a treasury centre, Lau comments that it is important to look beyond the main corporation tax rate. “Some group treasurers who do not have a deep understanding of taxation codes get fixated on the headline tax rate,” Lau tells Treasury Today Asia. He explains that it is the withholding tax rates that can have more effect. For example, if a company is paying US$100 cross-border to Malaysia and the withholding tax is 10%, it holds back US$10 and pays the net US$90 to Malaysia. For a location to be effective as a treasury centre, it needs to have a low corporate tax rate, and also lower rates for when the treasurer pays out cross-border – otherwise this withholding tax can overwhelm the benefit of the headline tax incentive.</p>
<p>Mandhana at J.P. Morgan comments that many treasury centres are operating as cost centres – and therefore not generating profits on which tax would need to be paid. The bigger consideration is the inter-company positions and the withholding tax treatment they have, and the double taxation treaties the location has. “Hong Kong and Singapore are well-placed on that aspect,” says Mandhana.</p>
<p>Singapore and Hong Kong continue to be the obvious choices for a number of reasons, aside from the tax benefits. For US and European multinational corporations with sizable operations in China, Hong Kong has been the natural choice for a regional treasury centre. Meanwhile for corporates with a presence in South East Asia, Singapore has been the gateway to those markets.</p>
<p>For some larger multinationals, it may not be a case of either Singapore or Hong Kong – they could a regional treasury centre in both locations. They may use Hong Kong for their mainland business and onshore and offshore renminbi, and Singapore for the South East Asian currencies. Also, having two centres can help with business continuity planning and each can act as the other’s back up in the same time zone.</p>
<p>Patil at Citi comments that aside from the considerations that typically drove decision-making about treasury centres – legal and markets infrastructure, tax policies and so on – there are now broader considerations. These considerations, he says, are expanding in scope to support a company’s growth and the client experience. “This expanded scope includes consideration for e-commerce business model needs, supply chain and manufacturing shifts, digital infrastructure and real time connectivity, as well as aspirations of digital treasury,” he says.</p>
<p>Patil continues, “On one hand, these increased considerations are leading companies to converge the scope of regional treasury centres with shared services centres. On the other hand, we are also seeing treasury centres that are more specialised and focused on specific geographies, including North Asia, ASEAN [Association of South East Asian Nation countries] and South Asia. By operating in this manner, these centres can better connect with their businesses on the ground and more effectively manage disruptions in supply chains while benefiting from the continued growth of the digital economy and eventually, Covid recovery,” he says.</p>
<p>Blair at Acarate Consulting comments on another trend, “The other macro change we see cycling approximately every decade is for multinational corporations to centralise everything to head office – enabled by technology – then realise they need local or at least regional knowledge so they come back to Singapore.”</p>
<p>For now, however, Singapore and Hong Kong remain the dominant choices for treasury centre locations. And while there are other alternatives available, they have yet to be serious contenders to match the attractiveness of these ‘usual suspects’.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Ever since Brexit ended 50 years of frictionless trade between the EU and UK, alongside ushering in new custom rules on shipments from mainland UK to Northern Ireland, UK business spanning shellfish to fashion have been scrambling to adjust. Simple rules guiding access to a market which accounted for 43% of exports and more than half of imports in 2019 have morphed into a bureaucratic nightmare under the post-Brexit EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA). Further afield, the US earnings season is highlighting corporate concerns of rising costs, most visible in soaring commodity prices. Against the backdrop of ongoing supply-chain shocks, businesses face a myriad of challenges scaling up production to meet new demand. It is a difficult time for treasury, where key strategies remain cash management, nurturing growth and scenario planning.</p>
<h4 id=""brexit-and-northern-ireland"">Brexit and Northern Ireland</h4>
<p>For Shipley-based aerospace manufacturer Produmax, Brexit fallout remains an enduring headache, none more so than grappling with the new duties and costly customs paperwork now needed for its exports to Northern Ireland. Although the bulk of the SME’s flight control components go to markets outside Europe, 20% go to Northern Ireland, home to customers like the former Bombardier factory now owned by the US’s Spirit AeroSystems.</p>
<p>“Having a border within a country is nuts,” laments Produmax’s Owner and Financial Director Mandy Ridyard. “My customers pay to pick the goods up from me, but ultimately, whether I pay or the customer pays, there is a charge that makes the costs of my goods more expensive. Currently, we are in a position whereby goods shipped within our own country have become more expensive because of Brexit.”</p>
<p>She estimates it will cost the salary of half an employee annually to fill in the required paperwork. And although Produmax’s worldwide trade means the team are well versed in the complexity of export form filling, she says the SME would have benefited from having a unique point of contact at HMRC like large corporates have. “Even though the government has put in lots of help, there is nothing like a relationship. We have spent a long time sitting on helplines and talking to someone generic,” she says.</p>
<p>Witness how processing relief became a minefield thanks to unknowns around whether sales to Northern Ireland counted as an export. “One of the things we couldn’t get to grips with was if we could use our inward processing relief for what we ship to Northern Ireland – we didn’t know if we were transferring the duty. The rules on Northern Ireland were written at the last minute and it was complicated.” Fortunately, she has been able to draw on key support from her customers – something she links particularly to the close-knit aerospace sector. “In aerospace, you typically have lots of small companies supplying one big customer; our customers are close to what is going on.” She also valued the expertise of the sector’s trade body. “You need to make sure as a business you are invested in your trade body and that you have good relationships with your customers.”</p>
<p>Although Brexit hasn’t resulted in any delays in essential flows and components into the factory from EU suppliers, it remains to be seen if this is due to reduced trade flows because of the pandemic. “When you don’t have customers screaming for parts it doesn’t matter so much – there is more time to get things through.” Moreover, the UK hasn’t introduced import checks for goods from the EU yet, raising fears of even more bureaucratic problems when that happens next January.</p>
<h4 id=""cash-is-king-at-kodak"">Cash is king at Kodak</h4>
<p>The UK’s departure from the EU and ensuing bureaucratic quagmire may not be on the radar to the same extent for US manufacturers, but other treasury challenges are just as real. None more so than cash management, says Matthew Ebersold, Treasurer at US photography pioneer Kodak, who explains in an interview from the company’s Rochester, New York headquarters that identifying and driving efficiencies in cash management remains his overriding concern.</p>
<p>Kodak, which lacks a positive operating cash flow, had to make tough decisions to reduce its cash use through the height of the pandemic – a spend which still hit US$34m in 2020. “Through a combination of vendor payment changes, general spending limitations, employee furloughs and pay reductions, Kodak mitigated the reduction in sales,” says Ebersold. Although tough choices are “never easy,” he is resolute this early action ensured the company’s ability to shore up its cash position. “We were able to avoid any liquidity concerns through these actions and also stabilised the cash used in, and provided by, our core businesses during 2020 including US$25m in a liability clean-up and US$12m investment in our growth areas.”</p>
<p>Now his focus is on creating a more robust and efficient cash management system ahead. “We are a global company with over 40 active legal entities and hundreds of bank accounts around the world. We are investigating potential changes to our banking structure across the globe and opportunities to reduce bank accounts and associated fees. We will also be investigating the use of AI and new banking products through this process,” he says.</p>
<p>Such is the importance and value of cash since the pandemic, its generation at Kodak is now viewed as a key metric of success. Ebersold’s team prepare weekly cash flow forecasts by country, followed by detailing the extent forecasts tally with reality to senior management and finance teams around the globe. “We are relied upon to ensure cash spend is controlled, review spending at the vendor level and support cash needs across our businesses and locations,” he says.</p>
<p>Cash and freeing up working capital is also a priority at Produmax. As a consequence of both pre-Brexit planning and now pandemic overhang, the manufacturer has been left holding much more stock than usual. The company increased its stock before Brexit, then COVID hit, demand fell away, and orders got pushed back, explains Ridyard. “For a small company, it is a bit of double whammy,” she says. “Our working capital requirements have escalated because we held stock for Brexit. On the other hand, customers haven’t been taking the orders we expected, and we are holding finished goods waiting for payment.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere, she explains how the company is also tapping new raw material sources to meet different order specifications. It makes for an expensive, cash hungry business, and holds the ingredients of a potentially perfect storm. “We can’t sell what we’ve already made because it’s not needed and won’t be for a while, and we’ve got more raw materials than we need. We’ve recently won new business which is now coming in, but it requires us to buy different raw materials to make the components. This will take longer, and ultimately means we’ll have to wait longer to get paid.”</p>
<h4 id=""supporting-growth"">Supporting growth</h4>
<p>Cash management is integral to helping fund Kodak’s growth plans as the company hunts new markets and products in a post-COVID world. Despite coming up with a prototype for the first digital camera back in 1975, Kodak stuck with film, misjudged the digital revolution and filed for bankruptcy in 2012. Since then, new business lines have included a cryptocurrency and expansion of its ability to manufacture ingredients for pharmaceuticals. Now its traditional printing segment, Kodak’s largest segment, has had and is expected to continue to have declining revenues, acknowledges Ebersold. Growth will be focused on niche areas in print like a digital packaging business following the company’s wide-ranging re-financing in 2021. “The print industry was adversely impacted by the COVID pandemic but has been recovering. It remains unclear whether print volumes will fully return to pre-pandemic levels. These declines within our print businesses are expected to be partially offset through growth in specific areas like digital packaging.”</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>It leaves Ebersold preparing treasury for “active participation” in the company’s growth strategy. “We will be engaged with the finance and business teams leading our growth spend initiatives with a focus on controlling spend within approved guidelines and expectations,” he says, describing a balancing act ahead: using cash to invest in growth on one hand but keeping spending disciplined, and a focus on achieving a significant ROI on “any and all” investments on the other. “We need to ensure our cost controls remain in place, look for opportunities to settle legacy liabilities at a reasonable cost and ensure the company continues to move from cash use to cash generation.”</p>
<p>At Produmax, strategy is focused on diversifying sales into new markets – in stark contrast to recent years in the aerospace sector when Ridyard has struggled to meet demand. “We have too much capacity for the orders we have now,” she reflects. Investment has also been toned down. Produmax is running a “tight ship” in terms of cutting its usual investment spend, but the company is still investing in a key new satellite factory in Silverstone. “Our investment strategy is specifically focused on increasing our ability to sell. This factory is not a general investment – we have put a lot of stuff on hold.”</p>
<h4 id=""price-rises"">Price rises</h4>
<p>Treasury teams are also having to grapple with higher prices. Executives at the world’s largest brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev in Belgium recently cautioned that pressure on margins would continue due to higher commodity prices and packaging costs for drinks consumed at home. Elsewhere, European manufacturers have been hit by a surge in the price of polymer resins used to make plastic. According to market information service ICIS, polyethylene and polypropylene prices, the most commonly used plastic resins, have risen 25% since December to €1,500 per tonne, the highest level since 2015. A worrying shortage of cardboard packaging is on Ridyard’s mind, something she attributes to the “Amazon effect” and jump in online shopping. “Apparently the mills can’t get the raw material. If you can’t package your goods, you can’t sell them.”</p>
<p>In the US, more companies are warning of higher prices ahead, thanks to supply-chain bottlenecks and spikes in raw material and labour costs. Like Coca-Cola, where CFO John Murphy said during the company’s first quarter earnings that he expected a “relatively benign impact in 2021 from rising commodity costs due to the company’s hedged position,” but that inflation could become more of a headwind particularly around inputs like high fructose corn syrup metals and other packaging materials. Add in President Biden’s plans for the first major federal tax hike since 1993 with proposals to increase corporate taxes to 28% from 21%, and corporates will feel another bite.</p>
<p>The prospect of the US government raising interest rates to counter inflation isn’t a concern for Ebersold. “The company certainly monitors interest rate policy, but our current debt and preferred stock are at fixed interest and dividend rates and any current change in policy would not have a direct impact on our structure,” he says. The policy change he is most mindful of is LIBOR reform. “We are actively monitoring the LIBOR cessation programme and the transition to an alternative reference rate. While the majority of our LIBOR references are linked to inter-company loan agreements, our ABL Credit Agreement and Letter of Credit Facility also reference LIBOR. We want to be in a position where our path forward is set prior to the cessation date with changes to our contracts complete well in advance of the ultimate transaction date at the end of the year,” he says.</p>
<p>Navigating the dual impact of Brexit and the pandemic has meant treasury and finance solutions have played an unprecedented central role at Produmax. Ridyard is constantly scenario planning and running budgets in a proactive strategy to ensure she has a finger on the pulse, or as she puts it, instant recall of her P&amp;L balance sheet and sales ledger. “I have never run as many scenario plans as I have now,” she says, listing forecasts spanning raising more finance to scenarios on slowing down depreciation on machine tools which have lain idle during the pandemic. Elsewhere she has looked at moving the year end and modelled outcomes on R&amp;D tax credit to release cash.</p>
<p>Pushing finance centre stage for an SME is more challenging than at a big company which has in-house experts. “We have had to learn and upskill really quickly. Especially around things that we wouldn’t have considered in the past because they are quite technical.” Quite an achievement for only a five-strong finance team of whom only herself and one other are at the “top end of treasury.”</p>
<p>Similarly, Ebersold concludes with reflections on how treasury at Kodak now reaches into so many parts of the business. “The great part of my job is being involved across so many important projects within Kodak and interacting with all levels of employees across the company,” he concludes. “I know with certainty my days will be filled with challenging and interesting work. I also know that no matter my plans, most days what I expect to work on can and will change as new questions and projects arise. It is an exciting time to work for Kodak and I look forward to the successful turnaround to cash generation.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Carl Sharman, Head of Treasury Technology Advisory at Deloitte, says that during his career as a consultant he has seen a considerable shift in terms of the treasurer’s role. “Back when I started 13 years ago, there was a sense that treasury was doing treasury things and not actually engaging with the business,” he says. “From a consulting perspective, we were trying to encourage treasurers to get out of the office and partner with the business by offering up their skill sets – particularly in areas such as enterprise risk management.”</p>
<p>At the time of the 2008 financial crisis, Sharman says the increased profile of the treasurer meant some were predicting treasurers would end up on the board of directors. “We never saw that happen – the treasurer still reports to the CFO in almost every organisation, and the CFO is the finance representative on the board,” he says. “And that leaves the treasurer to perhaps utilise their time better by going and supporting business units or other stakeholders.”</p>
<p>Alex Young, head of Corporate Sales for GTS EMEA at Bank of America (BofA), says that in recent years the treasurer’s role has continued to evolve. As a result, it now plays a far more strategic role in driving company results, while also demonstrating an increased focus on risk mitigation across the organisation. “Looking at FTSE 100 clients in the UK, and their peers across other European countries, treasurers have always been very close to the strategy of the business – but increasingly, they are becoming more strategic in their roles,” he says.</p>
<p>As a result, he says treasurers’ day-to-day responsibilities have continued to grow, with treasurers taking a more proactive approach to risk management, protecting the balance sheet and putting in place clear foreign exchange and hedging strategies across the organisation. Where cash management is concerned, he notes that treasurers’ areas of focus include the need for accurate cash forecasting and maintaining a strong liquidity position. And at the same time, treasurers are increasingly playing a role in developing an ESG agenda and supporting the company’s strategy in this area.</p>
<h4 id=""hub-and-spokes"">Hub and spokes</h4>
<p>Given their increasingly wider remit, it’s clear that treasurers need to support a variety of internal colleagues and stakeholders in different ways. As Young comments, “treasuries are like a hub with many spokes reaching out to various functions and units across the business.”</p>
<p>For example, he says, in addition to regular discussions with the broader finance team, treasury has expanded engagement with areas as diverse as accounts payable, accounts receivable, procurement, inventory management and sales. “And obviously, in recent years companies have set up shared service centres or centres of excellence, which may include payment factories or in-house banks – but also audit, HR and legal, which are also key functions that treasury will have connectivity with.”</p>
<p>For treasurers who need to communicate effectively with those points of contact, there’s no one-size-fits-all approach. “I will always try to engage with other departments within an organisation to better understand how the organisation functions and where and how one can contribute,” says Daniel Jefferies, Group Treasurer at Equiniti Group. He observes that since everyone is different, there is no one specific method that can be used to do this effectively – “consequently one would aim to use soft skills and emotional intelligence, whilst always being honest and open.”</p>
<h4 id=""building-connections"">Building connections</h4>
<p>When it comes to supporting business units and other stakeholders across the enterprise, it’s clear that treasury has plenty to offer. For example, BofA’s Young points out that treasury will be able to provide critical data on the company’s foreign exchange exposures, and will be able to advise on currency restrictions in different countries, which is an important consideration when it comes to operating across global geographies or to support expansion or acquisition in new markets.</p>
<p>The procure-to-pay cycle is another area where treasurers can add value, as Jack Spitzer, Senior Vice President of Finance at Plexus Worldwide, explains. “There are efficiencies to be gained through automation which can shorten cycle times, increase visibility, improve analytics and allow valuable time to be redirected to more value-added tasks,” he says. “The motivation can be cash improvements, better data or reduced variability for improved forecasting, or even cost reduction (profit-enhancing).”</p>
<p>Another important relationship is that between the treasury department and the legal department, explains Sigurd Dahrendorf, the former treasurer of braking and control systems manufacturer Knorr-Bremse. Noting that different treasury departments will have different responsibilities, he says that many will need to address legal problems in relation to financing, bank negotiations, closing contracts and guarantees.</p>



<blockquote>Treasurers have always been very close to the strategy of the business – but  increasingly, they are becoming more strategic in their roles.</blockquote>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>“In such cases, it is very important to have very good cooperation with the legal department,” he says. “It is essential to have someone within the legal department who is specialised and experienced in treasury-related matters.” He adds that as well as having a clear view of legal considerations, lawyers also need to have a good financial understanding.</p>
<p>Consequently, in his previous role Dahrendorf worked with Legal Counsel to build a team of such people. As a result, the company was able to create rules to follow when assessing new contracts and guarantees. “This made it possible for the treasury people to have a first look over the legal requirements,” he adds. “For more complicated constructions, the relevant experts from the legal department were at our disposal – we did not have to explain a lot to them as we were a team for a long time.”</p>
<p>Consequently, Dahrendorf says it was easier to assess legal documents within the treasury department, as well as being in a position to discover any disadvantageous legal formulations at an early stage.</p>
<h4 id=""thinking-outside-the-box"">Thinking outside the box</h4>
<p>Deloitte’s Sharman argues that the treasurers who tend to be the better performers are those who are not only focused on treasury matters, but who also work to understand how the business operates from beginning to end. “They will then figure out how they can add value to any part of that chain,” he says. “So if they work in a retail business, they will figure out where the company buys from, who it sells to and where it operates in the world.”</p>
<p>In a truly global organisation, Sharman adds, the best way treasurers can support their business units is by mapping their function to the underlying business. “It’s really about finding where the skill sets fit,” he comments. “So to take construction as an example, the treasurer would be looking at cash, risk and debt for the business as a whole at the macro level – but you’d also have smaller projects or initiatives where the treasurer’s skillset can be used to help the running of the business.” This might involve advising on how the cost of capital might inform decisions about which projects to embark on, or helping with cash collection at the micro level to keep those projects moving.</p>
<p>In particular, Sharman emphasises that by having a clear understanding of the business, treasurers will be better placed to optimise their cash forecasting process: “To be able to forecast cash, you need to understand how the underlying business flows work so that you can attach cash flows to those business flows.” By speaking to people throughout the business, he says, treasurers can gain a greater understanding of how cash moves through the organisation and thereby build a more accurate forecasting model.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not only treasurers who need to look beyond the parameters of their own jobs. As Spitzer notes, “It’s imperative that we educate business units on how their actions or lack of actions influence the company’s financial and cash status. We need to make this mentality part of their mindset.”</p>
<h4 id=""achieving-alignment"">Achieving alignment</h4>
<p>One important consideration when it comes to collaborating with business units is the need for common goals. “You might have one unit which is purely focused on sales and margin, whereas another unit might be measuring working capital efficiency – and those two are somewhat in conflict with each other,” says BofA’s Young. “So what you need is that clear alignment across the board, and where possible, one goal or objective that everyone is working to within the company.”</p>
<p>This alignment can be achieved by the treasurer working closely with the CFO, as well as with the various heads of all lines of business. “I think it’s important for each of the departments to understand what the benefit is to the organisation of deploying a programme or solution,” says Young. Where working capital solutions such as card solutions and supply chain finance are concerned, he says there are clear benefits when treasury and procurement work together in lockstep.</p>
<p>In addition, treasury can have an important role to play when it comes to supporting the business as it moves into new business models and new routes to market. Young says many of the bank’s consumer and retail clients are increasingly moving away from bricks-and-mortar sales into online sales, not least because of the opportunities for greater cost efficiencies and better controls. “That’s great for the company strategy, but how does that impact treasury and the management of the company’s cash?” he comments. “So it’s about open communication and alignment, with the treasurer able to suggest which digital and online solutions can allow their clients to interact with the business more effectively.”</p>
<h4 id=""current-challenges"">Current challenges</h4>
<p>Of course, the current COVID-19 pandemic presents additional challenges where this topic is concerned. Young says that the crisis has placed a huge focus on the treasurer, and that “the profile of the treasurer within the organisations we are working with has never been higher.”</p>
<p>Initially, he says, the focus was on the company’s business continuity planning (BCP) strategy. “Week one was all about how the organisation would continue to operate effectively from home; on whether all those business areas were functioning correctly and adequately funded; on whether businesses could make payroll and whether they had sufficient cash on the balance sheet,” he says. “So that was the first priority.”</p>
<p>Beyond this, he says treasurers’ priorities have included ensuring that the treasury is in control of the cash flow forecasting process and working with the C-suite to consider what steps might be needed to boost the company’s liquidity over the medium-term solvency cycle. “That of course leads to funding, and we’ve certainly been seeing an enormous amount of capital raising across the industry and across the globe,” Young says.</p>
<p>Alongside these actions, Young says treasurers have continued to focus on the importance of communicating effectively with business units. “I think that’s essential at this point in time,” he says. “Typically this might mean keeping in touch more regularly here and there, but I think more communication is key at the moment, and we’ve certainly seen that across the corporate organisations we’ve spoken to.” As well as adapting to a working from home environment, it is the role of the treasurer not only to implement but also to anticipate the needs of the business, Young notes. “And that includes anticipating what they see as key priorities on the other side of this crisis.”</p>
<p>In terms of what communication with business units might look like in light of the crisis, Spitzer says that if a company is in a strong balance sheet position and prepared for a shock event like COVID-19, with a contingency plan in place, “the message is two-fold”. First, he says, treasurers need to convey a message of reassurance and positivity – “We have a strong balance sheet, our financial prudence has put us in a good position.” Second, treasurers should remind everyone about the contingency planning and the actions that will be taken.</p>
<p>“In uncertain times, you don’t take strength for granted,” Spitzer concludes. “Usually contingency involves reining-in spending, so this is where treasurers can work with Financial Planning to clearly communicate, ensure execution and provide updated forecasts.”</p>



<h2 class=""h3 copy__heading"">Managing business units during a pandemic</h2>
<p> <img alt=""Wolters kluwer logo"" height=""25"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/logos/wolters-kluwer-logo-2019-160x25.png?la=en&amp;hash=6C83A12FC856FDFB55555A4775AC34CF"" width=""160""/>
<p>George Dessing is Executive Vice President, Treasury &amp; Risk at Wolters Kluwer, which provides professional information, software solutions and services for a number of sectors. Dessing explains that treasury is viewed as a holistic role within the company, with his responsibilities including global treasury, risk management, (non-IT) business continuity and real estate.</p>
<p>In previous Treasury Today articles, Dessing has argued that treasurers need to be visible and proactive in order to support business growth. But in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s clear that some flexibility is needed if treasurers are to maintain effective relationships within the organisation.</p>
<p>While the company has taken steps to support its clients, partners, consumers and communities with COVID-19 resources, Dessing says his areas of focus include incident management, which follows the PEAR principle (People, Environment, Assets, Reputation). “It is our common foundation for building our incident strategy, action and communication plans, which align with our company’s values,” he says. “Even in tough situations, we’re stronger together.”</p>
<p>Where treasury is concerned, Dessing emphasises the importance of the following characteristics at a time of uncertainty and volatility:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Be prompt</strong>. “Treasurers need to stay ahead of the curve, rather than waiting for the moment that cash is needed,” says Dessing. “Therefore, securing your liquidity and cash flow needs to be even more top of mind in times of a crisis.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be proactive</strong>. “This includes connecting with internal and external groups, such as business units and banks,” says Dessing. “A new trend could be consolidation, bankruptcies, and restructuring which could offer opportunities for larger (digital) companies.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be the ‘guardian of cash’</strong>. Dessing says: “In today’s digital environment, treasurers should drive awareness of fraud risk, especially when your employees work from home. We need to remember to stay vigilant for COVID-19 related cyber fraud.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be open minded</strong>. “Now is the time for change as I believe that this crisis will do something good as a big drive to automate payment processes and start eliminating the paper approach of US check processing – ‘digital dominates, less print’.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be passionate and care for your employees</strong>. “Our people will ask themselves what is important in their lives, like for example their (virtual) work-life balance – it is important to be supportive of others’ ideas.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be a team player</strong>. “Being a strategic partner means being open and connected, as well as an effective communicator,” says Dessing. “Especially now that everybody is working from home, it feels that we are more connected than ever before.”</p>
</li>
</ul></p>

Interesting times: the treasurer’s perspective on interest rates,"


<p><em>It’s been well over a decade since the global financial crisis of 2008, and the global trend of low interest rates looks set to continue into the year ahead. What do treasurers need to know about interest rates going forward, and how can they weather the current stagnant environment?</em></p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The job of any central bank is to alter its money supply to try and manage the economy and control inflation through its base interest rate. When monetary policymakers decide to change interest rates, demand in the economy is affected via multiple channels.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, whenever interest rates rise, consumers with debts pay more in interest to lenders. This has a negative effect on consumer spending habits because if consumers have more money to pay to keep their loans current, the less disposable income they will have to spend on products and services. More are also inclined to save not spend.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when interest rates are cut, the cost of borrowing decreases for both businesses and consumers. This can help spur spending on capital goods – which not only helps an economy’s long-term performance, but can also help spur household expenditures on homes or durables like cars and white goods.</p>
<h4 id=""tumultuous-times"">Tumultuous times</h4>
<p>At present, the global economy is operating below potential and inflation pressures remain muted. Interest rates in many developed markets are still close to, if not at, emergency levels. This gives limited room for central banks to reduce rates further to stimulate growth.</p>
<p>The key major central bank that does have room to cut rates is the US Federal Reserve. Although the US economy remains relatively robust, its cycle is mature. It has had no negative quarter for more than ten years and inflation is below the Fed’s target level.</p>
<p>In late July, the Fed moved to an easing bias, cutting rates by 0.25% for the first time in over a decade. However, this was driven less by domestic growth concerns and more by global trade tensions.</p>
<p>In the UK, the Bank of England (BoE) has signalled many times to the market that it would like to gradually increase rates over the next two to three years and distance itself from the present emergency levels. Yet despite a strong labour market, the BoE has also been thwarted by Brexit uncertainty. This has led to falling business confidence and investment, with official figures showing that GDP contracted by 0.2% in the second quarter of 2019.</p>
<p>Taking all of these factors into account, how do central bank policymakers decide when to alter interest rates, and if so, by how much?</p>


<h2 class=""h3 copy__heading"">Cash flow forecasting</h2>
<p>Cash flow forecasting is the lifeblood for any treasury department, which is why teams cannot afford to get it wrong. Being able to forecast cash flows enables organisations to manage outstanding debts, invest wisely and better understand their overall capabilities.</p>
<p>With interest rates at record lows, for corporate treasurers with good access to credit and capital markets, the cost/benefit of proper cash flow forecasting may not seem justifiable. However, in today’s uncertain times, treasurers can no longer ignore liquidity risk.</p>
<p>But in today’s marketplace, there is a wide variety of cash flow forecasting software and management tools available to help. These give treasurers the ability to collect and consolidate data, as well being able to interact with different systems and perform simple ‘what-if’ scenarios – and this is the key.</p>
<p>Our world is volatile; major economic and political surprises such as Brexit, worsening relations between the US and China and the unpredictable world economy in general, are events today’s treasurer has to deal with on an almost day-to-day basis. These factors can put stress upon any corporate’s cash flow without warning.</p>
<p>However, corporates that are able to think in cash flows will indeed be in a much better position to survive than others. As the saying goes: “forewarned is forearmed”, so regardless of whether interest rates rise or fall, accurate cash flow forecasting is not just important, it’s essential.</p>
<p>The key is understanding every department’s plans. To take some examples, treasurers should make an effort to understand what the mergers and acquisitions team is thinking, or if more factories need to be built, for example. A good understanding of the longer-term cash flow allows for careful planning.</p>
<p>“It’s all about being prepared and understanding what the organisation is doing so that you can actually be prepared and be slightly ahead of the game,” says Sarah Boyce, Associate Director, Policy and Technical at the Association of Corporate Treasurers (ACT). “Should the finance team say it wants to borrow money, or wants to sell an asset, treasurers will be one step ahead. Armed with accurate data, they will have plenty of ideas of how to raise the cash, or what might be done with it.”</p>
<p>Even though rates are low, they do still offer an opportunity for those organisations with the right tools and strategies in place to capitalise upon these trends. But fail to adequately prepare for an increase or further cuts and teams could end up destroying value in their organisations pretty quickly.</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h4 id=""the-taylor-rule"">The Taylor Rule</h4>
<p>The most famous guide for policymakers is the ‘Taylor Rule’ and is used to provide a reasonable explanation for why policy took the path that it did. At the core of the Taylor Rule is that inflation-targeting central banks have a trade-off between inflation and output. Above-target inflation puts upward pressure on the appropriate interest rate while a shortfall of demand relative to potential provides downward pressure.</p>
<p>In the original 1993 version of the Taylor Rule, equal weight was given to inflation and output shocks, but this itself depends on the reaction of the policymakers, and need not be constant through time.</p>
<p>A common mistake is to say that inflation or gross domestic product (GDP) growth is high and that the policy rate is therefore too low, but this is only true in a relative sense. An increase in GDP growth or inflation implies that the interest rate might need to be a bit higher than it otherwise would have been, but that is not the same as saying a change is needed.</p>
<p>According to Philip Rush, Founder and Chief Economist at Heteronomics, interest rate levels should always focus on gaps and levels, not the dynamic pace of the economy. “If the potential growth rate is also robust then demand may not be excessively stimulated,” he says. “Even with weak potential growth, if the level of output is a long way below potential, interest rates should be at low levels to stimulate demand back to its potential.”</p>
<p>Rush believes that failure to do this would leave disinflationary spare capacity that could cause a miss of the inflation target: “The value of the dynamic data here is their indications of the gaps and levels that matter, and they do so in a directly observable and less uncertain way than the various bits on the supply side of the Taylor Rule”.</p>
<h4 id=""down-to-business"">Down to business</h4>
<p>Interest rate risk can never be eliminated, and for many businesses, it is very much a centralised risk and must be managed. This can be done with accurate cash flow forecasts (see box), and by reviewing past trends for interest rates over both short and medium terms. It is essential that the risk profile of the company is adhered to, and that other legal requirements and documentation is in place so the proposed strategy can be executed.</p>
<p>Whatever the appetite for risk in any organisation, there are real opportunities for treasurers to earn improved returns on idle or investment cash balances. The ability to understand how any cash investment could be affected by a rising or falling interest rate allows treasurers to take immediate action. This will impact the current and future values of existing cash holdings, as well as influencing the relative attractiveness of different investment proposals.</p>
<p>As referenced in the Treasury Today’s September/October ‘<a href=""/risk-management/credit-and-interest-rate-risk/managing-rising-interest-rates-ttqa"">Question Answered</a>’, there are many different cash investment options available to treasurers, and each one varies significantly in its relationship to interest, and thus its capacity to mitigate risk. Of principal interest to treasurers are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Overnight bank deposits.</strong> Rates offered on overnight bank deposits tend to track interest rates fairly closely. However, given the lessons learnt from the 2007/8 financial crisis, treasurers should always review counterparty credit risk associated with the depositary bank. With some overnight bank deposits, there is also the option of earning credits to offset fees, interest or both.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Time deposits.</strong> These can offer higher yields but tend to catch any rate increase with a lag, as they need to wait out the term of the deposit before being reset to a higher rate. Time deposits carry the same counterparty risk as overnight deposits but there is an increased liquidity risk. However, some minimum maturity time deposits can offer attractive yields and increased liquidity, versus longer term-time deposits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Money market funds.</strong> Compared to overnight bank deposits and time deposits, money market funds (MMFs) have a significantly more diversified counterparty credit risk and yields are in line with market rates.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, in order to better navigate the current interest rate environment, it’s critical for treasurers to design and deploy a robust investment strategy that recognises trade-offs in yield, safety and liquidity.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h4 id=""an-appetite-for-risk"">An appetite for risk?</h4>
<p>These investment options represent some of the most important ways changing interest rates influence demand. Having a solid understanding as to how, why and when they change, allows treasurers to take action to mitigate the impact of any changing interest rate cycle.</p>
<p>In effect, any change to interest rates leads to demand being pulled forward or pushed back, relative to when it might otherwise have occurred. Inflation expectations are also important. If expectations are high, interest rates will also need to be relatively elevated to allow real purchasing power to rise by an attractive amount through deferred consumption.</p>
<p>What today’s treasurer should be more focused on is the risk appetite of the organisation, and just how exposed it should be to any movement in interest rates. This is always a decision made by the board. Working closely with the board, treasurers should come up with an interest rate policy which broadly sets out the balance between fixed and floating interest rates that the business should have at any one time.</p>
<h4 id=""to-fix-or-not-to-fix"">To fix or not to fix?</h4>
<p>At present, and because interest rates are so low, there is a tendency for treasurers to be more floating than fixed. However, this will all depend on the nature of the organisation, depending on the type of the business and just how long it is holding that debt for. If a treasurer is focused on making sure the organisation is compliant with the board’s risk appetite, then it ultimately shouldn’t matter where interest rates are. However, rates should be consistently monitored to see if the risk profile of the company needs changing.</p>
<p>“Any rate cut or hike of 0.25 basis points should not make much of an impact on an organisation’s bottom line; unless of course it is operating right at the edge of its resources,” says Sarah Boyce, Associate Director, Policy and Technical at the Association of Corporate Treasurers (ACT). “Organisations operating in the housebuilding, project finance or aerospace industries typically borrow for the long-term. As a result, a view may be taken that fixing at a low interest rate for 30 years is so much more attractive than a long-term average of 5-7%.”</p>
<p>Equally, Boyce believes that an organisation which borrows on a short-term basis will typically take the view to keep floating because there is a possibility interest rates could fall further. “Should there be any increase in rates the impact won’t be as painful, so it is a much more nuanced question,” she adds.</p>
<p>Jonathan Pryor, Head of FX Sales at Investec agrees. “Short-term movements in interest rates are likely to prompt questions around surplus cash deployment,” he says. “In falling yield markets, treasurers may be considering options around either fixed-term or notice deposits which provide banks with favourable liquidity and therefore attract a higher yield than short-term funds”.</p>
<p>As markets begin to price in expectations of future rate movements into the yield curve, more strategic decisions will be made. Both the UK and US interest rate markets have expectations of cuts in the price of money already priced in, and this presents opportunities.</p>

<h4 id=""the-future"">The future</h4>
<p>The world is ever-changing, and with so much on the geopolitical and economic agenda, it’s very difficult to gain a clear perspective and accurate forecast on when rates may rise. The likelihood of rates rising in 2020 looks limited. The US economic expansion is mature, Eurozone growth is fragile, and inflation is a long way below its desired target.</p>
<p>“There may be idiosyncratic moves in some smaller economies but overall, unless there is a decent pick up in global growth and inflation, or easing of trade tensions and politics, cuts look more likely than increases,” says Paul Mueller, Senior Portfolio Manager at Invesco.</p>
<p>It seems that until inflation picks up, it’s likely that central banks will remain comfortable with current levels, and there could be the implementation of differing forms of quantitative easing such as the ECB’s Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing (TLTRO) operations. To date, banks are currently paying around €7bn per year to the ECB on cash parked there which exceeds mandatory reserves.</p>
<p>Regardless of what happens to interest rates in the coming months, the key question that today’s treasurer needs to ask is: “What will my business look like if interest rates are X%?”. Those businesses with an appropriate interest rate strategy in place will be best placed to respond.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Large organisations often have specialised functions. To give an example, a financial planning and analysis (FP&amp;A) team may not know that the accounting and treasury team are all looking to analyse and measure similar data. As a result, each team may launch a separate project to get a nuanced view of the same data, all with similar objectives. This leads to a competition for the same scarce resources, as they both try to prove that their project is far more important than that of the other.</p>
<p>But the IT team is in a unique place to bring all the teams together and facilitate conversations, such as coming up with a digital/analytics strategy for finance as a whole. Why is this?</p>
<p>Well, the IT team can be a neutral party in all the discussions. Some companies are able to form a centre of excellence reporting to the chief financial officer (CFO) for the same purpose. Unfortunately, in the absence of an owner for any end-to-end processes, inefficiencies will continue to go unnoticed.</p>
<p>As such, treasury needs certain metrics to understand and compare past performance with current and future behaviour. After all, every business spends a lot of time and resources in the hope that it will yield business insights that will drive efficiencies. However, if the data quality is not reliable, all the data stored will not be of much use – especially master data.</p>
<p>But here lies the main question: who owns data governance? The business team? The IT team? Or should it be a centralised or decentralised process?</p>
<p>Because the IT team is naturally connected to several different functions in finance, it can play a crucial role in bringing the relevant stakeholders to the table to help define the data governance framework.</p>
<p>As treasurers, we understand that IT often struggles when it comes to prioritising resources, as their main goal is to optimise existing systems for the organisation as a whole. We understand that balancing the short-term and long-term view is a hard task, but it is ultimately critical. In today’s economic climate, unfortunately the pressures on IT are only going to increase.</p>
<p>For most treasurers, we intuitively know where the inefficiencies lie and we are just as motivated as the IT team to find a solution. But sometimes IT does not have access to all the data needed to make a business case or determine return on investment (ROI). Gathering up this data can indeed be quite a time-consuming task.</p>
<p>The solution is to have someone in the organisation who has access to cross-functional team data and can develop a business case using a standard methodology that will make it easy for IT to come up with an objective way to prioritise projects.</p>
<p>When all is said and done you can’t build a house without a plan. Foundations must be laid and such a large project must be broken up into smaller ones that can be tackled in the right and logical order. But when treasury and IT work together as one, anything is possible.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Treasury is a business-critical function that, at its core, manages a company’s liquidity and financial risks. Requests for IT support must therefore be prioritised and resolved as quickly as possible to avoid the negative consequences that may arise from a system disruption, such as a failure to effectively fund business operations.</p>
<p>The IT support required to ensure the smooth running of treasury operations can be categorised as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Operational support.</strong> The treasury management system (TMS) generates cash forecasts, records and matches market trades, releases high value payments and could easily be described as the beating heart of any treasury – the health of this system is therefore critical. To effectively maintain this system it’s necessary to have competent staff that can provide effective support in line with mutually agreed service terms.</p>
<p>A number of ancillary systems are often required to both feed and receive data via the TMS so it is important that IT understands how our systems interact and the significance that any service disruption might have on the function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Change programmes.</strong> The objective of most treasuries is to achieve straight through processing (STP) such as reducing manual interventions so data and transactions can flow unencumbered through the workstream. Few teams begin with a perfect solution, so achieving a high level of process automation is usually an iterative process that evolves through continuous improvements made over a number of years.</p>
<p>Automating the flow of data, such as bank statements, financial market information and trades, are fundamental objectives when seeking to achieve STP. Support from IT is therefore essential to establish, and occasionally maintain, the multitude of interfaces that facilitate the flow of information between the business and various external stakeholders.</p>
<p>If a business makes the brave choice to implement a new TMS, it is important that IT is involved at inception to ensure that any solution can be properly supported by existing architecture and that in-house support teams can provide first line support should issues arise both during and post implementation.</p>
<p>If IT stakeholders understand the system well enough to develop reports and make simple configuration changes, then the requirement, and cost, associated with ongoing vendor support can be reduced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Business continuity.</strong> It is critically important that treasury has a robust, and frequently tested, continuity plan to ensure that any disruption associated with an unexpected location or system outage can be mitigated. To effectively manage daily operations, treasury requires hardware that facilitates agile working and fast and efficient support should any system accessibility issues arise.</p>
<p>In the past, the provision of a work area recovery facility (WARF) was advisable to ensure that business critical functions, such as treasury, could be maintained during major disruption events. However, with the proliferation of cloud-based SaaS solutions and the welcome drift toward flexible working arrangements, the need for maintaining off-site contingency space has diminished.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, it is important for a treasury team to spend time with its IT partners to ensure that there is a clear understanding between the teams of support requirements and why it is so crucially important that the maintenance of treasury infrastructure is prioritised.</p>

<p>Over the past few years, one of the common themes we have experienced in the execution of our strategy across treasury, is that we can often spend significant time and effort trying to bridge the gap between our requirements and knowledge, and that of our IT functions.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that the products we use in treasury are naturally very specific to our own needs, such as the TMS, dealing portals and rate feeds. As such, these are not widely known about, or indeed even understood outside a very small circle of experts. If your IT department looks to manage and support an application like a TMS in the same generic way that might work for a globally-deployed application, you will naturally run into difficulties.</p>
<p>Over the years, here at AstraZeneca we have worked hard alongside our long-term external technology partner, Covarius, to ensure that our IT teams fully understand what it is that treasury actually does. We wanted to make it 100% clear that our small treasury team has a responsibility to manage all of AstraZeneca’s financial assets – many of which are highly liquid – on a real-time basis.</p>
<p>We were very keen to stress that any system issues or outages would potentially incur significant financial or reputational risk very quickly. After all, nothing focusses the mind of your IT department more than these two risks, so we were adamant that our treasury applications were included in the small suite of applications that are deemed to be ‘Board Level Critical’.</p>
<p>But here at AstraZeneca, our treasury operations continue to invest in our internal relationships, and our proactive approach includes treasury team members visiting our support teams and shared service centres across the globe. This ensures that the importance of treasury and our systems and applications to the financial wellbeing of the company, are clearly understood.</p>
<p>Above all else, communication is key; as is involving IT in the design of our constantly-evolving technology roadmap in order to get support and ‘buy-in’ for our requirements. However, at the same time we have to ensure that our treasury strategy is included in and aligned to the wider longer-term group IT strategies, as that will be a critical factor in the ongoing success of our use of technology.</p>
<p>Having focussed historically on both educating and partnering with our IT department, we now feel we are in a far better place going forwards with regards to the maintenance of our systems, and the ability to continue on our technology journey into the future.</p>
<p>I believe that our relationships with IT, and their understanding of our business will become even more important over the next few years as we start to see newer technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and blockchain coming into the mainstream. As ever, we’ll be looking to the support of IT to ensure we can continue to be early adopters of these technologies as and when they become available.</p>
<p>Close partnership between treasury and IT is key to success.</p>

<p><em>Cost management is vital for every business and for most, setting budgets is based largely on what happened last year. But in the current business environment, where volatility and unpredictability are the watchwords, a more accurate method seems appropriate. We go back to basics with the concept of zero-based budgeting.</em></p>
<p>A 2018 Accenture report showed that over 91% of zero-based budgeting (ZBB) programmes met or exceeded their targets. Before 2011, only 2% of surveyed companies had initiated a ZBB programme but between 2013 and 2017, Accenture notes that ZBB adoption grew by 57% every year amongst the world’s 85 largest companies. ZBB, it seems, has arrived, at least on the big stage.</p>
<p>Does it work? McKinsey reports that “when properly implemented, ZBB can reduce selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) costs by 10% to 25%, often within as little as six months”.</p>
<p>But it is not a silver bullet for cash management difficulties nor is it an easy fix, warns Accenture. Indeed, companies reported some serious obstacles to overcome before finally reaping the rewards: 67% said cultural buy-in was the hardest, followed by change management problems (41%) and the perennial issue of data visibility (33%).</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the key difficulties in getting buy-in is that ZBB is an ongoing process that represents, for some, both a cultural and business process about turn.</p>
<p>Accenture now advocates a far wider use case for the ‘zero-based mind-set’ (or ZBx, as it calls it), with potential, it argues, to tackle the entire P&amp;L, including general and administrative expenses, direct and indirect labour costs, sales and marketing, logistics, and cost of goods sold. For now though, we’ll focus on its original target.</p>
<h4 id=""basics"">Basics</h4>
<p>The ‘zero-based’ concept was the brainchild of Peter Pyhrr, an account manager at US technology firm, Texas Instruments. Pyhrr developed his concept in the 1960s and wrote about his success with it in a 1970 article for the Harvard Business Review. The Accenture report referred to earlier shows that it has since met with favour at many a large corporate and has been advocated for use by small businesses too because of its inherent accuracy.</p>
<p>ZBB requires a company’s income less its expenses to equal zero. In other words, its expenses need to match what comes in during the budgetary period. The idea is that every single unit of currency (euro, pound, dollar, yen, rupee et al) has a well-defined function, so that everything the company spends, saves, gives or invests is equal to that period’s income.</p>
<p>ZBB means there are no balances to be carried forward from prior periods and no expenses that are pre-committed. It is literally a zero-balance for each period. But it is more than just ‘a new budget from scratch’. It is, as McKinsey has argued, a way to “build cultures of cost management throughout the organisation by using a structured approach to facilitate cost visibility, cost governance, cost accountability, and aligned incentives.”</p>
<p>Indeed, by connecting the budgeting processes to the different business functions – production, sales and marketing, logistics and so on – it allows the grouping of diverse cost bases. Current but rather more granular expectations of expenditure across the business can then be analysed, giving a far more strategic view.</p>
<p>The ZBB model is a means of banishing arbitrary and potentially inaccurate and costly blanket increases or decreases over the previous period’s budget. It means that it is now possible to create an accurate and detailed rolling budget over an extended period. Here, reviews can be called from small groups of managers from different functions at different times, rather than imposing them en masse, and still maintain accuracy.</p>
<p>The fundamental process demands a re-evaluation of every line item of a cash flow statement, justifying every expenditure that is to be incurred by each department. Every expense for each new period is thus calculated on the basis of actual expenses that are to be incurred and not the rather less accurate assumption (as is the case with traditional budgeting) that previous incomings and outgoings will continue.</p>
<h4 id=""good-practice"">Good practice</h4>
<p>The idea that arbitrary incremental spending increases over previous budgets is somehow appropriate when costs and market conditions are as volatile as they are today seems wide of the mark. Whereas traditional budgeting seeks to justify only new expenditures, using the last period’s actuals as the template, ZBB wipes the slate clean for each new period.</p>
<p>The main aim of the ZBB model is to lower business unit costs by pinpointing where these can be sensibly cut. By knowing precisely where every dollar (euro, pound, etcetera) is going, the vagaries of the market can be more effectively managed. As McKinsey has pointed out: “A world-class ZBB process is based on developing deep visibility into cost drivers and using that visibility to set aggressive yet credible budget targets.”</p>
<p>The basic principles encourage:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Identifying specific business goals and/or tasks for each function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analysing and developing new ways of achieving these tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exploring new sources of funding for these.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setting the budget numbers and prioritising the direction of funding.</p>
</li>
</ul>


<h3 id=""zbb-in-action-1"">ZBB in action 1</h3>
<p>ZBB requires close and granular scrutiny of all departmental expenses each period. A company making widgets uses this process to identify that the cost of a part that it has been buying in to make these widgets increases by 7% every year. Instead of increasing the budget for this part, and either absorbing the cost or passing it on to the customer, it uses departmental cost analysis to work out that it could make the part for less in-house. Having weighed up the positives and negatives of in-house manufacturing, and the costs of ZBB itself (as a more involved process), it decides to manufacture in-house.</p>
<h4 id=""zbb-in-action-2"">ZBB in action 2</h4>
<p>The budget for a manufacturing unit is set for US$12m. The decision to award this figure is based on a traditional model of last year +10%. All things being equal, management could have used ZBB, whereby the manufacturing budget disregards all previous figures and instead calculates the expected expenses of the unit, then justifies each of these. Once agreed, the figure may turn out to be slightly higher or lower than the incremental model, but either way, the ZBB figure reflects the actual cost for manufacturing to function effectively, neither being wasteful nor underfunding the operation.</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h4 id=""buy-in"">Buy-in</h4>
<p>The creation of a ZBB demands the buy-in and involvement of relevant employees. Department managers need to think about how every dollar (or pound, euro) is spent in every single budgeting period. This requires that they describe and justify all old, recurring and new expenditures before they can be included within a new budgetary period. Only that way, argue ZBB’s proponents, can a business optimise both its costs and revenues.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to the potential over- or under-funding that comes from blanket incremental increases. With traditional budgeting, managers typically need to spend their budgetary allowances in each period to ensure they do not lose it, regardless of need. With ZBB, every expense is accounted for and so there is no loss of budget, only access to what is needed, when it is needed.</p>
<h4 id=""advantages"">Advantages</h4>
<p>Managers must justify all expenses, so it is not an issue if their new budget is higher or lower than the previous one; they will receive what they can justify. Because justified expenditures are in their budgets, ZBB helps to drive the allocation of resources directly toward activities which benefit the organisation most and remove those that offer little or no value.</p>
<p>Here are some further plus points for ZBB:</p>
<p><strong>Improves accuracy:</strong> by ensuring every function revisits every item of its cash flow and calculates its true operational costs, it helps give an accurate set of figures for the whole business in terms of cost versus expected performance.</p>
<p><strong>Drives efficiency:</strong> the ZBB process creates a set of flexible budgets that have at their heart a deep understanding of current costs, and a far more disciplined approach to budget execution and distribution. Allocation of budget and resources need not be based on historical numbers where actuals are available. By using actuals, ZBB aims most resources at activities which generate most revenue and/or are most critical to the survival of the business.</p>
<p><strong>Removes waste:</strong> by seeking repeated justification, ZBB stops any resource being diverted to activities that no longer offer value, either from a risk-reward ratio perspective or from a cost-benefit analysis. This helps to optimise all current activities and avoids wasteful expenditure by wiping out any legacy expenses or misallocation of resources that have crept upwards over time without any real understanding of why these costs are as they are (<a href=""#zbb-in-action-1"">see ZBB in action 1</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Stops budget inflation:</strong> justification of every expenditure counters the inefficiency and waste of incremental budgetary inflation.</p>
<p><strong>Improves co-operation and communication:</strong> McKinsey has said that ZBB “is very detailed, structured, and interactive in order to facilitate meaningful financial debate among managers and executives”.</p>
<p><strong>Encourages innovation:</strong> ZBB encourages managers to be more innovative in how they reduce costs or raise output as they seek to justify their allocation of resources.</p>
<h4 id=""disadvantages"">Disadvantages</h4>
<p><strong>Resource intensive:</strong> the ‘from-scratch’ process that characterises ZBB is its main downside. There is no escaping the fact that it is more time-consuming and resource-intensive than traditional budgeting methods. Indeed, it takes a lot more time and effort to closely review and justify every budget element; building a whole new budget from the ground up could require the input of many more employees.</p>
<p>It may be that certain functions or departments do not have the resources to comply and this will clearly hinder any attempt to deploy ZBB across the organisation. Whether the benefits of ZBB outweigh the far heavier demand on resources than traditional methodologies require is a call that the individual business must make. That said, McKinsey suggests that initial rollout of a new ZBB programme can be led by a central team and completed in four to ten months.</p>
<p><strong>Can promote short-termism:</strong> ZBB is easier to practice within functions generating direct revenues (such as sales) because their contribution is easier to measure, and therefore justify, than indirect sources such as training, customer services and R&amp;D.</p>
<p>By focusing the direction of resources on areas that the company knows will be profitable in the next budgetary period, there is a risk that that longer-term investments, especially those that do not directly deliver revenue (such as the aforementioned training, customer services or R&amp;D), could lose out on budget. Obviously, this would be damaging for the long-term prospects of the business, and thus must be managed.</p>
<p><strong>Exposes lack of expertise:</strong> ZBB requires a qualified professional skillset to undertake and thus demands serious commitment. There will almost certainly be a requirement for training of managers to be able to understand and use the process effectively and extract the most benefit for their respective functions and for the business as a whole.</p>

<h4 id=""is-zbb-a-winner"">Is ZBB a winner?</h4>
<p>ZBB is a means of reflecting the actual expenses that a department may incur in going about its business. It requires time, skill and understanding and the buy-in of managers for it to work. However, it is also a means of creating a rigorous culture of cost management across the enterprise. It can offer what McKinsey describes as “unprecedented cost visibility, a unique governance model, accountability at all levels of the organisation, aligned incentives, and a rigorous and routine process”. If used sensibly, ZBB removes unproductive costs, enabling the business to divert funding to areas that can ensure future growth. In an unpredictable and volatile world, anything that can do that must surely be worthy of consideration.</p>


","Cost management is vital for every business and for most, setting budgets is based largely on what happened last year.

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>Treasurers may not historically have played much of a role in supporting business growth. But in 2019, proactive treasurers are stepping up and taking on a more strategic role within their organisations.</em></p>
<p>Business growth is a goal for many organisations – but companies have plenty of challenges to overcome when contemplating growth in the current market. The Gartner 2019 CEO and Business Executive Survey found that 53% of respondents mentioned growth as a top three business priority, up from 40% in the 2018 survey. But CEOs also referenced the challenges that can arise when expanding internationally, with 23% citing the impact of tariffs, quotas and other trade controls.</p>
<p>While treasurers may not be at the forefront of the company’s growth strategy, they will nevertheless be affected by it. “Growth is driven by investor expectations around margin growth, and that obviously cascades to the CFO and ultimately finds its way – perhaps through a different set of key performance indicators – to the treasury,” says Peter Cunningham, EMEA Head of Consumer &amp; Healthcare Sector, Treasury and Trade Solutions at Citi. “But it’s an ongoing challenge to pursue growth strategies while doing the day job.  And that day job has become a bit more complicated in the current environment – it’s certainly a more volatile outlook in light of factors like geopolitical pressures, trade wars and Brexit.”</p>
<p>Treasury may traditionally have focused on bread-and-butter activities such as cash management, funding and investments. In today’s environment, however, the role of the treasurer has taken on a much more strategic focus – at least for some companies. For example, the ACT’s 2018 report, The Business of Treasury, found that 87% of respondents saw treasury as a strategic business partner in their organisations.</p>
<h4 id=""evolving-role-of-the-treasurer"">Evolving role of the treasurer</h4>
<p>While treasurers have not historically played much of a role in identifying and harnessing opportunities for growth, this is now changing, says Deepali Pendse, head of South East Asia Corporate Sales, Global Transaction Services at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofAML).</p>
<p>Pendse outlines the traditional role of the treasurer as one which has “little autonomy” and is limited to asset liability management and liquidity. Under this model, Pendse says that treasurers tend to focus on activities such as ensuring optimal use of cash, managing financial risk and cash flow forecasting – adding that this role is overall “more operational centric”.</p>
<p>Today, in contrast, Pendse notes that treasurers now have greater autonomy, coupled with local decision-making power. “They are involved in the impact of regulatory changes, implications of capital adequacy and risk management,” she adds. “They are also required to collaborate with various units within the business and advise senior management – and they are heavily involved in capital allocation decisions.”</p>
<h4 id=""commercial-treasury"">Commercial treasury</h4>
<p>Cunningham says that “the treasurer is not the first person you’d think of as enabling growth within the treasury” – but he also notes that the treasury’s role in supporting growth is changing. “In the last five years I’ve seen the emergence of new roles and titles within treasury, such as ‘treasury advisory’ or ‘commercial treasury’,” he explains. “Effectively, the remit of these roles is to come out of the silo of treasury and engage with the business.”</p>
<p>He adds this can also be achieved via senior secondments between different departments. “So a treasury person might sit and work in the procurement division or the credit control department for 12 months. While the focus of these exercises may not be specifically on growth, it’s certainly about looking at what value-add treasury can generate for the business, and what it can contribute to the company beyond risk mitigation and optimal funding models.”</p>
<h4 id=""why-step-up"">Why step up?</h4>
<p>There are many reasons why treasurers might want to embrace a more strategic role within their organisations. Career progression is one compelling motivator. “What is the next role for the treasurer?” says David Stebbings, Director, Head of Treasury Advisory at PwC. “It’s either another treasury role in another company, or to be CFO – or another financial management position with a wider remit. And if you want to be a CFO, you have to step up.”</p>
<p>In other cases, external factors can facilitate a shift into a more strategic role. This can include market developments which underline the importance of the treasurer’s expertise – such as the global financial crisis or, more recently, Brexit and the US-China trade war. The trajectory of an individual company can also demand greater input from the treasury.</p>
<p>“As companies become more global, foreign exchange becomes more important and banking arrangements can become more difficult – so the treasurer has a bigger role to play in all that,” says Stebbings. “Of course, some don’t want to. Some are quite happy to do the traditional treasurer role, and then potentially move into tax.”</p>
<p>That said, Stebbings also observes that a traditional approach is more viable in some companies than in others. “It is much riskier now to be inward-looking and focused on technical treasury,” he says. “In businesses that are growing internationally, you are more likely to succeed with a business-focused approach – but you still need to get the basic transactional and funding elements right as well.”</p>
<h4 id=""how-can-treasurers-support-growth"">How can treasurers support growth?</h4>
<p>What does this mean in practice? Stebbings highlights a number of areas in which treasurers can support business growth: “The treasurer has a significant role to play when it comes to expanding the global footprint of the business,” he explains. “Not just by setting up cash management arrangements, but also by understanding the foreign exchange.” He argues that FX is as much a business issue as it is a treasury issue – and that treasurers increasingly need to get involved with issues such as the impact of FX risk on pricing contracts with contracts and suppliers.</p>
<p>Stebbings adds that treasurers can also support growth in other key areas, for example by negotiating arrangements for credit card receipts, or by supporting suppliers through the use of supply chain finance.</p>
<h4 id=""working-capital-and-beyond"">Working capital and beyond</h4>
<p>Working capital management is another notable component of supporting business growth, as Daniel Jefferies, Group Treasurer at Equiniti Group, explains. “This includes asking what the working capital requirements are for the business – are you cash generative? Do you have highly cyclical cash flows? What is the best way to support that in the business?” he says.</p>
<p>In addition, Jefferies includes activities such as capital structure and funding under the heading of supporting growth. “It’s also about taking risk out of the business, and allowing the business to do what it does best,” he says, citing a role at another company where he had used hedging and risk management to take away risk and volatility from the company’s products.</p>
<p>But while there are many ways in which treasury can support growth and take on a more strategic role, this doesn’t mean that treasury can or should be leading the company in this area. As Jefferies remarks, “You are not there to set the organisational strategy, but you are there to support it.”</p>
<h4 id=""advising-on-e-commerce"">Advising on e-commerce</h4>
<p>Citi’s Cunningham says another area of opportunity is the value that treasurers can provide when companies are developing their e-commerce strategies. While such strategies tend to be driven by the consumer payments team, with a focus on enabling the company to connect directly with consumers, Cunningham notes that there is much to be gained by looking at this topic through a treasury lens.</p>
<p>“When a consumer or FMCG company sells direct to the end consumer, there’s theoretically more margin to capture because you are cutting out the middleman,” says Cunningham. “But the big upside that isn’t appreciated by many companies is that there’s a huge working capital opportunity here.”</p>
<p>He points out that FMCG companies may have a DSO of 50-60 days – “but when you collect at point of sale, that DSO becomes effectively zero. So there’s a clear opportunity to be captured as you push more sales through that direct to consumer channel – but it also explodes the volumes of sales and collections you have, with the average transaction value coming down significantly.”</p>
<p>As Cunningham explains, the higher volume of transactions can wreak havoc and create bottlenecks if processes are not fully automated “so there are some interesting opportunities and costs that need to be addressed. I feel that treasury should have a seat at the table here, but from the discussions I’m having, that’s not really happening today.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Cunningham says that there are some cases where treasury is becoming more engaged in this area. He cites the example of a company where the treasurer is working directly with web designers to incentivise desired consumer behaviour during the checkout process.</p>
<h4 id=""leveraging-evolving-technology"">Leveraging evolving technology</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, BofAML’s Pendse notes the importance of leveraging technology to drive treasury process automation and “free up staff to focus on strategic, value-added work”. She adds that obstacles to this may include a lack of budget for treasury infrastructure, or for transitioning from process-based treasury to a more strategic approach, noting that some changes in staff may be needed.</p>
<p>Likewise, Pendse says that treasurers can support business growth by leveraging evolving technologies such as AI and API. “The future is data, and how to manage and leverage it for better commercial outcomes,” she says. “What developing stories can a treasurer see from harnessing the data within treasury? Better forecasting, more efficient hedging strategies, lower cost funding.” Nevertheless, she also points out that the obstacles to leveraging these technologies can be considerable, such as having data in multiple systems and issues around the consistency of data.</p>
<h4 id=""stepping-up"">Stepping up</h4>
<p>Treasurers are busy people – and not everyone has the time or inclination to seek out a more active role in supporting business growth.</p>
<p>“It takes a certain type of treasurer who is able to reach out of his or her career domain and work with other business management for the benefit of the business,” says Stebbings. “And this can be difficult to do – procurement might see supply chain finance as their area, for example. So you can get a certain amount of pushback when you are entering someone else’s domain.”</p>
<p>For treasurers who are looking to step up, Jefferies underlines the importance of taking a proactive approach. “You should definitely be prepared to offer your views to your line manager, or to the CFO, and ask, ‘how do you see things progressing over time, and how best can I support you?’” he says. “This might involve asking questions about the capital structure and proposed future actions, and then saying, ‘in that case, do you want me to think about options for funding or risk management?’ Or on a more basic level, it might mean making sure you have the right structure in place to support future activities. I would always encourage having that conversation.”</p>
<p>Dessing, meanwhile, warns that treasurers cannot support growth simply by sitting behind the PC. He adds that treasurers need to have certain characteristics in order to play the part of a strategic partner, including some of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Be prompt.</strong> Dessing says that treasurers need to stay ahead of the curve, rather than waiting for the moment that cash is actually needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be proactive.</strong> This includes connecting with internal and external groups, such as business units, tax, accounting, legal, communication, IR, advisors, auditors and banks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be a team player.</strong> Being a strategic partner means being open and connected, as well as an effective communicator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be the ‘guarder of cash’.</strong> Dessing notes that in today’s digital environment, treasurers should drive “awareness of fraud risk and the associated proper behaviour”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be open minded.</strong> Rather than focusing narrowly on bank account management and cash, Dessing says treasurers should have a holistic role with a wide range of responsibilities and covering areas such as financial and operational risks, pensions and real estate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be passionate.</strong> Last but not least, Dessing advises treasurers need a “best in class mentality” so they can “deliver the value-add” – and he also emphasises the importance of being supportive of others’ ideas.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=""supporting-high-growth-companies"">Supporting high-growth companies</h4>
<p>Supporting growth is one thing – but what challenges might treasurers face when supporting high-growth companies? Cunningham notes that in such cases, there can be a lot of pressure to be first to market and build sticky relationships – particularly if the company is offering a unique proposition.</p>
<p>“From a treasury and finance perspective, that focus on speed can trump safety and soundness – and there are a lot of areas that treasury would traditionally look at when the company enters a new market, such as currency controls, banking regulations and the due diligence that treasury would undertake in a slower life cycle,” he says. “Then there’s the need to choose the right cash management or treasury infrastructure to support the underlying business model in that market.”</p>
<p>In a fast-growing company, Cunningham says that treasurers may not have the luxury of going through the same level of due diligence – and this may force treasurers to approach the exercise slightly differently. “So it might mean you don’t establish local legal entities in that market, or a resident bank account, or a local currency account. Within the confines of local regulations, there may be easier, lighter ways to enter a market that might not be 100% optimised from a cost and risk management perspective – but they can enable you to plant that flag in the market very quickly, and potentially review the infrastructure at a later date.”</p>

<p>George Dessing is Executive Vice President Treasury &amp; Risk at Wolters Kluwer, which provides professional information, software solutions and services for a number of sectors, including health, tax and accounting, risk and compliance, and legal and regulatory.</p>
<p>As Dessing explains, the treasury plays a business partner role when it comes to supporting the company’s new 2019-2021 strategy, ‘Accelerating Our Value’. He comments, “Treasurers need to support growth by freeing up business unit finance directors to move away from day-to-day cash management and banking related issues, and focus on their organic growth and driving the business.”</p>
<p>He says that with increasing pressure to operate efficiently, it’s critical for treasury to “identify opportunities that will drive operational and financial agility”, therefore supporting more investment into innovation and product development. According to Dessing, treasury can do this in three ways: “Be the knowledge centre; be the enabler for cost saving; be the arranger for alignment of the finance terms and conditions.”</p>
<p>Dessing says he supports business growth at Wolters Kluwer in a number of different ways. These include centralising and optimising cash management and treasury processes, as well as rationalising banks and banking fees. In addition, he says that treasury is playing a role in streamlining e-commerce by aligning and optimising the company’s credit card programme and rolling out new cards in order to increase standardisation. Other practical measures include driving fraud prevention and being the ‘go-to’ department “for funding to execute the strategic plans supporting our growth.”</p>

<p>The bread and butter issues, and the outcomes (for example improving business cash flow, capital effectiveness and efficiency, and margins) differentiating good from poor business operations have not shifted.</p>
<p>The shift is in the speed and magnitude of change in the different enablers that support effective business operations, and these factors have made staying afloat dicier.</p>
<p>Changes in the geo-political, business and regulatory environments, exacerbated by the rapid and frequent disruptions in technological advancements, have increased the urgency for business operations to act. It has become crucial for companies to have a strategic roadmap of how they would invest and deploy appropriate technology to make sense of the business environment, identify opportunities and manage results.</p>
<p>It seems like only yesterday that many companies shunned being the first adopters of technology for reasons such as fear of change, and fear of failure. Back then, the punitive costs of being an early adopter (be it financial or non-financial) were also prohibitive in many cases.</p>
<p>Today, technology options and delivery platform choices are aplenty, and they cater to different budgets, scale of operations and complexity. New systems, artificial intelligence (AI) and automated processes can increase the processing and analytical bandwidth of corporations and provide platforms for sizing up opportunities in the marketplace.</p>
<p>For the treasurer, the entrepreneurial push towards successful adoption of the right technology could free up valuable manpower that can then be deployed to identify new areas of market growth for the company, and to develop strategic/tactical plans to manage treasury risks. Treasurers can consider actioning a number of initiatives to help identify and manage growth and investing opportunities. They include treasury management systems to provide the organisation with visibility and transparency over its financial resources and commitments and risks associated with them that will need managing. Electronic dealing, confirmation and settlement is a value enhancing add-on that provides the straight-through process for funding and risk management operations while standardising trading operations. Adoption of BOTs and robotic processing applications (RPAs), meanwhile, can help increase efficiency in data gathering, reporting and analytics.</p>
<p>Firms can also look to leverage the scale and reach of core banking relationships to enhance support for existing business operations while providing outreach to new business areas in different geographies.</p>
<p>As with all investments in an organisation, it is imperative for the treasurer to build a credible and achievable business plan. A plan that has clear objectives, timelines, return on investment and payback period will improve the odds for management and business buy-in, and provide the financial and non-financial resources for the work ahead.</p>
<p>The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. The treasurer’s first step would be to take stock of where the organisation is and where it could be. The next steps following the assessment is where the treasurer’s business entrepreneurship comes in.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>In order to help their organisations navigate today’s challenging macro conditions and shifting treasury landscape, treasurers need to be prepared to be more entrepreneurial. A key part of that is to leverage people, innovation and best of breed technology to find an incremental edge.</p>
<p>Technology in particular has moved from being an enabler to being a driver of change and, as the global marketplace changes, business models and operations need to adapt to remain competitive. This is especially true in Asia where the different markets, languages and regulations create a unique set of challenges.</p>
<p>We see three major areas that will impact a treasurer’s ability to be more entrepreneurial and help firms explore and capture new opportunities. On the technology front, building a coherent and optimised technology strategy is key but takes planning and foresight, a keen understanding of current technologies, and, more importantly, anticipating how technologies may evolve. Indeed “TreasuryTech” is now developing so quickly that not adopting new technology will negatively impact treasurers’ ability to manage risk, and capture opportunities. The real risk comes from not taking action in areas such as cloud for treasury applications, integration of multiple applications, management of master reference data and dashboard reporting applications.</p>
<p>Another big challenge for treasurers is leveraging data to identify emerging trends across global treasury operations, moving from reactive treasury management towards pro-active management across liquidity, financial risk management, investments, funding and working capital. Information harnessed from data provides treasurers with useful insights and enables them to optimise flows and capture new opportunities. Typically, we see treasurers focusing on data solutions related to cash flow forecasting, cash pooling, consolidated reporting, dashboards and real-time reporting. Even something as simple as automating the receipt of electronic bank statements can improve a treasurer’s visibility over their cash position and enhance efficiency.</p>
<p>More broadly, there is the need to embrace disruption: stand out treasuries seek to drive a revolutionary spirit within their own teams, encourage team members to challenge processes and ways of doing business with a focus on collaboration across the organisation. In order to disrupt and innovate in a rapid test-and-learn fashion, organisations should seek to partner with banks and other advisors to develop digital solutions that are globally consistent and locally relevant.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, treasurers also need to stay informed on a number of emerging technology areas even if their commercial applications are still evolving. These include distributed ledger technologies (blockchain, tokenisation) across areas such as payments, trade finance and working capital management; and AI going beyond robotic process automation into cognitive intelligence.</p>
<p>Underpinning all of this is of course one of the most important assets a treasury has – its people. People will be critical in driving change and partnering with the business to formulate a corporate wide approach to explore and capture new growth and investment opportunities.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>VUCA, short for volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity, is becoming a trendy managerial acronym and while it may be trying a little too hard to become just that, it does have the merit of pithily summing up the key challenges confronting treasurers.</p>
<p>In this VUCA world challenges and surprises for treasurers have become the norm and with an entrepreneurial mindset I believe we can also leverage them to yield opportunities and add value for our firms. In the VUCA world treasurers who are agile and smart enough to keep pace with the change can really help their organisations grab opportunities.</p>
<p>Treasury functions are often global and handle a substantial portion of a group’s worldwide balance sheet. One wrong decision or failure to act in a decisive and timely fashion can destroy a group’s profitability and undermine its status in the eye of investors.</p>
<p>As custodians of their company’s fund and shareholders’ interest, treasuries now, perhaps more than ever, need to act as an entrepreneur force within the organisation. As such the treasury teams can support the wider business by identifying opportunities for novel investments, acquisitions, and leveraging offshoring models more effectively.</p>
<p>The development of the VUCA world we now have to contend with can be traced back to the 2008 financial crisis, the subsequent Eurozone debt crisis and through to more recent economic events. All have contributed to challenges confronting treasurers today. Coupled with the rising cost of capital, governance and risk profiling treasurers’ responsibilities and strategic roles have been transformed significantly. Their unprecedented access to boardrooms nowadays is an indication of the scale of the transformation in their role.</p>
<p>In the VUCA world treasurers needs to move on from just dealing with numbers, finances and compliance to actively collaborating with the wider business to add value. As entrepreneurial treasurers, their remit is broader, more demanding and will almost certainly require the learning of new skills.</p>
<p>In adding value for the wider business, the entrepreneurial treasurer has to “enable, enhance and engender”. Ensuring visibility and control of cash positions; eliminating unproductive working capital; negotiating global funding lines with relationship banks/financial institutions; counterparty risk management; managing sovereign difficulties and associated regulatory uncertainty; and revising and applying improved corporate governance and policy control are among the key responsibilities.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest challenge though will be changing mindset with regards to technology. That means justifying to the wider group the need for investment in automation. It will also require keeping an eye on developments with AI and blockchain and upgrading technological skill set and know-how.</p>
<p>There is however no one way for developing treasury as an entrepreneurial force within an organisation. It can be accomplished in a variety of ways and to a variety of degrees, depending on how a corporate wishes to target its business segments.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>With M&amp;A volumes continuing at a high level, what role can corporate treasurers play in supporting the process – and where are the opportunities to add value?</em></p>
<p>The global M&amp;A boom continues. Last year saw deals worth over US$3trn finalised – and the first quarter of 2018 brought the strongest ever start to the year, with deals totalling over US$1.2trn. Significant deals have included Bayer’s US$63bn acquisition of Monsanto.</p>
<p>“The market is extremely buoyant – and frankly, more buoyant than anyone expected going into 2018,” says Richard King, co-head of Global Corporate &amp; Investment Banking, UK at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofAML). He notes that as well as strong volumes, the current market is also characterised by much larger transaction sizes, with numerous deals exceeding US$10bn announced in recent months.</p>
<p>Vincent Couche, Asia Sales Sector Head of Industrials for TTS at Citi, says that a number of factors are currently driving growth in M&amp;A. “Financing is very cheap compared to historical averages, which makes many deals attractive,” he observes. “And the fact that the economy has slowed down globally has also created opportunities for companies to grow by buying market share.” He adds that some companies are looking to diversify their portfolios and balance their businesses across various industry lines, while some are selling down certain activities so that they can concentrate on others.</p>
<p>Of course, not all M&amp;A deals are a roaring success. Figures published in June by Willis Towers Watson in partnership with Cass Business School revealed that quarterly global M&amp;A performance – measured in terms of the acquiring company’s share price performance – was the lowest in Q2 since records began ten years ago. Given this caveat, what role can corporate treasurers play in making sure any acquisitions result in the desired outcome?</p>
<h3 id=""role-of-the-treasurer"">Role of the treasurer</h3>
<p>For companies embarking on M&amp;A activity, there is much to consider – and treasurers have an increasingly important role to play in that process. King points out that as a highly strategic area, M&amp;A starts and finishes with the CEO and the Board – but that the treasury team and group treasurer are very much part of a company’s M&amp;A team. He notes that since the financial crisis brought the importance of treasury into the spotlight, “treasurers now get involved at a much earlier stage of the M&amp;A process than they might have done ten-15 years ago. In most cases today, they are brought in well before the transaction has been confirmed as definitely going ahead, to help with integration and synergy planning from a treasury perspective, and funding/risk management strategies.”</p>
<p>As such, there are four areas of M&amp;A in which treasurers can play an important role: by supporting the due diligence that happens before the deal; financing the deal; settling the deal – and integrating the new acquisition into the company after the deal has been completed.</p>
<h4 id=""before-the-deal"">Before the deal</h4>
<p>Couche points out that treasurers have a role to play at the earliest stage of the process, when the focus is on understanding the target’s shareholding structure – but “unfortunately they are not always engaged at that point”. As such, he says that treasurers should be proactive in stepping up and getting involved in this part of the process – “Don’t wait to be asked”.</p>
<p>In some cases, treasurers can play a role at the very earliest stages of the M&amp;A process by advising on the implications of different locations from the perspective of currency controls, FX risk and trapped cash. “If the opportunity were to involve multiple jurisdictions, the treasurer would be able to identify optimal sources of financing and trading to minimise FX and other market price risks to advantage the M&amp;A’s operations and integration within any existing operating model,” says Fulvio Barbuio, Board Director of the Finance and Treasury Association (FTA) in Australia and the former Head of Corporate Treasury &amp; Risk at Australian Broadcasting Corporation. “This would also require the treasurer to integrate cash management and ongoing operational funding for the changed entity.”</p>
<p>Global information, software, and services company Wolters Kluwer has carried out M&amp;A to the tune of roughly €200m-€300m per year since 2010, with recent acquisitions including last year’s purchase of Tagetik, provider of corporate performance management solutions, for €300m. “Getting involved as early as possible in the game is essential,” says George Dessing, Senior Vice President, Treasury &amp; Risk. “It depends a bit on how large the deal is, but treasurers always need to stay close to the implications of a deal on leverage or debt levels; the discussions with banks and credit agencies and questions around valuation.” He adds, “The real question is, ‘do we actually get value for our money?’”</p>
<h4 id=""financing"">Financing</h4>
<p>Naturally, one of the most important areas is that of financing. “The traditional role of the treasurer is in raising the financing to enable an acquisition or to manage debt,” says David Stebbings, Director, Head of Treasury Advisory at PwC. He points out that this can be a complex activity, depending on the scale of the deal and the geographies involved. “For example, if you’re in the UK and you’re buying something in the United States, do you borrow in the UK or in the US?”</p>
<p>Barbuio says that first and foremost, treasurers formulate “a financing plan aligned to the strategic plan which identifies sources of funding (both internal and external) available to the organisation giving it flexibility, diversity, capacity and cost effectiveness.” He explains that once a specific M&amp;A deal has been identified, the treasurer can tailor financing from these sources that best matches the M&amp;A in terms of factors such as source, structure, timing, drawdowns, repayments and refinancing.</p>
<p>“This would take into account any leverage, WACC, credit rating and risk management implications for the organisation which would have a bearing on its enterprise value, something it seeks to maximise for its shareholders and broader stakeholders,” he comments.</p>
<h4 id=""settling-the-deal"">Settling the deal</h4>
<p>When it comes to the settlement day, much will depend on how well the company has prepared beforehand. “If you haven’t prepared, your payments could be blocked because your financing line isn’t large enough,” warns Citi’s Couche. “If the payment doesn’t go through, you could miss the cut-off. It’s really about being very transparent with banking and technical partners – and with the target you’re acquiring – about how things are going to work.”</p>
<p>It’s also important to be aware of any practical obstacles that could prevent settlement from taking place. For example, Couche points out that clearing houses in the United States can only clear a maximum of US$10bn in one transaction, which can result in obstacles where mega mergers are concerned.</p>

<h5> </h5>
<h5>How would you describe the treasurer’s role in M&amp;A?</h5>
<p>The role of the treasurer is critical, particularly in large deals, where choosing the right acquisition financing strategy will have a long-term impact in credit ratings, debt covenants, financial synergies, and liquidity. The treasurer not only advises the CFO on M&amp;A capital structure but also executes on the financing and payment of the acquisition. A treasurer’s M&amp;A financing experience will be especially valuable in challenging economic conditions and cross-border deals.</p>
<h5>What involvement have you had in M&amp;A?</h5>
<p>Depending on the acquisition, my involvement has ranged from planning the financing strategy to integrating cash management systems and operations. One thing I learned from my prior years in private equity is not to underestimate the general view that every acquisition is different and unique. That forces me to prioritise on customising the M&amp;A process over spending too much time on a template of due diligence questions. While most principles for treasury M&amp;A are the same, the focus on a “unique process” for a “unique deal” is very useful to anticipate issues and allocate the right resources upfront.</p>
<h5>How have you added-value to the process?</h5>
<p>Treasury can add significant value by managing the FX risk of cross-border M&amp;A deals, especially during periods of financial volatility. For example, I have protected the cash value of multibillion dollar deals by hedging the acquisition payment against FX fluctuations between the time of signing and closing. A proactive post-integration FX hedging plan is also important since FX exposures may be unintentionally created during the transition of the target’s balance sheet into the buyer’s balance sheet.</p>
<h5>What challenges did you need to overcome?</h5>
<p>The main challenge to overcome is having limited information during the due diligence that could later complicate integration activities. To deal with this potential issue it is helpful to complement the data room with a couple of pre-closing meetings with the target. This could be arranged in a way not to overwhelm the target’s team with unnecessary requests.</p>
<h5>How important is it for treasurers to take a proactive approach where M&amp;A is concerned?</h5>
<p>It is important to get involved early in the M&amp;A process because it takes planning and coordination to avoid potential liquidity issues post-closing. This upfront planning is also needed for the design of contingency plans, especially if there are critical dependencies for closing, such as securing debt financing.</p>
<h5>What advice would you give to other treasurers when getting involved with M&amp;A for the first time?</h5>
<p>Regardless of the deal’s dynamics and competing M&amp;A priorities, treasury’s number one objective for day one should always be having full control and visibility of the target’s cash. This will minimise the risk of business disruption, potential fraud, investment losses, and liquidity and credit issues. Securing the cash on day one should be prime responsibility for any treasurer.</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h4 id=""integrating-the-new-business"">Integrating the new business</h4>
<p>Settling the deal isn’t the end of the story and integrating a new acquisition into the existing company takes time and planning. “Treasurers need to consider how they will integrate the new business into their cash management, FX management and banking structures,” says Stebbings. “Or if they are demerging part of the entity, they will need to consider how they set up a separate treasury function for it, including the systems and operational aspects.”</p>


<blockquote>It’s important to integrate quickly, but it can take a month or two to open up new accounts and integrate the payments and hedging processes. Having visibility over cash flows should be the number one priority.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">Vincent Couche, Asia Sales Sector Head of Industrials for TTS, Citi</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>In practice, the integration process cannot be done and dusted on day one but will need to be managed over a period of time. For example, essential tasks will need to be completed on the day of completion, such as updating bank account signers when necessary and putting in place the required sweeping and funding mechanisms. Other tasks can be scheduled in the following weeks or months, from training staff who have joined from the acquired company to rationalising the number of bank relationships and bank accounts. Further down the line, treasurers may then begin to look at integrating their treasury systems and centralisation structures.</p>
<p>“The number one goal is to ensure the continuity of business,” explains Couche. “It’s important to integrate quickly, but it can take a month or two to open up new accounts and integrate the payments and hedging processes. Having visibility over cash flows should be the number one priority.”</p>
<h3 id=""the-ingredients-of-success"">The ingredients of success</h3>
<p>So what should treasurers bear in mind when playing a role in M&amp;A? For one thing, it’s important to pay close attention to timings and to make sure the necessary resources are available when needed. However, this isn’t always straightforward: BofAML’s King says that there is a certain amount of ebb and flow during the M&amp;A process. “Deals can go quiet for weeks or months, and then become extremely busy,” he explains. “Once the price has been agreed, everything will need to be done in a matter of days – so managing resourcing within the treasury team is not an easy matter.”</p>
<p>Also essential is a treasurer’s ability to communicate effectively with other parties involved in the process. Barbuio says that in order to deliver on M&amp;A objectives, a treasurer needs to be a strong communicator and influencer, both with internal stakeholders and with external advisors. “This would require strong and highly developed commercial and soft skills, with the treasury/analytical skills being a given,” he comments.</p>
<p>Dessing also notes the importance of teamwork where M&amp;A is concerned. “We have to make sure that we are in close discussion with the M&amp;A deal team leading the transactions from the beginning,” he says. “You also have to make sure that the interconnection between finance, accounting, legal and tax teams is secured. Likewise, investor relations has to know how the external world will react to certain M&amp;A deals. So I would say it’s truly a team play. In treasury you cannot simply sit behind your PC – you need to literally walk around and make sure you have the right information.”</p>
<p>Finally, Dessing says it is important to have a team which has a can-do attitude and be mindful of the energy that is needed during the M&amp;A process. “At the end of the day, buying new companies is fun and exciting, but it’s also time consuming, requires a lot of energy – and is always pretty urgent,” he says. “So you can’t just say you are out of the office for a couple of days, because the transaction still needs to go ahead.”</p>


<h2 class=""h3 copy__heading"">Planning for success</h2>

<p>Bank of America Merrill Lynch suggests that treasurers ask the following questions in order to plan for success when undertaking mergers, acquisitions and divestitures (MA&amp;D):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Have appropriate controls been put in place for compliance, audit and risk management?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have you established a cash monitoring and funding process to ensure cash visibility and control?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you understand the regulatory, tax, treasury practices and instruments in the new geographies where the NewCo will operate?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Would you replicate the current setup for a carve out, or would you look to take advantage of opportunistic redesign?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How will you accommodate the differing investment grade and liquidity needs of the NewCo?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you see opportunities for treasury enhancements for the NewCo?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does treasury have full access to resources needed to integrate the acquired company?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is MA&amp;D part of your core group strategy? What is the role played by your treasury in MA&amp;D events?</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>Doing more with less is the often-heard mantra of most business functions. How can a professional treasury be run on a tight budget?</em></p>
<p> Every organisation is duty bound to find better ways of operating. Quite often the need is to reduce headcount and costs. The phrase ‘doing more with less’ has entered into the common lexicon of professionals but how easy is this to achieve? Indeed, given the strategic value of some functions – notably treasury – is it even wise to operate on a budget?</p>
<p>The truth is that it depends on the size and complexity of the business. The human factor must also be added in to account for the individual treasurer’s background, areas of interest and expertise. Because of these variables, there can only ever be a relative notion of how efficiently a treasury is being run.</p>
<p>All of this suggests that driving efficiency and ‘doing more with less’ is not an easy matter to tackle. For Sebastian di Paola, PwC’s Global Leader of Corporate Treasury, “increasing treasury efficiency depends considerably on the extent to which the department has invested in technology”.</p>
<p>Treasuries that have the technological vision, and that can gain the support of senior management for its deployment, will be at an advantage, he argues. Those that are not in this position are very likely to experience “a proliferation of manual processes” to cope with the expanding remit of today’s strategic treasury.</p>
<h3 id=""same-issues-smaller-budget"">Same issues, smaller budget</h3>
<p>The level of complexity and treasury requirements in a mid-sized or even small but international business are almost on a par with those of a reasonably ‘homogenous’ multinational. The mid-cap treasurer has to deal with the same set of issues but typically on a much smaller budget.</p>
<p>To deliver in an international environment – with FX exposures, cross-border flows, bank accounts in multiple countries et al – it is too big an ask to automate and run on a basic accounting package. And where there is M&amp;A activity, the proper integration of businesses becomes almost untenable because, in treasury terms, without a robust treasury solution in place, there is nothing into which the acquisition can be integrated.</p>


<blockquote>Increasing treasury efficiency depends considerably on the extent to which the department has invested in technology.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">Sebastian di Paola, Global Leader of Corporate Treasury, PwC</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The argument for having a specialist TMS, or treasury module of an
ERP, is therefore rather compelling for the complex organisation. Whilst
it seems counterintuitive to spend to make savings, without this
investment, treasuries under pressure to operate on reduced headcount
will struggle.</p>
<p>Paring back treasury too far could even intensify risk exposure as it
becomes increasingly difficult for the organisation to apply an
appropriate level of segregation of duties, for example. Offsetting
increasing risks, especially given the current increased corporate
sensitivity to internal controls, may then force the downstream
proliferation of manual back office operations and processes.</p>
<p>Indeed, a common method of achieving this, notes di Paola, is to call
upon the accounting department to fulfil back office duties such as
confirmation matching. Whilst this creates a separate reporting line, it
merely displaces the problem elsewhere, and to a function that is not
necessarily well-versed in the treasury specialism. Doing so could
introduce yet more inefficiencies and risks.</p>
<h3 id=""building-a-business-case"">Building a business case</h3>
<p>The desire to make treasury lean rarely starts with the notion that
the function is oversized, says Paul Taylor, Global Head of Corporate
Sales, GTS and Head of Sales for GTS EMEA, Bank of America Merrill
Lynch. Instead, efficiency is often derived from digitisation, the
removal of manual and paper-based processes and ensuring proper
visibility of data.</p>
<p>With the common view that many companies are operating on a
“patchwork quilt” of technologies, often thrown together through
mergers, Taylor argues that the main barrier to treasury efficiency
often relates to that ‘post-integration’ set-up. But change is afoot. He
believes that “there is so much that can be simplified and refined”.
The evolution of treasury is “naturally lending itself to greater
process and cost efficiency”.</p>
<p>Structuring a leaner treasury function is therefore a matter of first
mapping every financial process, workflow and touch-point. This
end-to-end view (even if it is fragmented) will inform the plan of
action. But it will also call out the “mandatory from the obsolete”,
says Taylor.</p>
<p>Armed with self-knowledge and an action plan for efficiency, treasury
now has to develop a convincing business case for the investment
required to rationalise and integrate that fragmented infrastructure.</p>
<p>There are many options. A ‘one system’ approach may, for example,
yield greater efficiency through automation of labour-intensive manual
process. From document management and KYC, to cash forecasting and
reporting, ideas of robotic process automation and the use of artificial
intelligence to manage workflows are much in evidence in treasury
conversations today (if not yet in treasury practice).</p>
<p>These new ideas may be deemed fanciful. But, advises Taylor, “the
more technology can be harnessed to digitise processes, the greater the
efficiency will be for treasury, and the bigger the gains for the
business”.</p>
<p>If, as it seems, investment is necessary, asking hands outstretched
for ‘more’ when less is called for will be a challenge. It helps that
with the ready availability and relative ease of implementation of
Software-as-a-Service (or cloud) solutions, running the basic
functionality of a TMS is cheaper than when an installed solution was
the only option.</p>
<p>Even in today’s consolidated treasury technology market, the
competitive edge amongst vendors is still evident, says di Paola. The
larger players, with a stable of acquisitions, have to differentiate who
they are aiming their products at. And that, he says, has a positive
impact on pricing for the customer. “It is still possible to get
something that would easily make the business case fly.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, as treasury makes its contribution in areas such as
improved cost of capital, more efficient working capital management, and
improved FX management, Taylor makes the further point that it starts
to become, if not exactly a profit centre, then at least “a generator of
value”.</p>
<p>Despite the number of quantitative and qualitative benefits (and
improvements to organisational health) potentially derived from lean
treasury, resistance to investment is still found, notes di Paola.
Overcoming this depends to an extent on whether the CFO is
treasury-minded or not.</p>
<p>Coming from a treasury background, or at least having had significant
exposure to treasury, would usually encourage in the CFO a degree of
sympathy and understanding for the value of treasury. Making investments
in its delivery of strategic value to the wider business should, in
theory, be an easier ‘sell’. Conversely, resistance from a CFO without a
treasury background suggests the value of treasury is not being
sufficiently well articulated. It is down to the treasurer to do just
that.</p>

<p class=""management-summary"">Some enterprising treasury professionals
have a very hands-on approach to the ‘more with less’ conundrum. Kirsty
Dent, Treasury Analyst at Brisbane Airport Corporation (BAC) sees much
value in knowledge of computer coding. She is versed in Visual Basic for
Applications (VBA) – the programming language of Microsoft Excel. This
has enabled her to save several days effort per month by automating
several manual tasks.</p>
<p>Her most recent effort has been the development of a macro for
creating, saving and sending payment notices to BAC’s bond holders.
“This macro was designed to remove any human intervention from an
important but repetitive process,” explains Dent. “Doing so has saved
the team up to two full working days per month. It’s a good return on
the few hours it took me to write the code.”</p>
<p>Dent always ensures that another person within the treasury team
checks process output before going into production with the code. “This
four-eyes approach is pivotal to ensuring an additional review level and
will increase confidence in the outputs.”</p>
<p>Dent started her career in treasury with “little to no” knowledge of
coding. It was only after receiving a ‘Visual Basic: run-time error’
message when working on a crucial Excel spreadsheet, that her journey
into coding began.</p>
<p>“I was challenged by my boss at the time (who understood coding) to
find the solution to the issue for myself,” she explains. “And it was
from here that I started to learn exactly how to use macros, automate
and create time-saving efficiencies in many different situations.” She
comments that coding is about problem solving and logical thinking.
“These two skills that any treasury person should excel at, so we should
have a head start in learning to code.”</p>
<p>Automation often brings fear for job security. Dent has a positive
take on the application of technology. Instead of ignoring the
efficiencies it can create for fear that jobs may become redundant, she
says it is important that treasurers focus on automation as an enabler,
fully reaping the benefits which arguably make the role more secure.</p>
<p>Indeed, Dent believes coding is just as important today as the more
traditional treasury skills. “It allows individuals to challenge the
norm and become a more valuable asset to the organisation,” she
comments, adding that it will become even more important over time “as
treasuries shrink and people are required to do more with less”.</p></img>

<h3 id=""finding-the-cash"">Finding the cash</h3>
<p>A treasurer for a small or mid-sized company, without a TMS or access
to other appropriate technologies, is most probably struggling to
deliver, or at best delivering in spite of a lack of senior level
support, comments di Paola. With most of the time spent just keeping the
lights on, finding the time to build and present a business case is
appreciably difficult.</p>
<p>It is true also that the bulk of the treasurer’s case for investment
will be qualitative not quantitative; this is rarely a good indicator
when most business leaders run on hard numbers.</p>
<p>If the task seems insurmountable, it is perhaps the reason why so
many treasurers soldier on with spreadsheets and manual processes. But
solid hard-number based arguments can be found. Even in a mid-sized
international company, there is a question about just how ‘domestic’ the
banking arrangements often are. These relationships have often grown up
locally, sometimes as a result of M&amp;A, without too much control
from the centre.</p>
<p>Local bank accounts may be harbouring pools of cash that whilst not
necessarily idle, would provide more value if swept centrally or
regionally. Bank account structuring too could be made more efficient,
using fewer banks and economies of scale to present fee-saving
opportunities. If suitably re-engineered, both these quantifiable
situations can be used to effectively finance the qualitative and
systems side of treasury transformation.</p>
<p>With the right technology, certain activities become possible.
Enabling daily visibility of cash, for example, can allow it to be
worked harder, even in a low interest rate environment where returns are
minimal. Using cash to pay down more debt has a clearly quantifiable
benefit.</p>
<p>An additional quantifiable benefit comes on the FX side, where being
able to hedge centrally and net positions will reduce spreads. “Even
manual treasuries today will be using some form of electronic dealing
platform – and if they are not, then they should be,” comments di Paola.</p>
<p>Treasurers should also be examining processes, perhaps by
benchmarking, to see where savings can be made on FTEs. For instance,
process automation can help re-focus the labour deployed on manually
allocating cash or entering accounting data, to more value-adding tasks.
In fact, in a world of increased risk, the insight and judgment of the
professional treasurer will always be needed, says Taylor: “no algorithm
could match that”.</p>

<p class=""management-summary"">With strong organic and M&amp;A growth,
diversified technology giant, Alibaba Group, has been rapidly expanding
into additional channels and territories in recent years. This had
naturally been increasing complexity across its treasury infrastructure,
creating a diverse portfolio of banks in different geographic regions,
and cash assets in multiple currencies.</p>
<p>The net result has been that more treasury time and focus was
required to meet the needs of the business. But with a management
mandate to keep headcount lean, operating in an ever more complex
environment meant new technology was the only answer.</p>
<p>The unique demands of this vast tech-focused organisation led
Alibaba’s treasury team to conclude that standard systems and
off-the-shelf TMSs were not suitable. Instead, it opted to use in-house
talent to create an integrated web-based ‘treasury management
intelligence’ (TMI) platform.</p>
<p>Driven by a unique insight into the needs of the whole business,
Alibaba Group’s platform delivers all the functionality it needs. This
covers areas such as multi-banking, automation, real-time analytics and,
in the form of a dashboard, management decision-making support.</p>
<p>Having built the single platform in-house also gives treasury access
to a strong onsite technical support team that is well-equipped for the
‘agile’ development so necessary in the dynamic technological and
commercial environment in which Alibaba Group operates.</p>
<p>“Users in different job levels can easily find or drill down into the
relevant information for management decision-making or operational
execution purposes,” says Randy Ou, the firm’s Treasury VP. He explains
that the system has enhanced productivity and relieved resource
constraints to the extent that treasury now has more than 95% cash
visibility, and has reduced idle cash by 30%, across a vastly more
complex yet leaner organisation.</p>
<p>With recognition for the Alibaba Group, as Overall Winner of the 2016
Adam Smith Awards Asia ‘Harnessing the Power of Technology’ category,
treasury has demonstrated the value of the ‘build not buy’ approach.</p>

<h3 id=""telling-a-balanced-story"">Telling a balanced story</h3>
<p>The use of professionally produced industry benchmarks (considering
the relationship between revenue and treasury headcount, for example),
can help treasurers tell their story. Whilst sector studies of this
nature need to be contextualised, by referencing such data, it can still
give treasurers a real directional sense of how good a process can be.</p>
<p>Of course, it is incumbent upon treasurers to use such tools to help
make the business case for investment. But it is vital for them to
understand how the culture of their own organisation will influence what
goes into their story.</p>
<p>Doing so will help decide to what degree the qualitative arguments –
such as the risk of error or loss due to manual processing or the lack
of visibility of cash or FX exposure across the business – will resonate
with the CFO. From here it will be easier to calculate how much
emphasis should be placed on quantifiable data such as funding costs,
bank fees, spreads on FX, and FTE savings.</p>
<h3 id=""raising-the-profile"">Raising the profile</h3>
<p>The pressure is on for treasurers to be more efficient, particularly
in smaller companies. But we know that doing more with less may remove
levels of segregation, bringing about more operational risk.</p>
<p>The big picture needs to be understood and communicated to those
applying the pressure. To do this, treasurers need to develop a strong
and compelling voice. “The internal marketing of treasury, fully
explaining its value, is key,” advises di Paola. “If nobody understands
that, with the best will in the world, it is not going to be able to
make any of the necessary investments.”</p>
<p>One way of raising the profile that has proven (at least anecdotally)
to be effective is by delivering a regular report to the CFO and other
senior stakeholders. By quantifying its own value and demonstrating what
the company would lose without it, treasury brings its own value into
sharp relief for the rest of the business. From here, the case for
progress becomes that little bit easier.</p>
<p>If ‘more with less’ is part of your remit, industry conferences,
forums, banking partners, consultants, and of course trade publications
such as Treasury Today, have the power to connect professionals globally
and help share ideas.</p>

ION Treasury</h5>

<br/>
<p> </p>
<p>Corporate treasury is a very different job compared to what it was a decade ago. The complexity of the role has increased markedly due to globalisation, cyber risk and rapid organic and inorganic global business growth. At the same time, there has been a significant shift in the importance of the role treasury plays within the organisation, with the department becoming ever more strategic in its outlook.</p>
<p>Whilst this is certainly a positive development for the profession, it has also created some challenges for treasury teams. Most notably they are expected to do a lot more with the same resources they had a decade ago – and in some cases less.</p>
<p>Technology has been used to solve this conundrum to some degree. However, a less-than-strategic approach to technology investment and maintenance over the years has left many organisations with a variety of disparate legacy systems. These are often complex, costly, poorly maintained and, worst of all, usually siloed. As a result, treasury teams are trying to do a complex job with only half the truth and little trust in the data with which they are working. Added to this is the multitude of operational risks that this fragmented infrastructure creates.</p>
<p>A solution to this challenge can be found in implementing an enterprise-grade treasury and risk management system (TRMS). Doing so can not only improve treasury performance, it can also greatly improve overall corporate performance. For instance, at a strategic level, using a TRMS can break down the technological and operational silos, not just enabling a faster flow of data but also allowing enterprise-wide access to a single source of truth.</p>
<p>From a tactical perspective, a TRMS can improve cash visibility. At the very least, this enables treasurers to deploy previously tied-up cash more effectively. The system can also be used to automate many manual and repetitive processes, creating optimal workflows. This alone frees up time for the team to focus on more strategic matters. Crucially, better controls further serve to more successfully mitigate the risk of fraud.</p>
<p>As part of any good business case, there are clear financial advantages to be considered too. Increased efficiency through automation offers the potential to reduce or redeploy headcount (the latter often to more value-added tasks). Having a single system also lowers overall IT spend – if the solution is hosted in the cloud then the vendor assumes responsibility for maintenance and updates (the user always benefitting from the latest iteration). The relative cost of a TRMS has fallen significantly in recent years, even as it has become notably more configurable to the needs of treasury departments of all shapes and sizes.</p>
<p>Treasury still needs to sell the TRMS to the purse-holders in the company. Despite the increasingly obvious benefits, this remains a challenge for many teams. To be able to make its case effectively, treasury needs to consider two key elements: the strategic rationale and the return on investment (ROI). This process demands an acute understanding of the businesses objectives and the capacity to link the benefits of the TRMS directly to these. In essence, treasury must be able to answer the simple yet inevitable question: where is the value from investing in treasury technology?</p>
<p>To help treasury teams answer this question with utmost conviction, Ion Treasury, Openlink and the Strategic Treasurer have joined forces to build an ROI calculator. This enables treasury teams to clearly and precisely demonstrate the value a system can offer the organisation. More than just showing the immediate ROI, the calculator highlights the long-term ROI that such a system can offer, reflecting the fact that a TRMS is a technology investment for the entire company, not a technology expense for one department.</p>
<p>As the business grows and the demands on treasury time and knowledge increase, the value of that investment will ultimately be self-evident. Until then, building a robust business-case should be seen as a treasury priority.</p>

<h5 id=""relx-group"">Suzanne Perry, Assistant Group Treasurer, RELX Group:</h5>
Treasury teams operate for the long-term, balancing risk and reward, and thus are ideally placed to define the company’s optimal capital structure. It is vital that the capital structure is tailored to a company’s profile and specific objectives and is resilient enough to operate both in current market conditions and under stress. Having said this, resilience cannot come at any cost and treasury needs to ensure that the company is run efficiently with a mix of short and long-term debt as well as more expensive equity financing.
<p>At RELX Group the capital structure is managed to support our objective of maximising long-term shareholder value through appropriate security of funding, ready access to debt and capital markets, cost-effective borrowing and flexibility to fund business and acquisition opportunities while maintaining appropriate leverage to ensure an efficient capital structure. RELX Group has a diversified and relatively low risk business model and seeks to maintain credit rating agency metrics that are consistent with a solid investment grade credit rating (RELX Group’s current ratings are BBB+/Baa1/BBB+ with S&amp;P, Moody’s and Fitch respectively). RELX Group targets cash flow conversion of over 90% and over the longer-term this cash is used with an eye to balancing dividend policy, selective acquisitions and share repurchases, and retaining balance sheet strength so as to maintain access to cost-effective sources of borrowing.</p>
<p>RELX Group customers appreciate the low level of financial risk associated with the company. RELX Group is a global provider of information and analytics for professional and business customers across industries. Customers include governments, universities and other institutions seeking long-term strategic partnerships. A solid investment grade credit rating is consistent with the message that RELX Group is a company that will be around for the duration.</p>
<p>In recent years RELX Group has spent less on acquisitions and focussed on organic growth. In order to maintain an efficient capital structure and prevent an increase in WACC, RELX Group has undertaken share buy-back programmes to maintain leverage in a range consistent with a BBB+/Baa1 rating. Treasury maintains RELX Group’s cash flow forecasts and related leverage metrics and hence can advise the board as to how share buy backs fit into the company’s overall credit rating profile. RELX Group operates several commercial paper programmes to ensure short-term liquidity and to avoid inefficient balance sheet grossing as the significant amounts of cash collected in the final quarter of each calendar year can be used to pay down commercial paper rather than sit as cash on the balance sheet at year end.</p>
<p>RELX Group Treasury continues to monitor the requirements of the rating agencies, the liquidity and cost of debt capital markets and takes instruction from the board on risk appetite. Any significant change in any of these elements would necessitate a review of the capital structure to ensure it is still fit for purpose.</p>

Treasurers today are operating in a very dynamic environment, where ongoing challenges and complexities make it difficult to predict the future and streamline their organisations. External influences from macro-economic impacts to innovative trends in new technology and new competitors, mean treasurers need to equip their organisations to be agile and responsive to seize opportunities but also stay resilient and efficient in the face of change and potential shocks.
<p>This balance requires careful, detailed and regular review of the capital requirements and financial policies.</p>
<p>Determining the likely funding needs based on business outlook will be the main driver of this review and is clearly a complex task. This analysis should include detailed, informed assumptions around revenues, changes in working capital, acquisitions and disposals, dividend policy, cost of debt, and new debt issuance, amongst others. Through understanding of key aspects of the business, like liquidity, projected return on investment in R&amp;D and geographical or product expansion, and the potential impact of the economic, societal and regulatory environment in which it operates, a treasurer can ascertain critical future needs.</p>
<p>For instance, liquidity headroom for a corporate looking to increase its R&amp;D investment over the next few years will be very different to those of a mature corporate looking to maintain strong shareholder returns.</p>
<p>The next step is around making your balance sheet shock proof and getting the right mix of debt and equity. Treasurers need to dissect various components of the capital structure and reassess whether the corporate’s financial policies are still fit for purpose. Is the current rating (or financial leverage) appropriate for the business and its outlook? Are the committed facilities enough to cover upcoming requirements or are they unnecessarily high?</p>
<p>One aspect that normally gets ignored in this analysis is country risk, which is an important consideration for global corporates given exposure to any volatile geographies.</p>
<p>Combining this information with the original understanding of the business profile will help outline a truly optimal capital structure. In many cases, this exercise may highlight actionable insights on how to achieve this; such as aligning with medium and long-term targets and considering appropriate liquidity buffers, whilst also incorporating issues that are specific to the business, such as forthcoming acquisitions.</p>
<p>Finally, it never hurts to do a competitor analysis. Many corporates like to benchmark against their direct competitors but, in some cases, it is useful to compare more broadly. Best practice for one organisation may not be appropriate for another. So, it’s important to consider the variables of each organisation in terms of capital structure, end market exposure and shareholder objectives.</p>
<p>The results of any exercise to evaluate capital structure should be regularly reviewed. Treasurers should also incorporate stress testing and scenario planning in the process, as this exercise can help identify, and sometimes even quantify, black swan events.</p>
<p>With access to the right data, analytics and knowledge, treasurers can formulate a capital structure that will help deliver the business’ strategy, increase resilience in the face of unknown challenges and equip the business to position itself for the opportunities ahead.</p>

Whilst an optimal capital structure is synonymous with Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) theory; in practice, treasury functions focus very much on the debt side of the equation. As a result, it is useful to consider treasury’s role and some of the practical steps it can undertake to optimise debt levels.
</figure>
<p>Corporates tend to seek a level of debt which is commensurate with their scale, industry sector and risk appetite. This should also reflect a desire to retain a debt buffer to cater for unexpected events such as M&amp;A activity, cyclical results or a downturn in trading.</p>
<p>Since banks and rating agencies have similar methodologies in assessing corporate risk whether a corporate is rated or not, treasury functions may wish to consider focussing on the following three risk elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Business risk – analysis of the stability and predictability of a business (country and industry risk as well as competitive position within industry).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Financial risk – assessment of the capacity of a company to meet its financial obligations (cash flow and leverage).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operational risk – being the specific strategic objectives and policies a company adopts. This includes factors such as approach to risk management, corporate actions, target debt levels and dividend policy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Whilst business risk can often only be influenced over the medium to long-term, a company has a far greater ability to directly manage its financial and operating risk.</p>
<p>Treasury plays a significant role in managing a company’s financial risk by diversifying sources of debt, repaying or extending debt maturities, holding appropriate levels of committed backup liquidity, and efficiently managing working capital. Similarly, in relation to operational risk, treasury will advise on an appropriate risk management approach and dividend policy, which is documented within the company’s treasury policies.</p>
<p>Some further practical points that treasury may consider include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Establishing a supportive banking group who will provide credit through the business cycle. This takes active management by considering the core banks strengths and weaknesses, total level of ancillary fees and how these are allocated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provision of company data including forecasts. It is important that these forecasts are credible over time – so treasury may have to apply haircuts to over optimistic corporate finance forecasts. Banks and rating agencies have long memories and consistently demonstrating an ability to meet forecasts will enhance a relationship of trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regular meetings with banks and rating agencies. This allows the CFO/Group Treasurer/Investor Relations the opportunity to provide context and explanations to financial results and forecasts. Rating agencies should be invited to any debt or equity analysts’ presentations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A formal annual review of treasury policies, signed off by the board. In doing so the company’s risk management approach is front of mind to the board. Regular reporting of adherence further supports this activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitoring credit metrics and estimating debt capacity, by working alongside corporate finance. Treasury can add value into any M&amp;A funding decisions and use the output to further develop banking group relationships.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The aforementioned points demonstrate the multi-faceted nature of bank relationships and ratings agencies. Financial ratios are one facet, but equally perception and communication are critical. Where permitted, sharing confidential forecasts and board objectives on financial and operating risk appetite will further these relationships. Treasury resource is required to support this high level financial discipline as a loss of confidence takes a long time to repair.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Finance is certainly no stranger to technology, with banks first adopting digital solutions like credit cards and ATM machines in the 1950s and 1960s. Since then, finance has adopted more and more technology as banks further digitised internally and bought new solutions to their clients. However, over the past decade, the shortcomings of the financial system have been laid bare, especially when it comes to technology, where it has lagged behind other industries.</p>
<p>Banks have realised this and over the past few years there has been a clear transformation happening in finance around the world. This has been spurred on by a wave of exciting fintech companies that have brought fresh ideas to the table and begun redefining the role of financial services providers. Although a lot of this activity is happening in the retail space, there is also a lot going on in the commercial banking world, work that is having a big impact on corporate treasury professionals who are gradually gaining access to a variety of new and exciting technologies that enable them to become more valuable within the company, and a true strategic partner.</p>
<h3 id=""the-great-drivers-of-change"">The great drivers of change</h3>
<p>To find out how financial technology has evolved in recent years, the current landscape, new trends and the direction that leading experts think technology will be taking the corporate treasury profession, Treasury Today spoke with some of the top names in the industry. First up was Dr Andrei Kirilenko, Director of the Centre for Global Finance and Technology at the Imperial College Business School. His work focuses on the intersection of finance, technology and regulation and he is an intellectual leader on the principles of regulation of automated financial markets.</p>
<p><strong>Treasury Today:</strong> What makes technology the most important trend in finance today?</p>
<p><strong>Dr Andrei Kirilenko:</strong> Technology companies that decide to enter finance on a very large scale can reimagine financial services. There are certainly examples in China where finance is provided on top of a web search engine or a provider of SMS messaging.</p>
<p>This is very different because imagine a technology company that provides you with the ability to search the web, the ability to select other services that you use, knows where you are, knows who you are talking to, and therefore can position financial services including treasury services in ways that traditional providers of financial services may not even think about.</p>
<p>Another reason that technology is so important is that it can give businesses new insights into their customers. For example, there is a company that knows when somebody has broken the screen of their mobile phone. It has data on when screens are most likely to be broken and by what demographic. This is information that you don’t particularly collect as a bank or an insurance company but it appears with a predictable pattern for providers of technology services that could be used to position something in front of a particular individual, for example, an insurance product to insure your screen from physical damage.</p>
<p>So, if you have predictability in your data and position your product in front of potential customers just at a time when something like that is about to happen, the probability of them using this service skyrockets.</p>
<p><strong>Treasury Today:</strong> What areas of finance face the biggest impact from fintech?</p>
<p><strong>Dr Andrei Kirilenko:</strong> There are surveys that have asked companies what part of their operation is most likely to be impacted – front office, middle office or back office – and the fact is that it will be all of these.</p>
<p>Driving this is the growth in cloud computing, which makes the introduction of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques possible on a large scale in a cost-effective way. The job for corporate treasury teams will be figuring out how and where they want to deploy these technologies.</p>
<p>I think the bigger challenge, however, is integrating these technologies into their existing operations because as corporate treasurers they are under very strict obligations to follow certain processes and procedures. I am aware of some situations where a parallel system has literally been built alongside an existing system that is human-centric, so I would say that those corporate treasurers who want to stay relevant, want to participate in building and fine-tuning and deployment of these digital systems, because at the end of the day they will probably be the ones replacing some of the aspects.</p>
<h3 id=""taking-treasury-to-the-next-level"">Taking treasury to the next level</h3>
<p>Also of interest is how technology has changed the way that corporate treasurers operate and the impact they expect it to have going forward. To find out a little bit more about this we interviewed Zac Nesper, Vice President and Assistant Treasurer at HP Inc who states that “technology is central to everything we do as a treasury department”.</p>
<p><strong>Treasury Today:</strong> What technologies do you use within your treasury department and what value is this bringing?</p>
<p><strong>Zac Nesper:</strong> We use technology in several areas. These include multi-dimensional databases such as our treasury management system and even some new technology like robotics for cash visibility and reporting as well as trend prediction of algorithms and analytics.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I think that technology is increasing access to information. It is also reducing barriers to entry in the financial system and democratises finance when you think about the accessibility of information across a broad swathe of the population.</p>
<p>From a treasury perspective, technology is lowering costs and providing increased accessibility via mobile devices. There is also the potential to utilise technologies that offer predictive analytics. Because of all this, there are things I can do with a bank that were just not possible ten years ago. For example, I have not been into a branch to make a deposit, I check my balances daily on my phone and when you look at countries in Africa they are skipping an entire generation of technology and really banking via mobility, which is enabling economic development. So it is absolutely changing the landscape for the better.’</p>
<p><strong>Treasury Today:</strong> What emerging technology is of the most interest?</p>
<p><strong>Zac Nesper:</strong> Blockchain I think may prove revolutionary but it is nascent and I think at times it can be even a little over hyped. We are also using robotics actively. But personally, I think the technology that will have the most impact is machine learning.</p>
<p>If you think about applying this technology to your cash management process it can learn some of the behaviours around how you optimise, how you move funds to make sure that bills get paid, how you reduce credit counterparty risk and how you maximise investment income. In doing so, the technology can take on some of these tasks and provide data to the treasury employees who are executing it and essentially to make them more productive, more insightful and more analytic.</p>
<p>Technologies like this get me incredibly excited about the future of the treasury profession.</p>
<p><strong>Treasury Today:</strong> Given the influence of technology on corporate treasury, what do you think the treasury profession will look like in five to ten years?</p>
<p><strong>Zac Nesper:</strong> Treasury is all about the allocation and optimisation of the company’s capital resources. And I think just as multi-dimensional databases and early analytics enabled whole new areas of capital optimisation, I think that treasury technology in the future will really take this to the next level.</p>
<p>This holds both promise and risk for treasury professionals. I think the professional of the future is going to need to be well versed in how to use technology to maximise her or his impact. Those that cannot adapt will be left behind by automation and I think tech-savvy peers will have enormous system enabled productivity. And so when I think about the next generation of treasury leaders or treasurers, they’re going to add IT expertise to their knowledge of finance and economics and really be able to use those technologies to maximise value.</p>
<p>I think it is an incredibly exciting time to be a treasury professional because what we all want to do is analytics versus data collection, we want to impact business decisions and I think technology is going to enable that in the next ten years.</p>
<h3 id=""increased-connectivity-efficiency-and-transparency"">Increased connectivity, efficiency and transparency</h3>
<p>Our final expert voice is Michael Spiegel, Head of Cash Management and the Regional Head of Global Transaction Banking, Germany at Deutsche Bank, one of the world’s biggest banks by assets. He says that in his 30-plus years working in transaction banking he has “never seen a period of change quite like the change we are seeing today”. Most exciting for him is how all of this development is “ushering in a new era of connectivity, efficiency and transparency for corporates”.</p>
<p><strong>Treasury Today:</strong> Can all treasury teams benefit equally from technology and what do they need to do to begin taking advantage of these new solutions?</p>
<p><strong>Michael Spiegel:</strong> Innovation is not necessarily driven only by the large technology companies; this environment of disruptive change is also an opportunity for corporates of all sizes and types as well as banks themselves to rethink existing business models and prepare for a change in client demand.</p>
<p>I think a lot of it comes down to culture and making time to prepare for the future. At Deutsche Bank, we foster a culture that encourages the idea of faster, leaner and smarter, but also need to accept that innovation requires fading fast to learn fast. We have become much better at involving our clients at an early stage of exploration and validation of market problems to co-create relevant and problem-oriented solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Treasury Today:</strong> How is Deutsche Bank working with fintech companies?</p>
<p><strong>Michael Spiegel:</strong> We are working very cooperatively with many fintechs – historically we have been a provider of payment services to this sector and increasingly we are collaborating with several players to create new products and services that take more friction out of the system and are value adds to our clients. Importantly, many of our clients are also part of such developments, they are evolving their business models as well.</p>
<p><strong>Treasury Today:</strong> Are there any downsides to the increased use of technology in corporate treasury departments?</p>
<p><strong>Michael Spiegel:</strong> Yes, Cybercrime is top of the agenda for many corporates. As soon as you establish linkages to suppliers, business partners or technology vendors, the security of their systems as well as their risk management protocols becomes of relevance also to you as a corporate. When you have a large-scale supply chain, every step in that chain has both technological as well as human capital risks.</p>
<p><strong>Treasury Today:</strong> How will regulations such as PSD2 impact the financial services landscape over the coming years and what will this mean for corporate treasurers?</p>
<p><strong>Michael Spiegel:</strong> The direction of travel of global regulation and compliance is around greater transparency and competition. Use of open APIs is only going to increase in the years ahead, which will potentially provide new revenue streams but will also require banks and companies to have the appropriate skills as well as security protocols in place. We all need to be well aware of whom we are opening an API door to and why. PSD2 will give rise to new potential cybercrime considerations also since third-party access will be the order of the day.</p>
<h3 id=""ready-for-the-future"">Ready for the future?</h3>
<p>What really shines through from all these conversations is the sheer degree of change that technology is having on finance and corporate treasury. Indeed, it will be extremely interesting to watch how this space develops further as technologies such as blockchain, AI, robotics and the like mature. And when this is tied in with regulatory developments such as PSD2 and Open Banking in Europe I think it is safe to say that an awful lot more change is to come.</p>

<br/>
<p> </p>
<p>The speed with which new technology services and solutions are being developed is increasing dramatically. One explanation frequently cited as a driver for the rise in new technologies is Moore’s Law which, in its simplified form, states that overall processing power for computers doubles every two years.</p>
<p>This exponential growth in processing power is changing the world around us. Today, smartphones, 3D printing, universal translation, drones, robotics, self-driving cars and the internet of things are a reality; just a decade ago they were science fiction.</p>
<p>Within financial services and corporate treasury the same is true. The industry is abuzz with talk about the transformational impact of technologies such as Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), as well as market reforms such as Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) and Open Banking. The most exciting thing for treasury teams is that there is no need to wait to begin benefiting from these technologies: many are already available today.</p>
<p>The question then is: “How can these technologies be applied to positively impact my treasury operation?”</p>
<h2 id=""digital-cash-management"">Digital cash management</h2>
<h4 id=""accounts-payables"">Accounts payables</h4>
<p>Depending on where and how technology is applied there is ample opportunity for treasury teams to significantly improve existing processes – even when that process already has a high degree of automation. Take accounts payable (AP), for example. Whilst many of Citi’s clients are already benefiting from impressive levels of automation and straight through processing (STP), the sheer volume of payments, along with the fact that many of the payments are generated by teams outside of central treasury, mean it is difficult for treasury to identify payments that fall outside the usual payment behaviour.</p>
<p>New technology can help address this issue. For example, at Citi, investments in sophisticated machine learning and AI technology have led to the development of our Payment Outlier Detection Service which is now in active pilot. This advanced data analytics tool assesses all transactions that flow through our system against a client-specific behaviour profile. It then triggers real-time alerts for transactions that do not conform to the routine patterns and behaviours of the specific organisation. It also constantly updates the client-specific profile to better detect future erroneous payment.</p>
<p>Similar technology is also being applied to enhance security and protection on several other fronts. For instance, many banks, including Citi, are incorporating AI and pattern/behavioural recognition functionality into the security layers of their electronic banking systems. These tools can be used to check a user’s computer for known malware infections – as well as using behavioural biometrics and user pattern recognition techniques to assign risk scores to user activity and perform additional control steps for high-risk actions.</p>
<p>These developments are significant for our clients, given the substantial growth in payment volumes. The additional controls and real-time alerts help treasury teams to target payment outliers that deviate from their past characteristics.</p>
<h4 id=""multi-currency-flows"">Multi-currency flows</h4>
<p>Treasurers are also seeing a positive impact from new technology when it comes to managing multi-currency flows. Traditionally, this process has presented several challenges: i) the need to obtain competitive pricing, ii) the need for active FX execution, iii) the need for hedging and iv) the use of expansive account structures through which to manage these flows.</p>
<p>Whilst active FX execution continues to be beneficial for strategic ‘big-ticket’ items – along with associated hedging – we now see that treasury teams are becoming more comfortable leveraging technology to execute transactional FX. Where historically there may have been a relatively low threshold for automated/passive FX set out in the treasury policy (eg US$10,000 equivalent), we now see that with the use of transparent benchmarks, pre-agreed spreads and enhanced real-time reporting, clients are becoming much more comfortable and are revisiting the treasury policy, increasing the threshold (in some cases to a US$1m equivalent) in order to reduce the time and effort spent on active dealing, in favour of automation benefits.</p>
<p>Coupled with the increased automation of transactional FX flows, we also see a rising trend for rationalised account structures. These reduce the use of dedicated foreign currency accounts for marginal currencies, integrating that flow through existing core currency accounts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with the emergence of more advanced payer ID and virtual account offerings, banks are now able to provide clients with customised ‘sub-ledger’ virtual accounts that are linked to a real-world physical account. This helps to segregate and manage incoming receipts, optimise outgoing payments and simplify the journey for corporate treasury to adopt ‘in-house bank’ and ‘on-behalf-of’ structures.</p>
<h4 id=""accounts-receivables"">Accounts receivables</h4>
<p>New technology is also positively impacting another core cash management activity: accounts receivables (AR). Indeed, accurate and timely cash application remains a challenge for many corporates – especially when direct debit “pull of funds” is not possible. This is in spite of significant effort around improving invoicing practices and communication of correctly formatted payment instructions.</p>
<p>This is because when the AR process relies on the buyer to initiate a payment, there is a lack of control over the way invoices are paid. As such it is common for the amounts received to vary from the amount outstanding on the AR ledger. This can be due to discounts being applied, multiple invoices being grouped, payments being made in a different currency than the invoice/AR item, deductions to the principle by correspondent banks, or simply because the payment does not carry sufficient reference information to identify the remitter or invoice. Because of this, it is still common to find many people employed to manage the AR process – albeit they may be in a low-cost location.</p>
<p>However, in this area, we are now seeing the application of new technology that leverages matching algorithms to understand historical matching patterns and machine learning to ‘watch’ the steps taken by experienced matching clerks and ‘learn’ to apply incoming funds – even when discounts, bulking or cross-currency challenges feature in the payment practices. This new technology can yield significant savings and efficiency gains in an area that is widely considered challenging to automate.</p>
<p>Not only can this solution reduce the cost associated with a labour-intensive process, the timely reconciliation and application of cash delivers further benefits in terms of improving day sales outstanding (DSO) metrics and free cash flow. It can also positively impact sales growth as customer credit lines are updated in near real-time.</p>
<h4 id=""financial-messaging"">Financial messaging</h4>
<p>Another area undergoing rapid change is financial messaging, promoting both increased transparency and speed of information flow. For a long time, the connectivity landscape has remained relatively unchanged with three main choices of channel:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Electronic banking system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Host-to-host connection directly with the bank.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SWIFT.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the past decade – we have seen a move towards global consistency – driven largely by the adoption of ISO 20022 XML messaging. Today, we see several new developments in this space driven by investments in new technology. For example, the SWIFT global payments innovation (gpi) provides live status updates on payments through the end-to-end payment chain. Coupled with this, the opening up of bank APIs is promoting the use of real-time messaging for a wide variety of services, from the basic account balance enquiry and initiation of a payment, through to a whole host of value added services such as FX rate quotes, reporting, investments and user management. This list of services is expected to expand as new technology will connect into and overlay the traditional banking infrastructure. Furthermore, as markets go live with instant payment and collection capabilities, and banks open up a broad range of services through APIs – the journey towards real-time cash management will become possible.</p>
<h3 id=""thinking-big-and-bringing-it-all-together"">Thinking big and bringing it all together</h3>
<p>That said, despite so much new technology now being available, many treasuries are yet to take full advantage – joining together key components and new technologies to create a digital treasury ecosystem.</p>
<p>Herein then lies the major difference between the adoption of new technology in our daily lives and the challenge for large organisations. When an individual decides that the time is right to upgrade to a new technology, the transition is usually very straightforward – as it is a straight swap, old for new.</p>
<p>For the treasurer, the adoption of new technology presents several complications. Most notable is the sheer number of existing systems, processes and interfaces that need to be considered and tested as part of the transition, whilst ensuring that operations continue as normal at the same time.</p>
<p>This means that rather than a single swap ‘old to new’, treasury needs to make changes component by component. This will require key elements to be upgraded with re-engineering projects that run in parallel to the daily operation. By taking this approach, treasurers can take on a strategic business optimisation role to continually refine, upgrade and improve treasury performance.</p>
<h4 id=""act-now"">Act now</h4>
<p>Assessing new technologies, and whether or how best to incorporate them, will form an increasingly important part of the treasury function. When done correctly, one can see significant gains across many dimensions, including cost, control, efficiency, scalability and support for new business activities.</p>
<p>At Citi we have set up Innovation Labs around the world, which partner with clients and third parties to accelerate innovation. For our clients, this is a great way to see the end-to-end innovation lifecycle and engage in collaboration and co-creation activities.</p>
<p>Given the increasing focus that banks are placing on their technology offering, we recommend that treasurers have regular engagement with their banking partners. This will allow treasurers to explore what’s new and how innovations are becoming established best practices that can drive value for the business.</p>

How technology is helping treasurers deliver strategic advantage,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em><img alt=""Openlink"" height=""44"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/logo/openlink-logo-2017-130x44.png?la=en&amp;hash=C3B3CC98004DE0621A2B067697DC9750"" width=""130""/></em></p>
<p><em>The age of the strategic treasurer is here; the global financial crisis made sure of that. However, for corporate treasuries to achieve their full strategic potential, support from the right kind of technology is essential, especially when it comes to achieving full visibility over financial flows and the broad sweep of commercial risk. Here, Treasury Today and Openlink explore the ways in which treasurers can deliver strategic advantage to the organisation.</em></p>
<p> The essence of strategic treasury is that it is an integral part of business decision-making. This means full and timely visibility over all financial flows is critical. There is no other way of effectively mitigating risks and facilitating growth. Arguably, anything less will limit the usefulness of treasury in the eyes of the C-Suite and the board. This is especially true if it leads to lost opportunities in a fiercely competitive and volatile world.</p>
<h3 id=""a-changed-world"">A changed world</h3>
<p>A clean balance sheet has become a crucial element for companies seeking to achieve the right level of funding post-crisis. To achieve this, treasurers must align their understanding of FX and interest rate positions with those of derivatives and, through these, their exposure to raw materials and commodities trades. With boards calling upon Group Treasurers to provide the necessary clarity, the more proactive and aspirational players within the rank and file of treasury are demonstrating their business acumen by driving the agenda for change upwards.</p>
<p>Looking at this in practical terms, we can see an immediate case for change. In an (albeit simplified) manufacturing context, procurement requests cash to buy raw materials, treasury will review and provide the funding. The materials are turned into a finished product which is sold, the cash is collected and eventually returned to treasury’s control for onward dispersal.</p>
<p>The problem is that quite often these processes and their respective data streams are disjointed. For efficiency to reign, they need to be part of a natural continuum. How can this be achieved? A system that offers complete visibility across the organisation can effectively reintegrate the workflow. Suddenly, enterprise-wide visibility of cash positions, FX and commodity exposures on one system is achievable. Spurred on by this notion, the most receptive treasuries are actively banishing fragmentation and re-engineering their outlook. They are using technology as their enabler.</p>
<p>Integration, and the insight it can deliver, makes for a far more ‘on point’ treasury. This is treasury capable of engaging with company financials at an operational and strategic level. In doing so, treasury is empowered to provide far more value and insight to the whole organisation than ever before.</p>
<h3 id=""sharpening-hedging-strategies"">Sharpening hedging strategies</h3>
<p>When seeking cost savings, the traditional procurement process has often relied on pure negotiation skills on spot commodity deals. Today, spot deals are commonly eschewed for longer-term contracts. But these necessitate a higher degree of cash exposure than for spots. In such a volatile global market place, being able to confidently lock-in forecasts for extended periods demands that purchases are made with far greater market acuity.</p>
<p>Treasury must be involved in managing that exposure. Why? Because it will be treasury guaranteeing the availability of any shortfall if the company is locked into a high price and the price falls significantly, just as it will be if the reverse happens and huge ‘savings’ disrupt the forecasting mode.</p>
<p>The same is true when hedging currency exposures. In stressed market conditions, increased collateral calls can put pressure on corporate cash flows. Treasury must know how to manage the cash flow around procurement processes and what the hedging costs will be.</p>
<p>Attaining such a detailed understanding is only achievable when the data is held in one system. Treasury can then rapidly respond to any market event in near-real time. This is all about transforming what once were complex decisions into relatively simple choices.</p>

<h3 id=""etihad-airways-no-more-fragmentation"">Etihad Airways: no more fragmentation</h3>
<p>The treasury of global airline Etihad is divided into front, middle and back office. The airline has many leasing contracts and loans to manage, as well as cash flow typical of modern major aviation business. In the past it had managed leases, fuel hedging, FX and interest rates and cash flow in individual systems.</p>
<p>In a highly competitive market, being able to make informed business decisions quickly is vital. With a fragmented system architecture, aside from the operational risk of separate manual input errors, the airline found rapid response was increasingly difficult. By bringing disparate systems and data sources together, the creation of a ‘single source of truth’ delivered treasury speed and agility at both an operational and strategic level, helping to take the business to the next level.</p>

<p>Of course, there is a world of difference between standard treasury technology that is used simply to manage cash, and the more sophisticated modern product that brings analytical power to a wider range of functionality such as FX and interest rates. Openlink’s unified treasury cash and risk management solution takes the idea of integration several steps further, without complicating the process.</p>
<p>A leading retailer has deployed Openlink’s Findur to give it a derivative trading platform. This is combined with comprehensive cash management and trade finance functionality. Within the system, it is possible for treasury to create full what-if scenario analysis. By doing so, treasury is building an intelligent and rapid response to anticipated market events, whenever and wherever they may occur.</p>

<p>Indeed, where a business has geographically dispersed subsidiaries, the capacity of a single system to deliver full visibility, as and when required, across the enterprise is a powerful addition. For a purely operational perspective, it enables teams around the world to work more agilely from one system that provides a single source of truth. This negates the need for continuous meetings to be had across time zones and means that teams do not have to wait for reports to be manually sent over before making decisions, allowing them to work in near real-time.</p>
<p>Hosting this system on the cloud also provides accessibility for all users, removing the high financial and resource costs associated with the implementation and ongoing maintenance of in-house systems.</p>
<h3 id=""adding-value"">Adding value</h3>
<p>The effective use of technology can transform treasury from a cost-centre to a profit centre. For example, for any business collecting large volumes of cash on a daily basis, it will not typically see that cash in its bank for weeks. For the duration, this is effectively dead cash. However, if that business has full visibility of its cash position any time it chooses, it can begin to exploit overnight money market investments. When treasury is potentially making a return, to all intents and purposes, it is also adding a revenue boost.</p>

<h3 id=""cost-savings"">Cost savings</h3>
<p>With access to real-time cash positions as part of its everyday business, the treasury of one of the world’s largest shipping firms has been able to establish an in-house bank to which all subsidiaries are connected. Instead of those subsidiaries settling invoices from shipping terminals around the world in a multitude of local currencies, the in-house bank settles centrally. This saves a huge amount in bank fees alone.</p>

<p>Moreover, immediate access to a single enterprise-wide view of all actual treasury positions and up-to-the-minute forecast data is a quick route to the efficient use of credit lines and limits with banks. A treasurer armed with wide-ranging accurate and timely data knows precisely how much funding is needed, when, for how long and in which currency.</p>
<p>In a segregated architecture, it can be difficult to know when limits are being approached at group level. In affording a real-time view of current and projected limits, the single system helps to maximise use of credit lines, flagging up limit concerns, enabling treasury to spread the debt more appropriately.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with risk analytics embedded in Openlink, treasurers open to more sophisticated modelling can begin to understand bank fees around more complex structured products. Running credit value analytics, for example, can enable treasury to challenge its banks on the spreads it is being charged. With every calculation and process being audited in-system, when sending out Requests for Quote, it becomes easier to track and trace fee structures over time, assisting with any pricing discussions.</p>
<h3 id=""champion-of-champions"">Champion of champions</h3>
<p>As businesses become more complex in a competitive and volatile world, a comprehensive treasury cash and risk management solution adds value. It can provide treasurers with the visibility and understanding needed to move to the next level. This will see the role treasury plays in the business transform, becoming more proactive as a value-added advisor to the board.</p>
<p>Forward-thinking regional or deputy treasurers can sow the seeds of change. However, high-level support from individuals with strong vision and direction are needed to bring about significant transformations in any business. Where the will is shown from the top down to ring the changes, it becomes entirely possible to break down those siloes. Once this has been achieved, treasury can truly step up as the key strategic business partner.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The treasury profession is going through a period of significant change,” says Jan Dirk van Beusekom, Head of Strategic Marketing, Cash Management at BNP Paribas. “Treasurers today are less operationally focused and more strategically attuned.”
</p>
<p>Concurrently, the world around corporate treasury is changing. Technological evolution, regulatory change and geopolitical instability drive these changes – all of which is making the world more complex. It is therefore no surprise that treasurers are sometimes a little overwhelmed by all the changes they have to manage.</p>
<p>It is in response to this that BNP Paribas, together with SAP, PwC, and the European Association of Corporate Treasurers, have developed their Journeys to Treasury (JTT) initiative, which was first launched in 2016. Designed to act as a roadmap for the profession, JTT takes a deep dive into the areas that really matter for corporate treasury professionals, providing unique insights and guidance into three key themes: data analytics, cyber-security and regulatory change.</p>
<h3 id=""building-insights-from-data"">Building insights from data</h3>
<p>A key question posed by JTT is whether big data should be a focus for corporate treasurers. “The answer is, of course, yes,” says van Beusekom. “However, what is clear is that many treasurers are unsure of how to turn the bits and bytes that sit within their systems into actionable insights. As a result, a lot of their time is spent theorising about the potential of big data, rather than moving ahead with big data focused projects.”</p>
<p>Where big data is concerned, JTT suggests that an antidote to this barrier is for treasurers to stop focusing on the theoretical matters of the topic. Instead, the report suggests that treasurers can begin thinking about the areas that could be improved through greater insights delivered through data. “Cash flow forecasting, for example, is an obvious area for many treasury teams that could be enhanced through better data analysis,” says van Beusekom. “It therefore makes sense for treasury teams to begin highlighting the data sources required to achieve better cash flow forecasting.”</p>
<p>Once treasury has identified the data sources required to drive improvement, the next step is to obtain the tools required to crunch the numbers and deliver the insights. The good news for treasury teams, notes the report, is that the cost of much of this technology has come down dramatically and in some cases, can be obtained for free, making it more accessible to corporations of all shapes and sizes.</p>
<p>Often overlooked is the fact that harnessing and analysing big data can do more than just provide treasury with actionable intelligence. “The effective use of data also gives treasury the chance to make its work less repetitive,” notes van Beusekom. “Indeed, by using robotic process automation – where a computer programme takes actions based on pre-defined events informed by the data that exists within the system – treasury can automate many previously manual processes. There are already examples of corporates doing this in areas such as daily liquidity investments and FX hedging. This will not only free up more time for them to look after their strategic responsibilities, it will also likely deliver better results than if the same processes were conducted by a human.”</p>


<h2 class=""h3 copy__heading"">Key point to remember:</h2>
The question is not when and how you plan to use data analytics, but rather what is stopping you from doing so already?



<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h3 id=""managing-21st-century-risks"">Managing 21<sup>st</sup> century risks</h3>
<p>Despite the immense opportunities that technology and access to data
have created for treasury departments, these developments have also
brought a host of new risks that treasurers must manage. Indeed, a major
concern is cybercrime, the scourge of the 21st century. No business can
escape this topic, and treasury is right at the heart of managing the
risks.</p>
<p>“All departments within the organisation have a role to play in
securing its financial information,” says van Beusekom. “However, given
that the treasury department is the custodian of the company’s cash, its
role in understanding and preventing cybercrime is especially
important.”</p>
<p>JTT dives into this space in some detail, noting some shocking
statistics about cybercrime — a recent PwC report, for instance, said
that 79% of companies suffered direct financial losses because of a
breach, with 20% of them reporting a loss of over EUR1m. JTT also
provides some interesting insights into the level of preparedness within
companies, perhaps worryingly noting that many security teams operate
without the advanced skill set needed to combat the growing
sophistication of attackers.</p>
<p>The most important point for van Beusekom, however, is that a company
is only as strong as its weakest link: namely its staff. “One of the
best lines of defence for any organisation is education,” he says.
“Everyone within the company needs to be aware of the threats that it
faces, how to recognise these and what to do if they believe there is an
incident. As a bank, we take this very seriously and engage with our
clients to ensure that everyone within the organisation is fully aware
of the risks.”</p>
<p>For treasury more specifically, van Beusekom highlights the
importance of building a robust incident plan that locks down the
systems to prevent damage occurring if there is a breach. “it is also
wise to put in place a disaster recovery plan, so the business can
continue to function should the worst happen,” he adds.</p>


<h2 class=""h3 copy__heading"">Key point to remember:</h2>

<h2 class=""h3 copy__heading"">Payments in focus</h2>
As part of BNP Paribas’ drive to share knowledge with the corporate
community, for the last two years the bank has also supported the World
Payments Report, produced by Capgemini.
<br/>
<p>“The World Payments Report is the industry reference point for global
non-cash transaction market data,” says van Beusekom. “Historically, it
has chiefly served the financial industry by identifying trends and
opportunities in transaction banking. However, since our involvement
began two years ago we have pivoted the report towards the corporate
community, which is thirsty for knowledge about all the changes
happening in the payment space, and what these changes mean for them.”</p>
<p>For van Beusekom, the key finding from the World Payments Report is
that corporate adoption of digital payment methods is pushing up the
growth of wholesale non-cash transactions. Yet whilst adoption is
strong, the report says that corporates are not leveraging all the
benefits of the digital transformation to provide new propositions to
their clients.</p>
<p>Despite the innovation happening across the payments space,
corporates are still being let down by certain inefficiencies. Van
Beusekom highlights a lack of standardisation of messaging and data
capture as just one example of this.</p>
<p>“The continued focus on the payment ecosystem from regulators, banks,
corporates and fintechs means that there are lots more developments to
come,” he says. “This will hopefully drive out these inefficiencies and
create a payments ecosystem that facilities business in the 21st
century.”</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h3 id=""ready-for-regulation"">Ready for regulation?</h3>
<p>Managing regulatory change is par for the course in corporate
treasury. However, in the decade that has passed since the global
financial crisis, the volume of regulatory change that treasurers have
had to manage has been immense. This continues today, and the JTT
working group has unsurprisingly found that understanding, managing and
staying ahead of regulatory change is top of mind for nearly all
treasury teams.</p>
<p>The report goes into detail about many of the current regulations
affecting treasurers, including FBAR, PSD2, BEPS and GDPR. But most
importantly, it talks about how treasury departments can build an
efficient and resilient function. “This will allow treasurers to comply
with regulation, deal with disruption, proactively address upcoming
change and take advantage of strategic opportunities,” says van
Beusekom.</p>
<p>Indeed, van Beusekom encourages the treasury community to engage with
regulators so that they can help shape regulation, either directly or
through an organisation like the EACT. He also advises that treasurers
ask their banking partners to provide regular education sessions about
existing and incoming regulation to boost knowledge within their
companies.</p>
<p>From a practical perspective, treasurers should ensure that their
governance structures support a new approach to regulatory risk. This
includes drafting plans to deal with potentially disruptive market
events, as well as implementing a robust compliance programme that
includes other stakeholders in the business. Treasurers should also
consider appointing a compliance professional to sit within the treasury
department and centralise knowledge.</p>
<p>Finally, van Beusekom says that treasury may wish to look towards
technology to help manage regulatory change. He says that it is
important to organise significant regulatory data in a sensible manner
to establish a single source of truth. With this in place, analytical
tools can then be used to help with items such as scenario planning and
feeding data to the regulators.

<p><em>In a time of great change, corporate treasury professionals in Asia Pacific need not only a bank, but a banking partner. In this article, Citi outlines how it is supporting its clients in new and imaginative ways across cash, liquidity and trade.</em></p>
<p>For two decades Asia Pacific has been the world’s growth engine and a huge focus for many multinational corporations. However, after two decades of tremendous growth, the region has entered a new phase of its development – one defined by a rapidly changing regulatory, technological and geopolitical environment.</p>
<p>While these changes are creating challenges for businesses operating in the region, they are also fashioning new opportunities for corporates to expand the reach of their businesses and tap into new revenue streams. Asia Pacific, therefore, remains a vital component of many multinational organisations’ growth strategies.</p>
<p>In tandem with this shift in the region’s landscape, the role of corporate treasury is also changing and becoming increasingly complex and multifaceted. As a result, treasurers often find themselves in uncharted territory as they strive to manage a multitude of risks, whilst also shaping strategies that can facilitate business growth.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h3 id=""real-time-banking"">Real-time banking</h3>
<p>The impact of digitisation is arguably most noticeable in the area of payments, where developments are disrupting corporate business models and changing how companies want to be serviced by their banks. Understanding and being proactive in this area is crucial if a corporate treasurer is to support the business in its next stage of growth.</p>
<p>Indeed, the escalation of cashless payment methods in the region has seen the emergence of a host of digitally native eCommerce companies. What is notable about these organisations is the pace at which they move and the scale of their ambition relative to their size. “Digitally native companies expand at an unprecedented pace and want instant market access,” says Morgan McKenney, Asia Pacific Head of Core Cash Management, Treasury and Trade Solutions at Citi. “Companies like Uber and Airbnb, for instance, are active in over 80 markets around the world, despite being less than a decade old. The challenge then for banks is to match this speed and enable a broad range of payments and collections capabilities that enable these global digital companies to operate and grow in these markets.”</p>
<p>At the same time, more traditional organisations across the full gamut of industries are also now looking to develop their own eCommerce channels in order to grow the business. “This is having a profound impact on business models,” notes McKenney. “We are seeing many organisations assessing their distribution models given the opportunity enabled by these newer technologies to sell and market directly to consumers. And just like digitally native companies, they look to us to be a strategic partner and help them utilise the plethora of collections channels that exist across the region.”</p>
<h4 id=""fast-and-furious"">Fast and furious</h4>
<p>Facilitating these trends is the emergence of faster payment systems across the region. Not only do these systems enable payments to clear and settle in near real time, they also remove a lot of friction from the process and facilitate a host of new data-driven opportunities.</p>
<p>Citi has been an active participant in the development of these systems and has spent a lot of time and investment plugging into the infrastructure. This work is now paying dividends for the bank, which has recently launched a number of solutions which use faster payment rails.</p>
<p>One such example is the launch of Request to Pay in India which leverages the country’s Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) infrastructure. “This solution enables consumers to make real-time bank debits from their account using a tokenised address such as an email,” says McKenney. “This is particularly powerful for our eCommerce clients, as individuals purchasing from their online marketplace will be able to do so from their bank account in real time without needing to use a card. In India, where card penetration is very low, this is a powerful proposition and enables our institutional clients to reach a broader range of customers.” The solution offers further benefits to corporates in India as it is a low-cost collection method.</p>
<h4 id=""from-apis"">From APIs…</h4>
<p>Powering this solution – and many others that Citi is building – are Application Programming Interfaces, also known as APIs. Citi is at the forefront when it comes to using APIs to provide new channels for its clients to access the bank.</p>
<p>“APIs enable seamless and real-time data flow,” explains McKenney. “And through our CitiConnect platform, we have launched various APIs for payment initiation, payment status and account balance inquiries. These enable us to service our clients in a much more flexible, real time and dynamic way, providing a great client experience.”</p>
<h4 id=""to-ai"">…to AI</h4>
<p>Both APIs and new payment infrastructures support the flow of more data, and thus the ability for banks to offer clients more data-driven insights. “We are already offering our clients lots of pre-sales analytics around their flows to develop bespoke solutions,” says McKenney. “But this is just scratching the surface of what is possible with all these new technologies.”</p>
<p>McKenney adds that there is real interest from the bank’s clients around how bleeding edge technology such as robotics and AI will impact their business in the future. Clients are also asking about how Citi is changing and responding to these emerging technologies. “We will continue to invest markedly in these solutions and innovate across a multitude of areas so that we can continue to develop innovative solutions for our clients leveraging these new technologies” comments McKenney.</p>

<h3 id=""liquidity-management-in-challenging-times"">Liquidity management in challenging times</h3>
<p>As treasurers look to take advantage of these developments to support growth, they have to deliver incremental financial efficiency as well as manage liquidity and funding risks to the improved standards in what Sandip Patil, Asia Pacific Global Liquidity and Investments Head, Treasury and Trade Solutions at Citi calls “times of unprecedented challenges”. Patil notes that a combination of increased market volatility and rapidly evolving regulation are creating a new landscape. “If you look at what has happened over the past two years, it is clear that this is one of the most volatile environments that we have seen for some time,” he says.</p>
<p>Such volatile markets can cause a host of issues for corporates. For one thing, cash flows become less predictable, making it extremely difficult to forecast ahead with confidence. “If treasurers have little confidence in their forecasts, it makes managing the funding mix and ensuring that liquidity is where it is needed a very difficult task,” says Patil. “This can increase the cost of doing business significantly.”</p>
<p>The barrage of extra-territorial and in-country regulations is also proving to be challenging. Basel III, for instance, despite being a regulation aimed primarily at the banking system, is having a significant knock-on effect in terms of how banks are able to support their clients. Treasurers are finding that more time and attention needs to be paid to how liquidity is managed as a result. Other than funding cost escalation, this is also calling for new paradigm of treasury and balance sheet risk management in every company.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, in-country regulations in markets such as China, Indonesia and Malaysia have become more rigorous in recent months, hampering companies’ ability to move cash out of these markets. “These are familiar issues for treasurers in the region,” says Patil. “But what is different is that these regulations are evolving quickly and are at times not as black and white. It is therefore not easy to know what you can and can’t do at any point in time.”</p>
<p>Patil believes that a bank like Citi leverages deep presence and local market expertise to advise clients to navigate complex landscapes as well as stepping up and providing value to its clients by acting as a bridge between them and the regulators. “We are constantly in dialogue with the regulators,” he explains. “We are therefore able to bring opportunities to our clients to take advantage of regulation easing or regulatory exceptions as they occur.” Patil remarks, “Our strong footprint in every industry segment helps best practice implementation beyond the advisory domain to realise benefits and deliver efficiency goals.”</p>
<h4 id=""centralise-digitise-and-compare"">Centralise, digitise and compare</h4>
<p>While Citi is helping its clients take advantage of these ad hoc opportunities, the bank is also actively involved in helping treasurers shape longer-term strategies to better manage liquidity. For Patil, this can be broken down into three key themes.</p>
<p>The first is centralisation, a topic that has been high on the treasury agenda in Asia for some time. For Patil, however, the conversation has moved on from basic treasury centralisation and is now concentrated around breaking down silos and ensuring that all central units of the business operate in a cohesive and consistent manner. “It starts with a well-structured common treasury policy that brings together people, processes and systems to ensure that the whole business is working towards a collective goal,” says Patil. “It is also about ensuring that treasurers across multiple legal entities and countries are working with a rich and consistent data set to enable more accurate funding, liquidity and FX management.”</p>
<p>To do this, though, treasurers need to be supported by sophisticated technology – something that many organisations do not currently have in place. “A big focus for many of our clients at the moment is moving up the technology curve and implementing or standardising their technology platforms,” says Patil. “Once this is completed, they are looking to integrate these internal systems into those of their counterparties in order to allow for the straight through flow of data. From here, true automation can be established and this will help drive a lot of the risk out of the business.”</p>
<p>The final area that treasurers are paying particular attention to is benchmarking. “Treasurers are very keen to understand what the best in class businesses are doing to see what can be applied to their own operations,” says Patil. “Citi has developed a sophisticated suite of tools in its innovation labs. These leverage the bank’s data on its clients, allowing treasurers to benchmark themselves against their peers in a highly visceral and dynamic way.”</p>
<p>For Citi’s clients, this is a powerful tool: it not only highlights what is possible but also shows what is not possible yet, meaning that clients can build a focused and realistic roadmap in order to improve. “This cements the idea of a partnership with our clients,” says Patil. “We have not just highlighted the path they should take but also helped them complete the journey together and deliver efficiencies through our network, products and services.”</p>

<h3 id=""evolving-trading-strategies"">Evolving trading strategies</h3>
<p>Alongside developments relating to cash and liquidity management, treasurers are also tackling challenges – and exploring new opportunities – in the area of trade. The recent slump in global trade has created a number of challenges for businesses trading across Asia Pacific, prompting many corporates to review and transform their trading strategies both up and downstream.</p>
<h4 id=""supporting-the-supply-chain"">Supporting the supply chain</h4>
<p>“The nature of trade in Asia is fundamentally changing,” says Vishal Kapoor, Asia Pacific Trade Head, Treasury and Trade Solutions at Citi. “Where once corporates sat at the heart of their supply chains dealing directly with a large number of suppliers, they are now looking to slim down their supply chains by outsourcing the production to a small number of strategic suppliers in low-cost centres like China and Vietnam.”</p>
<p>Dealing with strategic partners can significantly reduce counterparty and settlement risks, enabling corporates to forgo traditional trade instruments like letters of credit in favour of open account trading. As a result, treasurers are taking the opportunity to place a renewed focus on optimising working capital and commercial terms with suppliers.</p>
<p>“A large proportion of our clients are looking at pushing out their payment terms in an effort to improve working capital,” says Kapoor. “But they want to do this without harming their strategic partners. Our role as a bank is to step in and develop win-win solutions that enable this to happen.”</p>
<p>Many corporates are looking to leverage supply chain finance in order to do this, and Kapoor notes that this is a significant growth area for Citi. The reason for this, says Kapoor, is that Citi has invested heavily in its supply chain finance platform over recent years and is a market leader in this space. “Our platform is global and simple to use,” he says. “This gives our clients the opportunity to connect with their suppliers in a consistent manner, no matter what market they are in. The ease of use also means that suppliers will want to keep using the platform.”</p>
<p>The bank’s success in this area is also being driven by the development of diagnostic tools. These enable Citi to leverage client data and highlight opportunities to introduce solutions such as supply chain finance.</p>
<h4 id=""no-more-barriers-to-business"">No more barriers to business</h4>
<p>Corporates, while taking steps to strengthen and support their supply chains, are also looking to do more business in the region. “Sales financing can be an especially powerful tool to facilitate this,” notes Kapoor, adding that Citi is working with a number of its clients on sales financing structures designed to offer competitive financing to clients’ customers. “There are various ways we can do this,” adds Kapoor. “For example, we can enter into a risk-sharing agreement with our client or offer credit wrapped with some insurance cover. Every deal is different so we focus on developing bespoke solutions in partnership with our suppliers.”</p>
<p>This has the added benefit of exposing Citi’s Treasury and Trade Solutions business to a much broader range of stakeholders within the client’s business. “Often, we are not only working with the treasurer on these deals but also the sales team,” says Kapoor. “As we do this we continue to build up our own in-house expertise allowing us to add even more value to our clients. Again, it is really a win-win for all parties involved.”</p>
<h4 id=""driving-digital"">Driving digital</h4>
<p>Finally, digital is also a big theme for Citi in the trade space. Behind the scenes the bank is working hard to streamline its internal trade processes, leveraging a host of cutting-edge digital tools. “We are the leaders using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to digitise the paper-based trade documents that we receive to improve our processing and turnaround times, enabling us to more readily share information and add value for our clients,” says Kapoor.</p>
<p>On the front end, Kapoor states that the bank is working hand-in-hand with regulators promoting digital solutions that remove friction for its clients as they trade across the region. To provide an example, the bank has recently launched a pioneering digital solution in partnership with the regulators in India that enables the bank’s clients to streamline and drive efficiency when making imports payments in a completely paperless way. It is solutions like this, highlighting the bank’s commitment to the region and its desire to be a genuine value-adding partner to its clients, that Kapoor believes sets the bank apart from others and that this strategy will prevail as corporates continue to seek growth in an evolving region.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>The importance of treasury within the organisation has grown in recent years – but what does this mean in practice and what tools and best practices can treasurers draw upon to support their evolving role?</em></p>
<p>Today’s treasury teams juggle all the usual mandates around cash and FX management, liquidity planning, banking relationships and trade finance. Yet these tasks have grown more complex as companies venture into new jurisdictions, global markets change and demands around risk management and transparency grow. This means that treasury expertise and strategic advice, particularly around funding and exposure to risk, is increasingly valued within corporations. In what areas are treasury teams taking centre stage to drive value across organisations, and is treasury getting the support it needs in its evolving role?</p>
<h3 id=""care-for-cash"">Care for cash</h3>
<p>The evolution of the treasurer’s role has its roots in the 2008 financial crisis. The banking turmoil sparked a recognition amongst corporate boards that finance wouldn’t be as easily available, leading to a greater focus on cash management and raising finance. “Pre-financial crisis, the role of the treasurer was simpler,” said Duncan Kellaway, a partner at law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer. “Now it is more complicated.”</p>
<p>For treasurers in companies with overseas operations, the focus on cash flow and capex discipline has turned the spotlight to an area that was already one of treasury’s biggest headaches. Repatriating trapped cash, or profits stuck overseas, is a complex task that demands more tenacity, and more interaction with the wider business, than ever before. “Trapped cash has always been an issue for us but it has increased over the past three to five years because of problems in some jurisdictions around accessing dollars,” explains Carl Burman, Head of Treasury at Danish shipping and energy conglomerate Maersk.</p>
<p>Large current account deficits and a shortage of US dollars have seen governments in Maersk’s riskier markets like Egypt, Angola and Nigeria introduce FX controls, taxes and regulation to create barriers to repatriating profits. “We have business in challenging countries, particularly in Africa, and it is difficult to access the cash that we have generated in these places,” says Burman.</p>
<p>The fact that emerging markets often produce the best growth has helped raise the importance of trapped cash within companies. For Burman, making the issue felt across the company, by arguing that the relentless focus on profits in times of straitened liquidity should be equally balanced by caring for cash, has become a priority. “We have to align our key performance indicators so that people within the organisation care more about cash balances, and are not focused just on measuring earnings,” he says. “It is also about freeing up cash that already exists.”</p>
<p>His team have found that the trapped cash challenge varies from region to region, and requires much research. Burman notes, “As long as the topic of cash management is high on the agenda we can tap resources that exist across the organisation, and draw on the wider organisation for support.” He cites Maersk’s business finance divisions as especially useful partners in finding solutions. He also has the full support of the boardroom. “We have good access to management, and better access than many other parts of the company.”</p>
<h3 id=""bond-skills"">Bond skills</h3>
<p>Treasury is also evolving and adapting to a changing lending environment. Banks’ new capital requirements mean they are lending less, and for shorter periods of time. This has left businesses having to tap different sources of funding. “There has been a shift towards seeking more capital markets debt amongst UK corporates because it offers a deeper pool of investors,” says Kellaway. He notes that historically around 70% of UK corporates’ borrowings used to be from banks in the loan market, but that this has dropped off. US corporates, in comparison, have traditionally borrowed more from the debt capital markets.</p>
<p>This contrasts with Asia where banks still have an appetite to lend, observes Singapore-based Damian Glendinning, Treasurer at Chinese PC giant Lenovo. “UK and US banks are reluctant lenders and loans are often dependent on them providing other corporate services,” he says. “But Asian banks are still happy to lend as their main business.”</p>
<p>The ability to access the capital markets is certainly driving treasury behaviour at Maersk. The company, which is in the process of separating its energy and transport businesses, issued a dual-tranche EUR bond and a three-tranche NOK bond in 2016, following on from two multi tranche issues in 2015. “We can’t rely on bank funding to the same extent because banks are being regulated differently,” says Burman. “We are a capital-heavy company so this means we are becoming more dependent on debt market financing. It requires knowledge and highly skilled professionals.”</p>
<p>A key requirement of Burman’s 15-strong team based out of Copenhagen, part of a wider treasury and risk department of 60, is managing financial risk to maintain the company’s credit rating. Although the rating goes across currencies and isn’t specific to US dollar debt, an investment grade rating is crucial to the company’s ability to access the US dollar debt market where Maersk does the bulk of its borrowing. “You need people who understand financial risk. It is related to our US dollar credit rating from S&amp;P and Moody’s which gives us access to the debt capital markets in dollars. The importance of this is changing the way we work,” he says.</p>
<p>Issuing bonds also requires proactive interaction with the capital markets. Successful issues call for imagination, and an ability for treasury to plan and forecast in advance. The focus could be on raising money for longer periods of time, or raising new debt while continuing to have existing debt in place. “In the current market it is more than just knowing that debt is due to mature, and issuing more,” explains Martin Hutchings, also a partner in Freshfields’ banking team. “Treasurers often will not want all debt to mature at the same time, as that presents refinancing risk. They will try to spread maturities to ensure that their company is not looking for a lump sum in one go.”</p>
<p>Treasury also needs to be opportunistic and ready to take advantage of market conditions. “Issuing debt could be a liability management exercise, where a company will buy back debt and replace it with cheaper borrowing because the existing debt has a higher interest,” says Hutchings.</p>
<p>Treasury’s involvement in marketing bond issues can also be intense. If it is an established name, and the company frequently issues debt, treasury’s input is small. But smaller organisations have to do extensive road shows that will involve large amounts of treasury time and expertise.</p>
<p>As companies increasingly tap the debt market, so treasury needs to forge strong relationships that allow visibility across the company. This means ensuring the company isn’t doing anything that could jeopardise its credit rating or that could breach any of its existing covenants, in particular its financial ratios. “If a company is negotiating a loan agreement, banks will seek to impose various restrictive covenants. Treasurers need to know that no part of the organisation is doing, or is likely to want to do, anything that could breach those covenants,” explains Hutchings.</p>
<p>It is also important that treasury knows what is coming down the line in terms of major corporate events such as disposals or acquisitions. Kellaway adds: “Treasurers have to go and actively talk to other parts of the organisation, both at inception of the financing but also as an ongoing risk management process.”</p>
<h3 id=""fx-management"">FX management</h3>
<p>“The decisions that treasury takes on hedging can make or break a company. We have a hedging policy in our operating rules, and how to manage the currency exposure is a key question,” says Lenovo’s Glendinning, outlining another evolving and growing treasury task.</p>
<p>Glendinning oversees an important and strategic hedging programme shaped around managing the FX risk that arises from a mismatch between costs and revenue. The computer giant has a dollar-heavy cost base given that many of its key suppliers are US companies, like the chip, hard drive and operating system manufacturers. Yet less than 30% of Lenovo’s revenue is in the same currency, due to sales in China, Europe, Japan and other countries.</p>
<p>And FX risk can be just as dangerous for small and mid-market businesses venturing into new markets as it is for multinationals. A study by the Association of Chartered and Certified Accountants and Kantox, a foreign exchange provider, found that finance officers in SMEs do not usually understand, or sufficiently hedge, foreign exchange risk. Around one-third of companies sampled in 2012 reported that the amount of FX loss, or gain, had exceeded US$1m, resulting in a direct impact on profit margins.</p>
<p>In fact, FX management is such a risk that treasury needs more support from the board, argues Deloitte. According to the consultancy’s 2016 Global Foreign Exchange Survey, corporate boards lack visibility of their company’s current FX exposures. This gives boards a limited ability to challenge and guide FX strategy, and results in some companies being slow to measure the commercial effectiveness of their FX risk management activities. “The impact of FX management on profitability was tracked by less than half of survey respondents, and 21% did not measure performance at all,” explains Karlien Porre, a Partner at Deloitte who leads the treasury advisory team and co-authored the survey.</p>
<p>It could help if boards empowered treasury to be more decisive. “Many corporations tie themselves in knots with bureaucracy and hierarchy when it comes to making a decision around FX,” notes Jonathan Pryor, Head of FX Dealing in Investec’s corporate and institutional treasury department. “It means the market has moved by 3% and the opportunity is lost. Decision makers need to be empowered to make the most of opportunities, yet many bang their heads against a brick wall and make no decision at all.” He adds: “The ideal situation for us it to have the board review its hedging strategy once a year, and leave the day-to-day operations to treasury.”</p>
<p>In turn, treasury needs to ensure much clearer communication with the board regarding FX strategy. Treasurers need “strong communication skills” to ensure the board “clearly understands” the risk treasury faces and how treasury activities add value to the business, argues Porre. “The fact that this communication often happens indirectly via the CFO further adds to this need,” she says. “If a treasurer can’t explain treasury matters succinctly to their CFO in 15 minutes, how would they expect the CFO to explain it to the Board in five minutes?”</p>
<p>Glendinning’s response to the FX burden? Quoting the adage that managers should manage while the role of the board is one of oversight and governance, he believes that treasury has the prime responsibility for managing hedging programmes. While board reviews are more than welcome, and should be encouraged, there are potential issues. “Do boards always have the technical skills to review a hedging programme?” he questions. “There will often be a number of people on the board who do understand it and who have a qualified opinion, but a board member with, say, marketing experience will not. Boards should satisfy themselves that a process exists, and that it is being run competently. If there are indicators that it isn’t, ask questions.”</p>
<h3 id=""get-smart"">Get smart</h3>
<p>As companies’ demands on treasury change, so treasury skills are having to evolve. Today’s treasury needs people with accounting backgrounds and financial market expertise, regulatory knowledge and, importantly, an understanding of where risk lies within a business. It is an expanding skillset echoed in the ACT’s Strategic Treasury Report: 40% of respondents said they were spending more time on risk management compared to a year ago while 64% said their role was more varied than five years ago. Treasurers also reported that operations and controls have declined in focus in recent years.</p>
<p>Yet treasury teams remain small. According to the Nordea Treasury 2017 Survey, conducted by the Swedish financial services provider, the average team is now eight people, up from seven. The report noted that much of the growth in treasury for the largest blue chips has been “involuntary” and driven by a need for more compliance and reporting staff, rather than treasury’s increasingly complex and crucial role. And the compliance mantle, treasurers point out, is not a strategic role.</p>
<p>“The financial regulation that we see is an inconvenience and cost rather than a strategic problem,” says Glendinning. “It is annoying that it takes us six months to open a bank account, but the Board is not asking me about this. Although regulation around currency hedging is making it harder and more expensive, I am paid to manage this.”</p>
<h3 id=""technology-to-the-rescue"">Technology to the rescue</h3>
<p>Technological innovation is key to helping treasury improve efficiency and reduce cost alongside an expanding workload. Maersk is in the process of implementing a whole new treasury system in its largest IT investment in “a long time,” says Burman. In smaller-scale innovation, his team now has software for monitoring and pricing derivatives and improving the company’s hedging capabilities. Burman is also introducing software to help monitor bank fees, thereby boosting transparency. “We deal with quite a few banks and it is important to have fee transparency,” he says. “Going forward we will work on solutions around electronic payments and supply chain finance too.”</p>
<p>The treasury challenge is also helped by access to much more information than in the past, increasing market knowledge and risk awareness. “It used to be a case of treasury showing the board positions from an excel spread sheet,” says Investec’s Pryor. “Now, if a customer trades through us they can see analysis of their entire position. It allows much more informed risk management decisions; they can plot the next 12 months.” It’s a direction of travel that he predicts will see more departments execute and monitor their positions online and put together scenario analysis using banks advisory services.</p>
<h3 id=""visibility"">Visibility</h3>
<p>Treasury also needs clear visibility through the whole company. This helps the department negotiate with commercial teams if market conditions become more challenging, something UK treasury teams have had to do post-Brexit following the fall in sterling to a 30-year low against the dollar. “This was the kind of situation when treasury needed to be able to go to their commercial and sales teams and provide informed and rational arguments as to why costs have risen so dramatically,” said Pryor.</p>
<p>Managing FX risk also increasingly demands strong relationships reaching out through the business, argues Deloitte’s Porre. “Treasurers need to understand FX risk through their whole supply chain; they need to be able to say where their exposure arises, gauge the ability to pass it on and see what the competition is doing.”</p>
<p>Ensuring visibility calls for soft skills like good communication, and a broader ability to persuade and motivate others. Technical and analytical skills are critical but treasury needs people with behavioural skills too – people who can think how does this matter, how does it drive behaviour and how does it impact the bottom line, argues Deloitte’s Porre.</p>
<h3 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Treasury has grown in importance and influence since the financial crisis and is playing a more strategic role around fundraising, cash management and capital allocation. Yet it is worth bearing in mind that this trend is also relative to the financial health of the company. If sales are strong and growing, cash is coming in fast, receivables are collected quickly and margins are high, treasury doesn’t have such a strategic function. “If a company is short of cash, the treasurer is powerful and important. In contrast, if it is a company which is cash rich, treasury is likely to be less central,” concludes Glendinning.</p>

<h3 id=""a-journeys-to-treasury-roadmap"">A journeys to treasury roadmap</h3>
<p>Through the noise and confusion that often seem to be the trademarks of the modern world of finance, a number of crucial questions emerge from all sections of the financial community. What is worth paying attention to? Which technologies are going to impact on my decisions? What trends and initiatives will be truly transformative? Of the many initiatives underway, which will be key to my journey?</p>
<h3 id=""building-on-conversations"">Building on conversations</h3>
<p>Our approach is simple: a conversation between the financial services industry, the systems provider, the consultant and the association of professionals. In Journeys To Treasury, each of the four contributors offers their own expertise gained from their own journeys in this bumpy – yet encouraging – landscape, structured in 3 sections: Continued Innovation, Anytime, Anywhere Treasury and Cybercrime and Fraud.</p>
<p>While basing itself upon the understanding and knowledge of today’s treasury challenges as well as the ability to anticipate the impact of transforming trends, Journeys To Treasury discusses advanced technological solutions and industry initiatives in the making.</p>
<h3 id=""continued-innovation"">Continued innovation</h3>
<p>New entrants and emerging technologies are having a noticeably disruptive impact on the financial sector, with a knock-on effect on the world of corporate treasury. The report addresses their disruptive potential, while assessing corporate treasury’s appetite for innovation that requires a renewed collaborative approach integrating Fintechs.</p>
<h3 id=""anytime-anywhere-treasury"">Anytime, anywhere treasury</h3>
<p>There is a natural and evolving trend towards going mobile and 24/7 banking and, among other things, this will inevitably mean faster payments. Journeys To Treasury delves deep in the concepts of “Anytime, Anywhere Treasury” and discusses the pros and cons of treasuries riding the wave of the ever-increasing fast pace of commerce.</p>
<h3 id=""cybercrime-and-fraud"">Cybercrime and fraud</h3>
<p>As cyberattacks become increasingly common, companies are becoming aware of the fact that it is not if they will be attacked, but when, just as instant and mobile payments increase the susceptibility of the industry to cybercrime and fraud. No area of business can afford to be complacent regarding corporate fraud and hacking. This is especially true for corporate treasuries.</p>
<h3 id=""present-and-future"">Present and future</h3>
<p>Journeys To Treasury offers a pragmatic vision of the present and future of treasury, as seen through the prism of these evolving issues. It is a reference, a roadmap, for corporate treasurers wanting to make their own journey to treasury in this rapidly-changing landscape.</p>
<p>The report will be released during the annual EuroFinance event in Vienna on October 13<sup>th</sup> and will be available for download at <a href=""http://www.journeystotreasury.com"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">www.journeystotreasury.com</a></p>

<p>Vishal Kapoor is the Trade Head for Asia based in Hong Kong, working with the Banking Group to expand trade business. Prior to this he was a part of the Leverage Finance and DCM team. He has a Bachelor of Technology from India’s National Institute of Technology, and a Master’s Degree in Business Management from City University, New York.</p>



<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>When economic growth stalls, businesses must react quickly or face an uncertain future. Whilst in many cases Asian economies are still exhibiting growth levels that their European counterparts can only dream of right now, the slowdown in growth is palpable.</p>
<p>China’s headline growth rates in recent years have often been in excess of 8% (they even scaled above 14% in 2007 following on from the all-time high of 15.40% in Q1 1993). Whilst its economy grew by an annual 6.7% in Q1 2016, compared to 6.8% in the previous period, this is still the weakest growth it has shown since Q1 2009. Indonesia’s GDP grew by 4.79% in 2015 but although this was slightly above expectations, it too marks the country’s slowest growth since 2009. Likewise, Vietnam’s economy expanded 5.46% year-on-year in the three months to March 2016, but this is slowing from the 7% growth seen in the previous period.</p>
<p>This story continues across many other countries in the region and the apparent slow reversal of growth expectation is enough to worry the markets. This creates a knock-on effect that only serves to exacerbate the commercial gloom. For the treasurer, the time is now to make some strategic changes and, for the wise incumbent, these changes should not only cushion the effects of slowing revenues and trade flows now but also act as a buffer for future market fluctuations.</p>
<h3 id=""taking-a-new-approach"">Taking a new approach</h3>
<p>Where companies got rather used to the high-growth environment, many allowed this to drive their corporate structure, with strong growth funding the business and the pressure on delivering operating efficiencies somewhat lower. Moreover, given the benign interest rate environment, most corporates took on more debt not only to fund higher growth but also to meet other strategic priorities including acquisitions, share buybacks and dividends. As growth stagnates, the expenses of running the business may no longer be in proportion with actual growth, explains Vishal Kapoor, Asia Pacific Trade Head, Treasury and Trade Solutions, at Citi. He urges businesses to acknowledge that it is unlikely that their ‘good-times’ structure, including potentially high debt levels, can be sustained as growth slows. Kapoor also advises that preserving debt capacity – which is curtailed in a weak growth environment – and finding alternate ways of improving cash flows becomes paramount in order to maintain the company’s overall financial flexibility.</p>
<p>However, he warns that the necessary response to a slowing of growth may not always be one that can be enacted at the press of a button. A company in the middle of a capital expenditure project, for example, will not easily be able to stop or reverse plans which were commenced during the economic heyday. Because operating costs are not generally driven by the same economic principles as sales growth, Kapoor observes that key metrics such as EBITDA may start to drop rapidly at the hands of the lag that exists between the implementation of improving measures, and those measures taking effect. Furthermore, where a high-growth environment has been assumed, support of the cash cycle has perhaps seen less of a focus – but as the outlook weakens and the top line becomes more volatile, pressure to revisit the working capital cycle increases.</p>
<h3 id=""mutual-support-network"">Mutual support network</h3>
<p>As the realisation hits home that growth is slowing, Kapoor strongly advises companies to embark on a strategic review of processes and operations, with the aim of re-aligning their business models to cater to the new normal. With cash flow falling away and reliance on cheap debt no longer sustainable, the need is to find new ways to rebuild and sustain growth, he says. The first major constituent of this undertaking is to eke out improvements in operating efficiency, looking at the entire working capital cycle. The second is to find new models of growth stimulation which, he suggests, may not come via traditional methods but instead be derived from the support of the company’s clients.</p>
<p>A fundamental change is proposed here: treasurers need to work a lot closer with the sales function and vice versa. The two are seemingly at the mercy of conflicting purposes: finance managers may feel that the issue of timely payment is never given enough importance in client discussions, whilst conversely sales managers may argue that credit constraints adversely impact relationships with clients – and seemingly never the twain shall meet. However, Kapoor believes and stresses that closer alignment between these two functions is possible and indeed beneficial. Treasury even has an opportunity to intermediate between sales colleagues and external banking partners, with treasury positioning itself as the means of facilitating revenue growth.</p>
<p>As an example of how this co-operation might be made concrete, Kapoor cites the formation within some forward-thinking companies of hybrid ‘sales finance’ teams, motivated to steer working capital and revenue issues in a new and positive direction.</p>
<h3 id=""ideas-in-action"">Ideas in action</h3>
<p>The customer benefit with such a setup may manifest directly through the in-house financing of purchases. However, suppliers could also exploit internal sales/finance collaboration by offering longer terms to customers, mitigating the risk of those terms by selling the receivables to its bank. By working in partnership with the finance team, Kapoor explains that the sales function can extend terms of payment without damaging cash flow. Companies can look to deploy these terms in conjunction with or in lieu of ‘other’ volume or price discounts to drive higher sales from its buyers. Such a move incentivises the buyer to purchase more as it reduces its working capital and also positively impacts its return on capital.</p>
<p>With the trend of extending terms taking place across most industry segments, Kapoor also notes that many industrial companies are purchasing high-value goods and services and pushing out payments for as long as 24 to 36 months. Corporates wishing to sell into this environment clearly face a dilemma. The desire – and even the policy conditions – that would allow a company to take such a risk would be unlikely in a buoyant market. As revenues begin to slip, the company has to decide whether to forgo that sales opportunity or find a way to mitigate the risk.</p>
<p>In order to mitigate the risk, Kapoor says that depending on the credit worthiness of the buyer, various forms of payment and credit enhancements can be considered – for example through purchase of credit insurance or asking the buyer to make payment under a letter of credit (LC) or even through the provision of a stand by LC. As a result the company is able to mitigate tenor extension risk and make the structure more bankable thereby allowing it to seek financing and actively manage its cash flows. There are, he further notes, a number of examples of industrial corporates successfully adopting this approach including for medium to large value sales.</p>
<p>For smaller-value trades such as in FMCG, although currently experiencing less of a sales slow-down, Kapoor says growth can be sustained and even increased through portfolio financing solutions. Here, for example, a large corporate supplier can partner with a bank to sell receivables due from a large number of buyers on a programmed basis. Such solutions typically benefit from either a credit wrap, provided by a large insurer that covers commercial and political risks related to the buyers, or some sort of credit risk sharing arrangement between the corporate and the bank.</p>
<p>However it is achieved, the onus to seek out models of growth enablement is clearly about partnership, says Kapoor. The needs of all internal parties must be identified but it is also important for the bank to engage with its client on the business side, not just on the finance side, “to better understand how best to facilitate that growth”.</p>
<h3 id=""partnering-for-success"">Partnering for success</h3>
<p>It is apparent that the slowing down of growth has seen the increased collaboration of two sides that historically have not always been quite so communicative. With the banking community having also stepped up its involvement in both corporate finance and business matters, it has been necessary for banks to ensure all points of contact have the right skills and understanding to meet the advanced (and advancing) needs of clients. “The tools are the same, but it is how we use those tools in the context of growth to solve some of the challenges that our clients face that makes the difference,” notes Kapoor. Banks need to “better understand the needs of corporates in this changing environment” for this partnership to yield positive results.</p>
<p>The current climate is such that the intelligent adaptation by a bank of its product portfolio is well-received by corporate clients. But for banks to deliver real value, Kapoor believes lateral thinking about its own products and processes, and its clients’ strategies, tactics and policies, should benefit the recipient as part of a sustained, and sustainable, programme of support. “Through good times and bad we continue to assist clients in supporting their business growth and helping to set some new best practices,” he comments.</p>
<p>But Kapoor points out that this usually requires a customised approach. As each client’s circumstances are unique he says it is “more solution-oriented than product-oriented and we need to find the best fit for the client’s need”.</p>
<p>Ultimately, all stakeholders – both internal and external – are called upon to react to the demands of a dynamic growth environment, eking out advantage wherever possible. It thus behoves the quick-witted treasurer to collaborate with those other stakeholders to establish what Kapoor calls an “evergreen” response – one that will outlast any short-term buffeting by the markets, providing security long into the future. The root of success in this instance may be a declining market but, as he asserts, “adversity creates opportunity”.</p>

<p>Whichever way one looks at it, the demands being placed on corporate treasurers have never been greater and new innovative strategies and approaches to treasury management are needed in response. But corporates cannot be alone in this endeavour. To overcome these challenges there is a need to work with best-in-class partners and also operate in an environment that offers the full spectrum of treasury solutions and expertise.</p>
<p>Here, three highly experienced treasury practitioners, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and Thomson Reuters, discuss the treasury landscape in Asia and whether a centralised operation based in Singapore might help corporates meet the challenges of both today and tomorrow.</p>
<h4>Let’s start by asking the corporates – why have you centralised and why are you based here in Singapore?</h4>

<p><strong>Jarno Timmerman, Head of Treasury Asia Pacific, AkzoNobel:</strong> There have always been discussions around the centralisation and regionalisation of treasury activities and how processes can be automated centrally using various systems. And there is lots of value to be had by empowering a hub, be it here in Singapore or elsewhere, to support business operations in the region. It has enabled us to develop an in-depth understanding of the difficulties faced in each country across the region.</p>
<p>At AkzoNobel we have quite a complex organisation with entities that do business-to-business or business-to-consumer and given the different regulations and complexities in the region there is a lot of value for us to have the hub here. It has enabled us to develop an in-depth understanding of the difficulties faced in each country.</p>


<p><strong>Sonia Clifton-Bligh, Head of Regional Treasury Centre Asia Pacific, Johnson &amp; Johnson:</strong> Whilst Johnson &amp; Johnson’s treasury function (J&amp;J) is centralised and primarily run out of Europe, there is huge benefit to us being in APAC and here in Singapore. The country has numerous benefits including its well-developed infrastructure, the talent pool and ability to access experts across all areas of finance. Moreover, there is core business leadership based in Singapore as well. Treasury is very much an advisor to the business so we really do need to be close to the business.</p>



<p><img alt=""Thomson Reuters"" class=""logo"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/logo/thomson-reuters-logo-2013-168x37.png?la=en&amp;hash=3B4AE0952CBF1042511D947CF87B57B9"" width=""168""/></p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p><strong>Damian Glendinning, Corporate Treasurer, Lenovo:</strong> We have taken a slightly different route in that we are highly centralised and don’t operate regional hubs – everything is done out of Singapore with very few exceptions.</p>
<p>Why Singapore? When Lenovo bought IBM’s PC division 11 years ago we ended up with a business structure where all of the international flows, and of course in our case international flows means flows outside China, were all going through Singapore. So Singapore was the logical place for treasury to be located.</p>
<p>It continues to be here primarily because we have found that it works very well. There is a deep talent pool and also there is a huge pool of resources in terms of banks, service providers and so on.</p>


<p><strong>Sanjeev Chatrath, Region Head and Managing Director, Asia, Thomson Reuters, Financial &amp; Risk:</strong> From a Thomson Reuters perspective, we have been in Singapore for more than 100 years and given its position as a financial hub it is really important for our business to be present here. We have nearly a thousand people based here, as well as operating data centres which again is testimony to the infrastructure in Singapore, and this supports us across the entire region.</p>
<p>Also, there are some well-developed economies in Asia where the rule of law governs the conduct of commerce. Singapore is definitely one such market, which is hence very attractive to us from a corporate point of view.</p>

<h4>So there are various factors that make Singapore an attractive hub. But it seems that treasury also has to be close to the business?</h4>

<p><strong>Bernard Wee, Executive Director, Financial Markets Development and Payments &amp; Technology Solutions, Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS):</strong> The treasury function follows the business. And Singapore has traditionally been a regional hub for MNCs doing business across ASEAN. But today, being located in Singapore is not just about being in ASEAN or even selling into ASEAN, it is about selling to emerging economies such as India and China as well and as the business grows, and its regional functions grow, it just makes sense to put that treasury in Singapore to manage FX risk and cash flows.</p>
<p>In addition, it is interesting to see that everybody around the table is from a different country. Singapore is a multicultural and cosmopolitan hub – it is able to be a home to people from different parts of the world and offer an attractive community and environment for both businesses and families.</p>


<p><strong>Chatrath, Thomson Reuters:</strong> Adding to what Bernard said, Singapore certainly has a lot to offer. It must be remembered however that for treasury centres it really depends on where the weight in that organisation is. If you have got relatively small business in Asia and are heavily weighted towards US and Europe, maybe London is a good alternative to consider, as opposed to having an outpost sitting in Asia. Moreover, those companies with a substantial presence in China might operate a treasury centre on the mainland dedicated to managing China operations, and then another that manages the rest of Asia.</p>
<p>The location of choice ultimately depends on the context of the organisation. Additionally, in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, with advanced technology, I think organisations are finding that they don’t have to be geographically located in a particular centre, because a lot of day-to-day operations can be off-shored. Treasury is really about policies and setting the right processes in the organisations.</p>

<p><strong>Clifton-Bligh, Johnson &amp; Johnson:</strong> Yes, I would agree with that, but I think it is not just about what a business is doing today, it is about how it will grow and where this growth will occur. Treasury needs to be close to this growth and help support the business in navigating the various nuanced rules found across the region’s markets. And when you take on an advisory role to the business I think that being close to the geographies you are dealing with makes a lot of sense.</p>


<p><strong>Glendinning, Lenovo:</strong> I completely agree. Also, I think a lot depends on the business and how it has chosen to organise itself. Empowered regional hubs are great, provided the organisation can sustain the cost that it brings and get a benefit from it.</p>
<p>Obviously, treasury is there to support the business and not the other way round. But technically, you can actually do everything from everywhere. The issue is what additional benefit you get from having people in a certain place rather than another.</p>

<h4>What can Singapore do to encourage more corporates to come as well as maintaining its current position?</h4>

<p><strong>Wee, MAS:</strong> When we look at various surveys, Singapore typically emerges as the number one location for those companies looking to establish a treasury centre in the region. But close behind are Hong Kong and Shanghai.</p>
<p>So how is Singapore looking to maintain its position? If you look at how Asia is developing, you have the large economies of Japan and China. But there are also other huge emerging economies, most notably India and Indonesia. Both these countries have tremendous growth potentially and for businesses the growth potentially comes from being able to do business in these two big economies.</p>
<p>The challenge for Singapore is to maintain access and be conducive to developments in these diverse markets in Asia for those corporates domiciled here. Moreover, we have to understand the difficulties that companies face when doing business in these countries and help treasury centres manage this risk. To do this effectively, treasurers require access to a comprehensive ecosystem of financial services. Essentially, we are positioning Singapore to be a node amongst these diverse markets, be it as an offshore RMB hub, a yen FX risk management centre, or an offshore rupee bond raising venue.</p>

<h4>And how are you looking to develop this ecosystem?</h4>

<p><strong>Wee, MAS:</strong> Singapore is taking a broad view and I am not just speaking about creating an ecosystem of treasury services. Take, for example, insurance. Corporates need access to trade credit insurance, political risk insurance, or even marine hull insurance. These products enable trade, which allows investment to be safeguarded in difficult markets.</p>
<p>There is a good ecosystem of providers of insurance who are able to offer these solutions. But also we are working on developing new solutions for new types of risks. For example, countries in Asia Pacific sit on the Ring of Fire, where roughly 90% of all earthquakes occur. And if you look at the past ten years, there have been numerous incidents that have not only impacted the location of the disasters but also the wider region. One of the things that we are therefore working on is enabling natural catastrophe insurance protection.</p>
<p>But back to the original question on ‘how are you protecting Singapore’s role as a leading financial centre and as a leading location for treasury centres?’ For me we are doing this by not just looking to be a good treasury hub, but by being a centre that offers complete financial solutions for all parts of the business.</p>


<p><strong>Glendinning, Lenovo:</strong> It’s very interesting to hear that and I think we all agree that whilst theoretically you can manage your treasury operations with a computer linked to the internet from anywhere, there is additional value to be obtained by being based in a finance centre. The main benefit being that you are able to talk to industry experts across a whole spectrum of things, not just in terms of things like cash management.</p>
<p>However, another challenge I see in the region is protectionism. India and Indonesia were previously mentioned, these are two countries which present a lot of challenges, and one of the challenges is a slight tendency towards protectionism, particularly in the financial services area. So how do you see this impacting what Singapore can offer?</p>


<p><strong>Wee, MAS:</strong> Protectionism occurs in different ways and this is occurring across the region. If you look at Singapore however and its network of trade agreements, we have 21 free trade agreements, and the ASEAN Economic Committee is only something that you can only participate in if you are in ASEAN.</p>
<p>In addition, we strike strategic partnerships with our neighbours. We have a comprehensive economic cooperation agreement with India which is highly favourable. So whilst some markets are turning inwards, we are working very hard to build bilateral access channels for all companies that are operating in Singapore.</p>

<h4>Are these new challenges or more of the same?</h4>

<p><strong>Chatrath, Thomson Reuters:</strong> If we sat together having a similar conversation, perhaps 15 years ago, it actually would not have been very different. At that time there was talk about the tiger economies, the potential that Asia had in terms of growth and the fact that you could cover a lot of the region from a hub like Singapore. There has been a lot of growth in the region past few decades.</p>
<p>What seems to be different now, is that alongside that focus on growth is an equal focus on it being sustainable growth. I think that sustainability is becoming critical especially in terms of risk and compliance.</p>
<p>The second thing is the quantum of volatility in the markets. It has been fairly unprecedented if you think across every asset class. That poses its own set of challenges to many of the treasurers.</p>
<p>A third challenge that jumps up is the point Bernard made around risk management. A number of risks that most of the companies are exposed to – whether it is operational risk, FX risk or regulatory risk – tend to be very high. A lot of these risks are perhaps even extraterritorial. The quantum of the regulatory network and the implication of that tends to be far reaching.</p>
<p>And the last difference is the advent of new technology, which has encouraged a number of companies to actually look at establishing offshore centres to become more efficient and achieve benefits of scale. But at the same time this has also brought in a number of new challenges because it means that data is actually being stored outside of a particular jurisdiction. This means cyber security is becoming a bigger focus.</p>
<p>Treasury departments and the role of the treasurer has evolved significantly over the years, and there is a greater need to be agile, while also doing more with less, often remotely.</p>
<p>As a result, I see the role actually gaining more stature within the corporate hierarchy, because treasury has to be a custodian of the organisation’s assets, whether these be financial assets or even cash flows. And to fulfil that responsibility, treasury needs to be thinking much broader now than what it was many years ago.</p>


<p><strong>Timmerman, AkzoNobel:</strong> What you also see happening is that because the technology is there and you can do everything from everywhere, everything also needs to happen faster. But, when everything is automated and real-time, it creates additional risk and increased volatility.</p>
<p>Further complexity is added because in Asia regulation means that we cannot optimally use the technology at our disposal. For instance, we have our electronic trading platforms integrated into our daily operations, but sometimes it is very difficult to apply that in different countries. Not technically, but because you still need to have the discussion with the regulator.</p>
<p>So it all needs to happen today. Complexity and uncertainty and the fact that it all needs to go quicker adds to the volatility already in the market. And that is the biggest struggle I see today for us as a regional centre: how do we manage that?</p>


<p><strong>Clifton-Bligh, Johnson &amp; Johnson:</strong> I think there is a lot of risk. We have core policies and globally we’ll manage those policies but you have to balance that with the agility that’s often warranted in markets where you do have to move a lot faster. The balance is the biggest challenge and that’s where you need the expertise in the market. And the closer you are to the market, the deeper that expertise.</p>

<p><strong>Timmerman, AkzoNobel:</strong> And often it is not only the in-country regulations. As previously mentioned, extraterritorial regulations are also a challenge. For instance, if I want to set up a new FX relationship in a particular country, and doing this involves a European bank. Then I will need to speak with my local CFO or to my local controller about EMIR and help them to complete the documentation.</p>
<p>How on earth am I going to explain to a local controller what EMIR is about? He sometimes doesn’t even know the difference between spot and forward, right? So this is a very difficult and time consuming process for the treasury.</p>


<p><strong>Chatrath, Thomson Reuters:</strong> That’s a great point. Last year we tracked about 600 different regulators around the world and there were over 50,000 regulatory changes just in 2015. That is over 150 regulatory changes every single day.</p>
<p>Now, whilst the vast majority of those don’t directly impact a particular corporate. They often impact the financial institutions that you do business with, and hence in turn it impacts you because their view of you is going to evolve. It is not static.</p>
<p>Take for example Basel III, this has far reaching consequences because as a corporate you now have to think very carefully about your service providers and who can provide you with more sustainable capital commitment and resilient infrastructure going forward.</p>


<p><strong>Glendinning, Lenovo:</strong> You raise a very good point, but when I look at which of the countries give me the most concern from a regulatory point of view, it’s not Asia. It’s not the emerging markets. It is the United States and it is Europe, where frankly there’s a complete avalanche of regulations.</p>
<p>I would say a lot of the developed markets have taken their cue from Asia – regulate first and think second. As a result, there are just so many different regulations and so many contradictions because the EU and the US can’t agree on all manner of things. This often means that you can be in compliance with one and not with the other at any given time.</p>
<p>We are beginning to see the same thing here in Asia however. For example, when it comes to trying to manage FX risk, one of the most important tools in the international treasurer’s toolkit is the offshore NDF (non-deliverable forward) market, particularly if you’re dealing with a regulated currency. Yet, a lot of the rules around derivatives have had a negative impact on liquidity in these markets and therefore a negative impact on pricing, at least from the corporates’ point of view. The regulations which are designed to protect the system are in fact increasing the cost of risk management and making it much more difficult to do it.</p>

<h4>Can I ask you, Bernard, to respond on these regulatory points? Does over-regulation worry you?</h4>

<p><strong>Wee, MAS:</strong> No. When it comes to regulation, it is about striking a good balance between meeting international standards, being a responsible international financial centre to avoid regulatory arbitrage and yet catering to our own market characteristics.</p>
<p>It is also about keeping regulation flexible enough so that business can continue to operate. We are a small country with a strong financial centre and we do what we can to keep regulation sensible for companies. When you look at, say, setting thresholds for companies to clear derivative transactions like interest rate swaps, I think you have to be very sensible about what sizes of companies you really want to include.</p>
<p>And while there is an international trend in the years since the financial crisis, towards more transparency, more reporting, and more regulation, we have to also strike a balance to the value add of the increased transparency and use of these reported information.</p>


<p><strong>Glendinning, Lenovo:</strong> You have also got the Volcker Rule which means that in the past they could warehouse the risk and now they can’t.</p>


<p><strong>Wee, MAS:</strong> Exactly. And many of these things are really outside of our control. So what can we do within our control to provide alternate solutions to companies to manage FX risk. As an example, we have worked with the exchange to launch a suite of Asian currency futures as a transparent and well-regulated alternative for risk management. The suite is not all comprehensive yet but we are building it up.</p>

<h4>What other challenges are there or what else is on the corporate wish list at present?</h4>

<p><strong>Glendinning, Lenovo:</strong> We are all struggling with the regulations, but very clearly that is not an Asian phenomenon, it is coming from the West. So it doesn’t matter where you are based, there will always be issues with this. I do think however, that any regulator in the region that can try and alleviate some of the regulatory pressure and make it easier for corporates to operate will be very welcomed by the corporate community.</p>
<p>Another challenge and opportunity is the huge change that we are seeing in the financial system at present. The advent of fintech now means that transactions can be made using a host of non-bank providers who often have much better technology than the banks, and who often are not so strictly regulated.</p>
<p>Personally I think that the whole transaction world is going to look very different in a few years’ time. That obviously is going to have another big impact on the banks and on the way we work. For me, that is probably the biggest challenge that we all face.</p>


<p><strong>Timmerman, AkzoNobel:</strong> I agree, fintech is a big focus and it is a space that is developing very quickly. The more cutting edge technology corporates can use, the better it will be for the whole industry.</p>
<p>But, at present, what is even more pressing is the environment that we as corporates are operating in. There has been lots of work done to develop ASEAN as an economic community that includes initiatives around the standardisation of bilateral activity when it comes to trade. But it still remains a very difficult environment and the countries and their currencies remain individual and it is not a unified region.</p>
<p>As a treasury department we are not only looking to optimise what we do, but also work together with the business to optimise it end-to-end. So given Singapore’s position as a financial centre for ASEAN and Asia more broadly we would like to see it play a driving role to ensure that there can at least be the free flow of capital within ASEAN. This would help a lot when we work with procurement who are currently sourcing raw materials in some of the regions highly restricted economies. Then if the financial flow and invoicing goes through Singapore this will allow us to fine tune the FX flows, which permits us to lead and lag internally when it comes to working capital flows.</p>


<p><strong>Chatrath, Thomson Reuters:</strong> It is a really good discussion. I think it is a credit to MAS that we are able to engage in a conversation such as this across the table. It is reflective of the progressive nature of the economy and I find many progressive regulators engaging in a similar conversation, trying to understand what are the intended and unintended consequences of their regulations. So I think it is really great to see a regulator that is keen to engage and support the economy.</p>
<p>When it comes to Fintech, I see a number of developments which will be very important for us to observe closely moving forward. Payments industry is at an exciting stage in its evolution. Similarly, new crowd funding and visualisation solutions are surfacing regularly.</p>
<p>There is also a lot of interest in fintech, but it is still very early days. We will have to watch how that plays out.</p>

<h4>What about KYC, this is a big issue at present, can technology help with this?</h4>

<p><strong>Chatrath, Thomson Reuters:</strong> KYC has been a pressing issue for corporates for a while now and it is an interesting phenomena where the cost of compliance is borne by the corporate treasurer either directly or indirectly. And there is clearly a lot of demand to reduce this cost and make the process easier. A desire to move to a utility-like model, because not every financial institution is able to develop a solution by themselves, may therefore be the answer.</p>
<p>And I am very encouraged to see the trend of moving toward a common industry-wide utility in a market so that the buy side and the corporate provides documentation one time and authorises access to it, to the different financial institutions. That I think is a more sustainable, efficient, and more compliant way of doing it as opposed to everybody doing it individually.</p>
<p>I am also seeing a lot of those tools around KYC being deployed around supply chain and counterparty management. In particular we have seen a strong interest around supply chain due diligence solutions. Corporates now want to know that the people they are doing business with, are who they say they are.</p>
<p>Many Corporates are building up their war chest because they are realising that they have got to have a sufficient amount of liquid assets to respond to geopolitical risk, whether terrorism-linked, environmentally-linked or politically-linked, and hence you are seeing liquid assets continuing to build up, maybe perhaps as a consequence of quantitative easing.</p>
<p>I am also finding many of them using technology to become more agile and precise. I think cash forecasting is a good example of it, where companies are deploying augmented intelligence to get an accurate insight into their positions. Decision are being made on data, not gut-feel and this will only grow in the future.</p>

<h4>China was previously mentioned and this is a country that of course receives massive amounts of attention. Damian, given that you work for a Chinese corporate, what are your views on what is happening?</h4>
<figure style=""float:left;margin:0.5em 2em 2em 0;"">

<p><strong>Glendinning, Lenovo:</strong> China is obviously a huge and very important market. And clearly China is under-represented in the global financial system compared to its weight in the global economy, and that is something which cannot, and will not, last. So we are seeing that change.</p>
<p>In terms of the renminbi, I guess I am a little bit of a heretic because I just view it as another currency. It happens to have more regulations around it than most other currencies and China being China those regulations are usually not clear, at least until you find you have done something wrong. But those regulations are evolving.</p>
<p>The situation today is not normal. The world’s second-largest economy has a currency which is not the second most traded currency. There are reasons why the currency is being held back however, and those reasons have everything to do with China’s stage of development in the management of its economy and that will be resolved over time.</p>
<p>So for most corporates, it is just another currency, but one that cannot be traded as freely as you would like. The infrastructure is being put in place to do so but challenges remain. For example, hedging the renminbi is still extremely expensive and has just been made more expensive. Again, part of that is due to some of the distortions in the international financial market, and nothing to do with China. But these things will even out over time.</p>

<h4>How can Singapore become a better platform for corporates to manage their China treasury activities?</h4>

<p><strong>Chatrath, Thomson Reuters:</strong> There is a lot of opportunity here and I think Singapore is favourably placed not just to assist with the inbound business, but also the outbound business. With the ‘One Belt, One Road’ initiative, I am beginning to see real traction around how China is investing in infrastructure both in ASEAN and beyond which is very encouraging. I also see that there is more and more desire for Chinese institutions to go global.</p>
<p>There are now more than 100 Chinese corporates listed on Singapore Stock Exchange (SGX), for instance, and there are more than a 100 renminbi-dominated bonds that are traded on SGX. These are the early shoots that are beginning to grow the renminbi into a more mainstream currency. So clearly corporates see the potential that the renminbi and China has going forward.</p>

<h4>Bernard, what else is Singapore doing to maintain its position as an attractive treasury hub for corporates?</h4>

<p><strong>Wee, MAS:</strong> The key area is documentary trade: we talk about invoicing through Singapore. The next generation national trade platform aims to on board the financial institutions (FI) as well.</p>
<p>FIs need to be able to see to all the documents from the freight forwarder. If your bank can streamline its collection of documents through a single portal, it really enables the bank to provide more streamlined services to companies, to treasurers, without having to collect paper documents. And as you are able to digitise more invoices, you are actually also able to create a marketplace for invoice financing.</p>
<p>We are also enabling banks to recycle their balance sheets so those invoices that have already been financed can be accrued in alternative capital from non-banks and banks which are not currently participating in trade financing, to securitise those invoices they already finance. That is how we see the national trade platform, building out over the next three to five years.</p>
<p>The final area is around payments. Faster payments are an important development in ASEAN. Singapore has built the real-time 24/7 faster payments platform. We know that Thailand and Malaysia are building their own faster payments platforms. If you can make real-time payments around the clock in each market in local currency that enables interoperability between faster payments in different markets.</p>
<p>In addition, at the recent Singapore Budget, the Minister of Finance has extended the Finance and Treasury Centre (FTC) incentive until 31<sup>st</sup> March 2021. The scheme has also been enhanced in three key ways. Firstly, it will grant approved treasury centres a reduced concessionary 8% tax rate, of course with additional substance requirements as a quid pro quo. Secondly, the fund sourcing rules are relaxed so that funds can come indirectly from associated companies now. Finally, the withholding tax exemption will now include interest on deposits placed by non-resident approved offices and associated companies, provided the funds are used for qualifying purposes. While tax is not the most important factor, as reflected by other participants at the roundtable, we hope this attributes to many of the factors that have kept Singapore attractive as the regional treasury hub.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Despite the best efforts of corporate due diligence, there is no economy in the world that will reveal in advance its hand in quite the level of detail that companies would like. For trade in the emerging markets (EM), the concern that it generates may be amplified many times over. Whilst the ground can to an extent be prepared in advance, the everyday experience of operating in a volatile market will at times be challenging. If not properly managed, the attendant risks could prove costly.</p>
<p>For the treasurer, anticipating risk is par for the course. However, at a broader level, the difference between thriving in a volatile market and merely surviving depends not only on putting the right processes in place as early as possible but also on the quality of advice received.</p>
<p>The strategic intent to tap into low-cost growth markets will likely mean new trading partners on the procurement and sales sides. This potentially introduces several new risk elements – especially around the handling of new currencies. The role of treasury thus takes on a new importance in the EM space. The ability to quickly and precisely establish what this means from a funding, liquidity and cash management perspective could be the difference between success and very expensive failure.</p>
<h3 id=""advisory-role"">Advisory role</h3>
<p>It is no coincidence then that in the last few years the corporate landscape has witnessed the emergence of treasury as an advisory function. In their capacity as a trusted resource, Peter Cunningham, Consumer &amp; Healthcare sector Sales Head for EMEA, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi, believes treasurers are increasingly called upon to bring their knowledge to the table. This is notably the case when a company is seriously looking to expand into new territories, and in particular the EMs. By bringing pragmatic, fact-based input, the treasurer enables the business “to make more informed decisions”, he says.</p>
<p>The knowledge-based approach of the treasurer traverses a broad sweep of concerns, bringing aspects such as sovereign risk, counterparty risk, operational risk and regulatory risk into sharp relief, alongside the treasury fundamentals. It thus becomes the role of the treasurer-educator to raise awareness across the business of potential hazards. In practice, Cunningham suggests that it may be more effective to influence other business functions by tapping into the common KPIs and scorecards used by the CFO, using that office as the focal point of change.</p>
<p>Where the risks of emerging market trade are as clear as the benefits, it may even be prudent to consider an organisational or structural rethink to facilitate lines of communication and learning. However, as EM trade becomes established and business risks become tangible, it is apparent to Cunningham that in some cases the significance of this initial set-up phase has not been fully recognised. “They may have a well thought out strategy and business plan but that organisational element is critical,” he warns.</p>
<p>Once a business has found its EM feet, the role of treasurer takes on renewed importance. The management of working capital, and in particular the cash conversion cycle, will be determined to a large extent by the nature of the commercial relationship the business has with its customers and suppliers. In many large businesses there will be silos of operation which can generate conflicting objectives – sales may not consider how the offer to clients of extended terms to secure a contract may negatively impact days sales outstanding and free cash flow. This, says Cunningham, is why CFO sponsorship and organisational alignment are so important. Whilst policy can be imposed across the board, EM trade often requires flexibility. With the right support, the treasury advisory role can help strike the right balance and offer solutions where necessary.</p>
<h3 id=""keep-it-liquid"">Keep it liquid</h3>
<p>In the current phase of commodity market volatility lower prices can be beneficial to many corporates’ material input costs. However, in counterpoint, Cunningham notes that plummeting prices may impair revenues of suppliers, many of whom are EM-based. As a result, if the ability to fund their own cash conversion cycle is weakened, the stability of the supply chain becomes a matter of extreme concern to all. In this case, working capital solutions such as supply chain finance and dynamic discounting can be used as a means of injecting essential supply chain liquidity.</p>
<p>As a liquidity solution this may also tackle one of the key differences found between developed and emerging territories when managing routes to market, notes Cunningham. A fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) business, for instance, will sell into large and generally liquid retailers, often multinationals, tending not to generate immediate working capital concerns. In the EM space, often the route is via smaller retailers, wholesalers or distributors. These will almost certainly be weaker-rated than their major global or multinational counterparts. However, he advises, the focus is now on implementing sales-channel finance structures which enable channel partners to defer payment terms, facilitating increased sales for the FMCG company as their partner is able to fund their own working capital cycle. “This can be a solution where a corporate sees latent demand for its products in an emerging market but does not want those smaller distributors to be a choke point in realising that market share or sales growth.”</p>
<h3 id=""currency-matters"">Currency matters</h3>
<p>On the other side of the coin, from a payments perspective, as companies build commercial relationships in EM territories, one of the key judgements will be around mitigation of FX volatility risk, says Emanuela Saccarola, Global Product Manager Cross-Currency Payments Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi. In Latin America, for example, where certain currencies have devalued significantly over the past 18 months, suppliers have been seeking payment in local currency. Whereas some suppliers have tried to outsource the FX risk to the buyer, where invoicing in local currency has been agreed, she notes a trend towards the negotiation of better terms or lower unit costs for the buyer as they take on FX volatility – a risk, she adds, which they can then mitigate by hedging or making payments through a bank-provided cross-currency solution.</p>
<p>Regardless of the direction of cash flow, for many businesses the EM regulatory environment means trapped liquidity remains a threat, despite the best efforts of core countries such as China to liberalise. The means deployed to handle this issue will depend on corporate need, says Saccarola. Having a manufacturing and sales function in-country can easily create a natural currency hedge of receivables and payables, if desired. But if a company needs to invest significantly in an EM operation before it sees a major return, it will have a funding choice to make. This, she notes, will be contingent upon the desire or ability for cash to be sourced from a central operation, or risk keeping it in-country. Especially at the beginning, sourcing cash centrally through a cross-currency payments solution may be the smarter approach leading to increased visibility and control, cash management efficiencies, and smaller risks. A global bank like Citi can power the EM investment stage, provide ongoing advice, and seamlessly support a company’s transition to a local solution if and when required.</p>
<p>Of course, the need is to optimise the funding of local subsidiaries wherever they are. Forecasting the requirement for cash and using intercompany funding on an ‘as needed’ basis should ensure excess capital is not injected locally. But when cash balances are built up, it would be provident of treasury to explore options such as periodic dividend repatriation or royalty payments.</p>
<h3 id=""a-profitable-partnership"">A profitable partnership</h3>
<p>Even where cash is trapped locally, Cunningham argues the need to observe the treasury fundamentals of security, liquidity and yield when managing short-term excess cash. It is here, he believes, that partnership with a global banking group such as Citi can deliver tangible benefits. “Often where a multinational has operations across highly regulated markets, we can work to compensate them on a multi-country basis,” he explains. “Cash may be trapped but we can take a holistic view of deposits and provide yield-uptick on balances across different markets.”</p>
<p>Such a view also yields results where none might be expected. Where counterparty trading-partner concerns require the use of financial risk mitigation tools such as Letters of Credit (LCs), or where perhaps local rules require the issuance of guarantees, it may be possible to cash collateralise those risk products. From a Basel III perspective, a bank issuing an LC or guarantee as a straightforward product would price each based in part on its balance-sheet treatment. Cash collateralisation will afford the bank balance sheet relief under Basel III, lowering overheads. By generating an implied yield on the cost differential – which may be more attractive than a short-term investment of similar tenor – it becomes “an effective way of recycling cash,” notes Cunningham.</p>
<h3 id=""the-value-of-connections"">The value of connections</h3>
<p>In EM trade, the benefits of a well-connected banking partner both on and offshore are without question. A bank that offers multiple solutions globally that also has fully integrated streams – whether those flows are initiated centrally or locally by the client – is, says Saccarola, “advantageous”. Core activities such as in-country account opening, cross-currency payments and direct access to local clearing are today perhaps a given. However in providing global visibility and control, a bank must also be well-positioned with people on the ground who are not only able to determine and advise on the most appropriate solutions for the client, especially around regulatory and reporting aspects, but who also understand the local language and culture. “A proprietary network and access in all key EMs is an intangible value to clients,” says Saccarola.</p>
<p>There is perhaps one further desirable facility that few banks can claim with any legitimacy and for Cunningham this is a clear differentiator at Citi. By combining its strong local presence with its weight as a global systemically important bank, the bank has access to the world’s regulators and central banks. “We are often the voice of our clients when talking to these bodies about policy-setting and advisory matters,” he explains. “When trading in EM territories, having a partner such as Citi allows direct communication with the authorities.” In fact, in an unpredictable world, staying connected may well be the strategy that makes the difference.</p>

Treasury Today Asia looks at how ‘best-in-class’ can be achieved and, keeping one eye on the horizon, how it can be maintained.</em></p>
<p>‘Best-in-class’ is a well-worn term often bestowed on technology but when it comes to treasury, no matter how good the tools, if the strategy, structure, processes and people are not similarly at peak performance then the function may be found wanting. In today’s volatile global environment just ‘getting by’ is unlikely to be good enough. Indeed, despite the term ‘best-in-class’ being somewhat subjective, there is something of an imperative to fulfil the notion that what is being delivered really is the best it can be.</p>
<p>“Best-in-class is about doing your utmost to make sure that you serve your corporate strategy as close as possible,” comments Ingmar Bergmann, Corporate Treasurer &amp; Head of Corporate Finance at publicly listed real-estate investment company, NSI. In a similar vein, Denis Ecknauer, APAC Regional Treasurer at global engineering firm, ABB, believes that a best-in-class treasury must be seen as “a key internal function capable of adding value and supporting the company’s business portfolio”.</p>
<p>Given that no two companies are exactly alike, finding a suitable yardstick by which to measure ‘best’ is not always easy. Notwithstanding this difficulty, the key to improvement lies first in being able to fully understand the company’s internal processes, and then always being open to new ideas, of which Bergmann suggests looking to the market – at conferences, seminars and your peer group, for example – “to try to understand where necessary improvements can be made”.</p>
<p>Cost pressure is often at the root of any change but finding new ways of optimising the cost and effort underpinning standard processes will enable the shift of energy towards the more strategic involvement of treasury: automation of standard processes frees up skilled personnel for more cerebral tasks. It is thus vital in this model to have the right people on the ground: for Ecknauer it should definitely be a case of “people driving numbers, not numbers driving people”.</p>
<p>In practice, KPIs and internal and external benchmarking are often used but should be broad enough to include soft factors and behaviour targets that demonstrate where additional value is created by treasury far beyond the simple executional model. For ABB, by measuring and equating diverse multiple factors against its many different locations, it is possible to understand the relative weighted value of even the smallest outposts and the same applies to the comparison of external partners. “It allows us to compare apples with pears,” explains Ecknauer.</p>
<p>To set a good benchmark, keeping treasury ears and eyes open for the ever-changing regulatory environment, business conditions and evolution of technology is essential. For Kenneth Ng, Director &amp; Corporate Treasurer for luxury travel retailer, DFS, and his team, it is also important to learn how treasury peers address business issues. This does not need to be a complex process: in addition to obtaining a quote from at least three different banks for forex trades, it also benchmarks the market average to ensure that the prices quoted are close to the market price. “DFS is constantly audited by internal partners and we need to prove we have the tools and capabilities to get the best deal in the market. That is our main KPI.” By using these tools it saves costs and time as well as complying with audit requirements. Having perfected the process for funding and investments, DFS’ treasury is now able to access information on peer deals across syndicated loans and corporate debt markets. As Ng comments: “We have a view on where the market is going and an understanding on how we can position ourselves to better negotiate long-term funding with our dealer banks.”</p>
<p>Of course, uprooting established processes for the sake of it will win few friends and may even, at the hands of resultant instability inherent in any major change, present increased risk. However, with a solid business case, a best-in-class project will demonstrate the capacity to “enable and facilitate” as Ecknauer puts it.</p>
<h3 id=""making-it-count"">Making it count</h3>
<p>Regardless of the origin of change, the bottom line focus for any business is on the money – “for the shareholders to make profits but also for the employees to make their living”. For Ecknauer, a best-in-class treasury must be one which “always contributes to the value chain of the core business”. For it to be “recognised and embedded as an advisor” not just at a transactional level but also amongst senior management, it must be ready, willing and able to counsel their strategic views and decisions in areas such as M&amp;A, geographic expansion, changes in business portfolio and regulatory matters.</p>
<p>However, although closer involvement across the business brings increased credibility to treasury, this is not about paying lip service to the notion of added-value, but must instead be an active and ongoing process. To this end, Ecknauer ponders just how many treasurers are willingly involved at the sharp end of industry and understand how their end-products are manufactured, or how many sit down with their salespeople to understand their issues and competitive disadvantages where, for example, competitors are offering financing.</p>
<p>Risks differ from company to company but where in the past senior management may have been content with believing ‘no news is good news’, as far as treasury was concerned, this evidently is not the case today. It matters how deep treasury’s involvement is in the rest of the business and it is important to understand that treasury cannot just be seen as a cost efficient operation when it comes to achieving best-in-class status: it also needs to demonstrate levels of performance beyond numerical studies of headcount or transactional costs, for example.</p>
<h3 id=""a-considered-approach"">A considered approach</h3>
<p>Where the move to best-in-class suggests a significant change for the organisation of treasury, and its banking processes and relationships, its systems and infrastructure or workflows and processes (or any combination thereof), it behoves treasury to put in place a formal system to manage the process. Of key importance to the process of building best-in-class is to formally analyse, understand and to map what needs to be achieved and why, before making decisions on technologies, partnerships and people.</p>
<p>Of course, in an ideal world, any shift to best-in-class would be sanctioned without reference to the price tag. But effectively balancing the needs of operational treasury with those of cost control is essential and it is not always an obvious choice where to cut and where to spend.</p>
<p>In a small in-country treasury unit, a limited number of personnel is often expected to fulfil multiple roles. Whilst this may satisfy a general business need for cost savings, this approach can create internal operational risk where critical staffing situations can quickly be reached (if annual leave clashes with sick leave, for example). Delaying investment in technology will also save costs but may also see skilled staff wasting time carrying out basic ‘number crunching’ tasks just to provide standard reporting. Automation may attract a cost but it will prevent such inefficiencies, allowing personnel to focus on “intangible value-added activities”. But, as Ecknauer points out, this will only be possible if there has also been a notable emphasis (and expenditure) on quality and training on the ground (wherever treasury is present), developing the skills and knowledge to provide robust and intelligent cross-functional support across the organisation.</p>
<p>Bergmann too adds a dash of relativism with any comparative approach he uses. When negotiating the terms and conditions of NSI’s new corporate facility, it took to benchmarking against comparable real estate companies. But many of these businesses have been listed for far longer, have a more international outlook, better ratings and so on. When this is understood, he says the discussion about differences ceases and benchmarking becomes a matter of “keeping aligned with the trends and being able to admit when matters are not on track”. In this way, he feels that the business not only knows where it stands today in terms of best practice, but also can realistically manage the outcome of its strategy relative to its competitors.</p>
<p>One company which has used best practice to its advantage when reshaping its treasury function is American multinational General Motors (GM). Having been through a project to implement an ambitious treasury transformation project across Asia (part of a global initiative to optimise treasury operations), there is still more to come as it continues to respond to the changing environment.</p>
<p>Before embarking on the initial project, GM was using several local banks for payments and cash management services in different countries across Asia. Core treasury activities were carried out by in-country treasury teams and without a TMS in place, processes were largely manual, resulting in inconsistent accounting and treasury processes from country-to-country. The goal of the project was to improve GM’s treasury operations by automating and streamlining processes. “The first step that we took was selecting our regional partner banks,” says Niyant Shah, Manager, International Operations at GM. “We invited some of our global partner banks to participate, and then selected two banks following a comprehensive evaluation process focusing on a variety of different criteria including technical and SWIFT capabilities, in-country capabilities, pricing structure and geographical coverage.”</p>
<p>Having selected the two banks, the next stage was to switch payments and receivables activities from existing local banks to the two regional partner banks. GM also standardised bank account structures across the region which included a concentration level account used to carry out treasury activities, the use of dedicated operating accounts for activities such as payables, receivables and tax and also a two-way zero balancing structure was put in place to move funds between the operating accounts and the concentration account. “It is crucial that we do not disrupt daily operations when we transition bank activities,” says Ying Cao, Manager of International Operations at GM. “In order to achieve this, we adopted a staggered approach to transition only one type of activity at one time and a new service only went live with the regional bank partner after successful test and pilot runs.” A single TMS deployed across the region will act as a single source for the company’s global debt position, letters of credit, fixed income, FX and commodities transactions, the platform also being used to execute core treasury activities such as investments and FX trades.</p>
<h3 id=""taking-action"">Taking action</h3>
<p>When a rapidly worsening economic climate was threatening to destabilise the Dutch real estate market Bergmann took this as his cue to instigate a change to a best practice financing model. In order to avoid the worst of the coming storm, the company had set about developing a new corporate strategy. “I made a point of inviting myself to the discussion table just so that from a treasury perspective I could understand where we wanted to go to and why,” he explains. With necessity very much the mother of invention, Bergmann concluded that treasury strategy “should as close as possible be linked to corporate strategy”. The ideas and information that flowed from these meetings offered treasury invaluable input to the new strategy created in their wake.</p>
<p>In another demonstration of financing best practice, engineering firm, Larsen &amp; Toubro in India initiated an internal discussion on how significant cost savings might be achieved by replacing high-cost bank debt with bonds and commercial paper. “Financing a power generation company in India was a difficult proposition when the company was being formed around five years ago,” explains Vipul Chandra, the firm’s Head of Treasury. “The debt required was about $1.2bn. There was thus a large banking consortium, comprising 23 banks, the management of which was onerous and also the debt was at relatively high cost.”</p>
<p>The corporate finance team went to work on a plan to replace bank debt with bonds and commercial paper. The debt issue achieved pricing efficiency by breaking up the size into multiple tranches, and closing each on a bilateral basis with multiple market participants, including Indian banks, Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) and mutual funds. The valuation methodology used for the call option exercise was an innovation in the Indian capital markets. By structuring the bank loan prepayment on specific dates, the team was able to completely avoid the prepayment charge. “Under the solution, the entire banking consortium was replaced with a few deals in the capital markets space, thus improving process efficiency and resulting in productivity gains for the finance team,” says Chandra. Thinking ahead and using innovative solutions resulted in the reduction of interest rates by 3.5% on the entire $1.2bn debt. The team’s message is clear: keep reviewing the portfolio for potential improvements, and understand that innovative solutions can and should be tried out for meeting business requirements and must not be discarded just because they haven’t been previously tried out in the market.</p>
<h3 id=""the-triumph-of-treasury"">The triumph of treasury</h3>
<p>Success with building a best-in-class treasury may be defined when “everyone is happy with what they have for the cost paid”, comments Ecknauer. “But as humans we will never be satisfied and happy enough with what we have,” he continues. This is where the role of benchmarking and KPIs comes into play but Ecknauer also urges a practical response, stressing the importance of not missing the boat on technology investments and also of asking the right questions, from top down and bottom up, “so there is the understanding of expectations in both directions”. Indeed, he adds for good measure that to become a best-in-class treasurer it should never be forgotten that whilst it is not possible to make all of the people happy all of the time and that the true professional is driven to constantly seek improvements, business is all about people and that treasury “cannot be seen as playing an isolated, execution-only role”.</p>


<blockquote>I made a point of inviting myself to the discussion table just so that from a treasury perspective I could understand where we wanted to go to and why.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">Ingmar Bergmann, Corporate Treasurer &amp; Head of Corporate Finance, NSI</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Indeed, teamwork has played a crucial role in the success of the treasury revamp at GM. There has been considerable cross-functional and cross-geographical involvement right across the group, with Shah’s international operations team working closely with the corporate team in the US as well as with the local teams, in-country. “From a core functional perspective, the treasury team was driving this – but there was also involvement from accounting, IT, legal and other functions. At the same time, we were working very closely with our regional banking partners to make sure that we were all aligned.”</p>
<p>The key to success for Bergmann lies in closely linking treasury strategy with corporate strategy. But he encourages treasurers to keep up with developments and understand where adjustments or refinements may be needed. For this to be effective, he urges senior treasury personnel to “make sure that you invite yourself to strategy meetings because normally treasurers are not invited”.</p>
<p>Indeed, proactivity is vital when seeking best-in-class. For treasurers who are often required to work with heads of other functions, Bergmann states that is essential to ensure you are not just waiting for them to contact you. “I call it management by walking around. It could be seen as a lazy approach but it always generates information you can use in your own work – and it always gives rise to discussions that can lead to new ideas.” In pursuit of a best-in-class treasury, “don’t be afraid to walk the floor!”</p>

<p><strong>Adam Smith Awards Winner – Top Treasury Team 2015</strong></p>
<p>HCA embarked upon a multi-year strategic plan which mapped out a new organisational structure spanning eight domains of expertise ranging from treasury operations and cash management to investor relations, exposure and risk management – a truly remarkable journey of transformation.</p>
<p>Hyundai Capital America (HCA) is a top ten auto lender. While initially HCA relied on low-cost asset backed securities (ABS) and attractive bank lending facilities to fund the lion’s share of its funding needs, asset growth propelled HCA’s balance sheet from $5bn in 2009 to close to $20bn by the end of 2012. Eric Senay and Frank Boroch share the key elements of HCA Treasury’s work including diversification of funding channels to support business expansion, deepening of liquidity sources to soundly manage the inherent volatility in the business, de-risking of the balance sheet through sophisticated liability management, reduction of interest expenses through improved financial community management and optimisation of funding instruments, and enhancement of flexibility for the business to finance incremental asset classes.</p>
<p>This webinar is held on Wednesday 13th April 2016.</p>

<h4 id=""questions-asked"">Additional questions answered by Bharti Airtel since the webinar:</h4>
<h5 class=""question"">What percentage of your total debt has a natural hedge and what percentage of the remaining debt do you hedge?</h5>
<p>We are currently in a continuing  exercise of deleveraging as well as re-adjusting the currency mix of our debt such that we have a larger proportion of debt in currencies of our operations, thus offering us a larger proportion of natural hedge on our debt. Also, some of the countries where we have operations in Francophone Africa wherein the local currency is pegged to euros and in DRC where USD is the functional currency of the country, we are able to get a natural hedge from the same.</p>
<p>Moreover, Bharti Airtel has a board approved policy towards hedging its outstanding FX liabilities, and in addition to the same, the company also looks to build additional buffers to protect against steep currency depreciation. At any point of time, our outstanding exposures are at least 50% hedged.</p>
<h5 class=""question"">What are the main challenges you see for your treasury specifically in the retained Africa business over the next 2-3 years? On the second one, I know you mentioned funding but you may wish to elaborate on this and other issues.</h5>
<p>Airtel Africa has been a tremendous learning experience for us as a company, and especially for us as a treasury. As a business, we continue to see Airtel as an opportunity with good indicators to create growth.</p>
<p>From the time of the acquisition of the  African business in 2010, we have been able to build a strong treasury product architecture with on ground treasury managers in each operating country, benign long term facilities for our operating countries, ability to hedge currencies across exotic currencies in Africa and a simplified transaction banking architecture. At present, as treasury, some of the key challenges that we continue to see is the volatility in liquidity and rates of currencies in a couple of countries especially in the wake of the commodity sell off, however, such dynamism is something we have seen in the past as well and are well placed to efficaciously manage. We continue to seek ‘stretch solutions’ from our banks, both to manage price risk and liquidity risks of US dollar or foreign currency – eg reciprocal deposits, forex swap, index/basket hedges and prop positions on options.</p>

<p><em>Often cheaper and faster than using external banking infrastructures, in-house banks can revolutionise a company’s cash flows and significantly reduce the expensive time cash spends stuck in the banking system. But given that corporates must streamline their payment processes and increase the visibility and control over cash flows first, Treasury Today explores the role of a treasurer in implementing the structure.</em></p>
<p>Predominantly established by medium-sized businesses upwards, an in-house bank (IHB) acts as the main provider of bank services, which are traditionally provided by commercial banks, to all group subsidiaries – on a regional or global scale. Rather than relying on local external banking partners, therefore, each subsidiary directs its cash flows through accounts held at the IHB. The internal bank is then responsible for netting out the resultant debit and credit balances across the whole group. This structure can result in huge savings of both time and money, as well as boasting limited disadvantages (<a href=""#table-1"">see Table 1</a>), so what do treasurers need to know?</p>
<p>Firstly, it must be noted that IHBs should not be seen as the first port of call when trying to streamline cash flows and payment processes. There are several other elements that are needed in conjunction: efficient external payment processes, shutting down bank-specific payment tools and electronic payment stations, making sure you have straight through processing established and cleaning master data and bank account management, for instance.</p>
<p>The reoccurring advice is to start with the standardisation and automation of payment processes and then establish an in-house bank to achieve the added value from this. For instance: a consolidation of FX transactions and a greater ability to recycle cash within currencies.</p>

<h3 id=""communicating-benefits"">Communicating benefits</h3>
<p>The implementation of an in-house bank should be seen as a transformation project, and its design is not to be planned in isolation but in partnership with the overall business. The structure’s benefits need to be articulated to the key stakeholders. Treasury should demonstrate to all areas of the business how an IHB can add value. Since treasury teams are under increasing pressure to drive down internal operational costs and to increase visibility and control, the argument for IHBs is persuasive.</p>
<p>What’s more, core banking partners should be brought into the early stages of development to provide the banking infrastructure and consultancy expertise necessary. This is because when all of the internal transactions have been carried out by the IHB, any remaining investment, financing and hedging needs will be fulfilled by the company’s preferred group of external, relationship banks. IHBs should be seen as complementary to existing bank landscapes.</p>
<p>It would be wrong to assume that traditional banking relationships suffer – the set-up may actually deepen them. IHBs are often run with the support of just one of two banks, to carry out final stage transactions, so they are likely to handle more flows than previously. This isn’t to say, however, that IHB structures necessarily suit every company. The benefits of IHBs are dependent on the presence of several factors, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The number of countries (and different currencies) involved with the company’s outgoing payments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FX volume and extent of hedging activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of transactions – internal and external – treasury is responsible for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Total amount of bank fees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Group structure and geographical distribution of operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How centralised treasury management is, including the IT structure (ERP systems, interfaces and electronic banking systems, for instance).</p>
</li>
</ul>




<h3 id=""some-global-considerations"">Some global considerations</h3>
<p>By extending the IHB structure into payables and receivables, regulatory hurdles in some regions are encountered. This meant, for some time at least, corporates had favoured a more traditional set-up – in Asia, Latin America and Africa for example. But recently, the popularity of IHBs in Asia has been on the rise; expansion has been occurring rapidly in some of the less restricted markets such as Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia. In these markets, the IHB processes payments and collections through its own accounts but where the use of local currencies for cross-border transactions is restricted, an account held in the name of a local entity can be used. Even in extreme cases where the IHB can only operate as a processing agent – utilising local accounts held by subsidiaries, rather than accounts held with the IHB, to process payments and collections – benefits of standardisation and greater control can still be felt.</p>
<p>Careful due diligence, in terms of the legal, tax, accounting and technology issues, is required for each market in order to address whether any level of local customisation of the IHB structure is necessary. Often, specific in-country requirements will drive an IHB’s operations.</p>
<p>These considerations also relate to other regions like Latin America and Africa, both of which are very diverse with regulations varying from country to country. Significant constraints exist in what form payments-on-behalf-of (POBO) and collections-on-behalf-of (COBO) can take. Therefore, a one-size-fits-all policy cannot be applied and there is a need to be flexible. Treasurers can lean upon banking partners, tax advisors and legal advisors to ensure the correct understanding of whether an IHB structure can be implemented and if so, to ensure that this is done correctly.</p>
<h3 id=""some-considerations-in-asia"">Some considerations in Asia</h3>
<p>The regulatory hurdles in Asia meant, for some time at least, corporates in the region favoured a more traditional set-up. But recently, the popularity of IHBs in Asia has been on the rise; expansion has been occurring rapidly in some of the less restricted markets such as Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia. In these markets, the IHB processes payments and collections through its own accounts but where the use of local currencies for cross-border transactions is restricted, an account held in the name of a local entity can be used.</p>
<p>Even in extreme cases where the IHB can only operate as a processing agent – utilising local accounts held by subsidiaries, rather than accounts held with the IHB, to process payments and collections – benefits of standardisation and greater control can still be felt. Careful due diligence, in terms of the legal, tax, accounting and technology issues, is required for each market in order to address whether any level of local customisation of the IHB structure is necessary. Often, specific in-country requirements will drive an IHB’s operations in Asia. In South Korea, for instance, strict data privacy rules will restrict any IHB holding company data offshore.</p>



<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h3 id=""location-location-location"">Location, location, location</h3>
<p>In order to provide the most value to the business, the location of the IHB needs to be considered too. This selection process will involve wider elements of an individual company’s operating model, such as: current business operational locations, whether certain countries have specific requirements, associated tax and regulation issues and the company’s articles of association. For those countries with nuances, it is advised that control is centrally maintained, even if the country’s bespoke model sits outside the main IHB structure. For instance, the IHB executes the transactions in the name of the local subsidiaries.</p>
<p>To avoid centralisation and standardisation being compromised by country-specific concerns – local payment instruments, technology capabilities and banking infrastructure maturity, for instance – explicitly entails a large amount of research prior to implementation of a full service IHB available to all subsidiaries of a group. Including exceptions and nuances in the overall design will ensure treasury’s key priorities, compliance and operational risk for instance, are not undermined.</p>
<p>However, the end visibility this affords is important to the success of an IHB. By having more control over all payment traffic, treasury can provide strategic information to the board – in turn, allowing them to make informed decisions. Any organisation considering rolling out an IHB structure should evaluate the costs, of course. But other factors to address before implementation include: educating the workforce, deciding upon new workflows and who will carry out what. Clear segregation of duties is needed when operating an IHB. There are various banking functions, such as bank account services, financing and hedging services and payment services, which can be brought in-house but it might not be in every case worthwhile to implement all.</p>
<p>Any changing of processes need to be well articulated to local teams. Starting with the benefits may ease some of the potential frustration as a result of losing control. For instance, from the local entities perspective, the IHB bank account will function like any other bank account. Employees can settle payments and receipts, as well as monitor such activities. Additionally, IHBs are closely linked to the company’s ERP system and treasury systems; subsidiaries can export statements to integrate with AR/AP and accounting systems.</p>
<h3 id=""internalising-banking-services"">Internalising banking services</h3>
<p>The centralisation of treasury operations has been an increasingly valuable proposition for some time now, but one which recent technological advancements and regional harmonisation are allowing to gather momentum. Although an IHB structure can also be used to enhance operations whilst keeping a decentralised structure, one of the major drivers for establishing one is the centralisation of liquidity.</p>
<p>Working capital optimisation, bank fee reduction and returns on idle cash are some of the many benefits corporates can expect from an IHB, which, in the current climate, would be well received. However, it is that same climate where the greatest threats to IHB structures originate – currency restrictions, political sanctions and regulation are the key things to bear in mind in 2016.</p>


<h2 class=""h3 copy__heading"">Case study</h2>
<p><img alt=""Firmenich SA"" class=""logo"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/logo/firmenich-logo-2010-100x27.png?la=en&amp;hash=FEEEF1B05437881D4D8502D139C7A27E"" width=""100""/></p>
<p class=""management-summary""><em>Founded in 1895, Firmenich SA is a private Swiss company in the perfume and flavour business. Employing 6,000 people globally, Firmenich is the largest privately owned company in the industry and ranks number two worldwide.</em></p>
<h3 id=""the-challenge"">The challenge</h3>
<p>As part of a global financial transformation project – to ensure that it had the necessary structure and governance to operate with rigour and discipline moving forward – Firmenich was looking to replace its traditional decentralised cash management solution with a global solution.</p>
<p>One of the company’s requirements was to reduce the number of external banks used by the affiliates to one core bank while offering, at the same time, the possibility to opening internal bank accounts with the in-house bank (IHB). Firmenich also wanted to deliver uniform payment and security processes, to ensure compliance with its risk management and internal control standards and to deliver true automation.</p>
<h3 id=""the-solution"">The solution</h3>
<p>After putting the mandate out to tender, Firmenich selected BNP Paribas for Europe, Citi for the rest of the world with the exception of the CHF covered by UBS to be their partners for the new solution. Working together with the banks Firmenich implemented a global cash management solution covering all 28 affiliates allowing them to join its global cash pooling solution as well as its inter-company netting process. This was completed by the implementation of a payment-on-behalf-of (POBO) structure serving more than 20 affiliates.</p>
<p>In less than two years, Firmenich has set up a global IHB. This was made possible by the existence of a single SAP instance (ECC6 version) implemented earlier to which two new SAP modules (IHC and BCM) were added to run the IHB. Today, the IHB is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Heading a global cash pooling structure (26 affiliates zero balanced on a daily basis on master accounts held in Switzerland and UK), offering full control on the cash around the globe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Running an internal netting (ICO) process to settle the payables and receivables of 25 affiliates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paying on behalf of 22 affiliates using only three banks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing a complete change in the payments process of the company, transforming inter-company payments into internal settlements with no cash transfer and cross-border payments into domestic payments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Key benefits include: reduced reliance on bank credit lines, reduction in bank charges, productivity gains (on average, 800 intra-group invoices are processed on a weekly basis without any rejection) and a daily view on more than 95% of the total cash of the group, out of which more than 75% is captured by the cash pooling structure.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>What will be the dominant issues on the treasury agenda in the year ahead? Will it be another big year for treasury transformation projects or will some treasurers have their hands too full managing market volatility and regulatory change? We ask a selection of industry experts to run through what they believe will be the big talking points of 2016 as we head into the new year.</em></p>
<p>The corporate treasury community are likely to see some big emerging opportunities in the year ahead, but treasurers will need to be on guard in case the economic weather begins to turn.</p>
<p>Treasury experts drawing up their predictions for 2016 largely agree on some broad themes – regulatory pressures will again loom large, mounting market volatility will test risk managers and new developments in infrastructure and treasury software will open the door to ever greater efficiencies.</p>
<p>These are not specifically new developments, but some commentators believe the driving forces behind them are now intensifying. Jacques Levet, Head of Transaction Banking for EMEA at BNP Paribas succinctly sums up the sentiment of his peers: “There is increasing pressure on the treasurers around the performance of their organisation; we are talking operational excellence, risk mitigation, and cost reduction.”</p>
<p>How well positioned are corporate treasurers to realise these goals? Precisely what impact will the increasingly gloomy global economic outlook have on developments? Answering these follow up questions in depth becomes, as we will see, a lot trickier.</p>
<h3 id=""a-bumpy-ride-ahead"">A bumpy ride ahead</h3>
<p>In the past year, foreign exchange (FX) markets have been affected by three issues above all else: the European Central Bank’s turn to accommodative monetary policies, China’s determination to allow market forces to play a greater role in setting the value of the renminbi, and expectations of an imminent interest rate rise in the US.</p>
<p>Experts believe these issues are likely to remain the principle FX drivers in 2016; but, we should not rule out more unexpected occurrences, the likes of which we have seen wreak havoc on markets in the past year. The shock of the Swiss franc being depegged and, to a lesser extent, the collapse of the Russian ruble, are but two examples of recent currency events that have jolted markets and put profitability pressures on some companies. For treasurers, the sensible thing to do is to work on the assumption that there will be more of the same this year, and adjust their risk mitigation strategies accordingly.</p>
<p>“What we have learned in the past year is that it is becoming ever more difficult to anticipate what will happen in the market,” says Philippe Gelis, CEO of Kantox, the London-based P2P foreign exchange providers for businesses. Decisions around what to hedge and how aggressively will ultimately come down to the particulars – profit margins and exposures – of each particular company. But in such volatile conditions some treasurers will undoubtedly see the need to become more active in their hedging. “What this means is that it is more important than ever to forecast your cash flows across all your foreign currencies and start hedging as soon as possible. The situation is becoming so complicated now that nobody can say what will happen next.”</p>


<blockquote>What we have learned in the past year is that it is becoming ever more difficult to anticipate what will happen in the market.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">Philippe Gelis, CEO, Kantox</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Despite all the uncertainty, Gelis identifies two specific trends for corporate treasurers to watch closely. Regarding EUR/USD, which is set to be impacted by long-awaited monetary policy divergence, he says, “some people are already speaking about parity – I don’t know if that will happen, given that these are the two most traded currencies globally, so that pair is a big concern for our clients.”</p>
<p>His other main area of concern relates to the currencies of the five major emerging market countries that have colloquially become known as the BRICS. “Brazil will pose a big challenge as the economy now is in a really bad shape,” he says. “The Brazilian real is a currency traded increasingly by corporates and it has become very volatile. And we are seeing the same happening in South Africa and Russia.”</p>
<h3 id=""when-basel-bites"">When Basel bites</h3>
<p>Treasurers are already feeling the impact of Basel III on their banking relationships. Pressures stemming from the measures have created a squeeze on bank financing (which is particularly acute for SMEs) and to some banks reconsidering their cash management business in certain geographies. But it is the growing conflict over cash Basel has precipitated that is perhaps the biggest, most universally felt impact in the treasury community. In 2016, this is likely to continue to weigh heavily on the corporate sector’s relationships with banking partners.</p>
<p>Many corporates have amassed large stockpiles of cash over recent years, at the same time as banks have become more selective around the types of deposits they accept. “In the past, if a client gave you a large deposit, you would be very happy,” says Ruth Wandhöfer, Global Head of Regulatory and Market Policy at Citi Treasury and Trade Services. The bank would then lend more and the balance sheet would grow. “But now we are in a situation where balance sheets are capped.”</p>
<p>Elaborating on the point, Wandhöfer explains that the introduction of the Basel Committee’s Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) at the beginning of 2015 means that, to please the regulators, banks have to find more assets to balance the liabilities on their balance sheet without “overshooting the generic target.” Ultimately, this means the banks must optimise the liabilities they have by encouraging clients to pay in more of the operational deposits deemed ‘sticky’ by the regulators, as opposed to surpluses that are not required for daily activities.</p>
<p>The efforts banks are making to ward off the regulatory threat posed to them by the latter type of deposits are already becoming evident. In the past year, several Wall Street banks are said to have been focusing on cutting unwanted deposits partly through changes to fees. Conscientious treasurers will accordingly need to spend more time in touch with their banks in the year ahead if they are to be sure of finding a home for their company’s cash. “There is a need now for tighter communication and collaboration between corporates and banks,” Wandhöfer says. “Corporates will need to be more transparent going forward regarding their moves and how they expect to deploy liquidity, and we may even see something like a penalty charge being imposed should a client unexpectedly deposit a significantly large non-structural liquidity deposit.”</p>
<h3 id=""rates-and-regulation"">Rates and regulation</h3>
<p>The banks’ main competitors for corporate liquidity, the money market fund (MMF) industry, is facing their own regulatory pressures, the final form of which remain, in Europe at least, uncertain. Indeed the industry spent much of 2015 waiting for action from the European regulatory authorities. Although a proposal was put forward by the European Commission (EC) at the beginning of the year, which was finally approved by the European Parliament (EP) in April 2015, the final stage of the legislative process – the Trilogue negotiation between the EC, EP and Council of Ministers – is still to commence.</p>
<p>Treasurers will therefore be keeping a close watch on developments in Brussels in the coming months, particularly to see whether the coming regulatory shake-up occasions the prohibition of Constant Net Asset Value (CNAV) MMFs, the accounting treatment around which many investors favour, and the emergence of new types of product such as the Low Volatility Net Asset Value (LVNAV) MMFs that were mooted in the EC’s final proposal.</p>
<p>The other tectonic force affecting the MMF industry at the moment is the rate environment. Accommodative monetary policies pursued by the European Central Bank (ECB) have pushed down yields on the short-term debt instruments that MMFs purchase, making it increasingly difficult for fund managers to generate positive returns for their investors. With no directional change in policy at the ECB appearing to be on the cards in the near future, credit ratings agency Fitch says, in its 2016 MMF Outlook, that it expects yields on euro-denominated MMFs to remain in negative territory in 2016 (in contrast to its outlook for sterling and dollar MMFs, which it says may see “their yields picking up timidly” in the coming months).</p>
<p>The risk of large redemptions by corporate treasurers unwilling to stomach ‘paying’ a fund to hold their assets would appear to be minimal though. Indicative perhaps of the dearth of good short-term investment alternatives out there at the moment, outflows to MMFs not only stopped in 3Q2015, they actually began to reverse despite the average euro MMF gross yield remaining at a negative 0.06%.</p>
<p>“I think that shows that corporate treasurers are, however reluctantly, now accepting negative yields on euro MMFs,” says Alastair Sewell, Senior Director at Fitch Ratings’ Fund and Asset Manager Rating Group. “We think that is a very material development.”</p>
<p>There are two implications stemming from this trend. Firstly, some investment policies may have to change (readers will find an in-depth analysis of this issue on page 33). “We would expect to see treasurers adjusting guidelines in a prudent way,” says Sewell, explaining that certain policy constraints could mean treasurers are missing out on a potentially useful segment of the market. “Historically, you see legacy practices baked into investment guidelines which can limit the choice or flexibility that corporate treasurers have. So as a first step we expect and we understand corporate treasurers are reviewing some of those legacy points in their guidelines.”</p>
<p>Secondly, corporate treasurers are already becoming more active in their forecasting and segmenting their cash. As a consequence of this, Fitch expects to see the European market for short-term investment products for treasurers grow significantly. “We are certainly aware of various fund providers having approached us with ideas for new funds targeting yield hungry corporate treasurers, who wish to generate a little bit of incremental return but at the expense of selectively taking more risk.”</p>
<h3 id=""new-year-new-treasury"">New year, new treasury</h3>
<p>Should the predictions of our industry experts come to pass, there will be no shortage of challenges for treasurers to get their teeth stuck into over the course of the next 12 months. The more forward-looking, precocious members of the profession will, however, no doubt already be thinking about how these same challenges can be reconceived and turned into opportunities.</p>
<p>This is the mind-set that separates those that simply survive and those that truly thrive. Take the recent bout of FX volatility. Reactive treasurers might stop at making some minor alterations to their hedging strategies, perhaps taking out less forward contracts and switching to options for certain currencies. Meanwhile, treasurers with a more proactive mentality might decide to return to the fundamentals of cash forecasting, and explore ways to improve the visibility of cash positions across various geographical structural dimensions. A similar approach could be applied to short-term investments. If regulation and the yield environment is making it a struggle to use bank deposits and MMFs, perhaps it is time to explore what other instruments – tri-party repos or segregated mandates, for instance – might be used instead.</p>
<p>Once such exercises have been concluded, the treasurer may well find that in addition to solving the immediate problem, the changes made lead to a more effectual, resilient treasury over the long term. New tools might be needed to help treasurers to do that though. While it would be wrong, indeed dangerous, to suggest that technology alone is the answer to all the challenges the treasurer faces, new innovations are now in development that have the potential power to radically transform treasury. We cannot say, with any certainty, whether this will happen over the next year, but it is clear that the industry buzz around certain experimental technologies is right now on the rise.</p>

<p>“In order to tackle these challenges, treasurers need help,” says BNP Paribas’ Levet. “They also need to find new ways of working – and the new technologies we see emerging will help them do just that.” Levet cites three categories of new technologies that he thinks banks and vendors need to look at to create what he calls “game changing solutions” for treasurers: big data, blockchain and artificial intelligence. He says: “I am convinced that, in all three of those families, breakthrough solutions are imminent. But at the same time, when discussing these new technologies we should not only highlight their truly disruptive potential, but also consider how they can, today, help banks significantly improve their existing processes and hence deliver dramatically enhanced services to their clients.”</p>
<p>On blockchain especially we have seen evidence this year that these are not just hollow words. Under the R3-led initiative, the Distributed Ledger Group (DLG), banks are pooling money and resources to explore how distributed ledger technologies like blockchain might be applied to a variety of purposes including the overhaul of the existing payments infrastructure, the settlement of securities and even some less obvious use-cases such as in the execution of certain compliance processes such as Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC).</p>
<p>Right now R3 says its priorities are determining what component of distributed ledger solutions should be open source, the launching of a ‘lab environment’ in which to test solutions, and the building of an architectural framework as development of the codebase begins. One thing is for certain: whatever solutions emerges from this project in 2016 and the coming years, a world of new exciting opportunities is now opening up for treasurers. And that should mean that irrespective of the stiff challenges they are facing, the coming year need not be anticipated with a sense of dread.</p>
<p>“They should be looking forward to it,” adds Levet. “The role of the treasurer has considerably evolved and it is now that of a strategic partner in the organisation. Treasurers will as well have the opportunity to co-develop solutions with banks and vendors around innovative technologies to improve the way they operate. The opportunities brought forward by this collaborative approach and those new technologies far outweigh their respective risks.”</p>

<p><em>Cash flow forecasting is crucial to managing the financial health of a company and as such, it has remained at the top of the corporate agenda for some time now. But it can be one of the most frustrating tasks, partly because of inaccurate and untimely reporting from different business units. Is a simple or sophisticated approach best? Can technology make the job easier? Treasury Today goes back to basics to answer these questions and more.</em></p>
<p>A large part of the treasurers’ remit involves ensuring liquidity is managed well, in addition to cash being used dynamically as an asset of a business. At the point of consumption, cash should be where it is needed and available in the currency required; if there is surplus cash, it should be used to either meet shortfalls elsewhere in the company or be invested to earn a good rate of return. “These requirements are best supported through a combination of defined processes which support policy, people with the required skills to implement these and products (technology solutions) which facilitate accurate and timely projections of cash flows within a company,” says Kevin Grant, Member of the Executive Board at Hanse Orga.</p>
<p>But cash flow forecasting is notoriously problematic: variability in the amounts, currencies and timing of cash flows, as well as the impact of those changes which are unpredictable (market prices for commodities and FX rates and interest rates, for instance). The intrinsic issues related to the business – its infrastructure, business model and geographical spread – are also of consideration.</p>
<p>It’s not difficult to see why the task throws up many problems but, given its importance, cash flow forecasting must be become a finely-tuned practice for the corporate treasury department. “If you don’t forecast, then you’re not in a position to really understand with any level of confidence what decisions the business needs to be making,” clarifies Bob Stark, VP Strategy at Kyriba, a leader in cloud-based TMSs. Corporates understand the importance of the process, however. “Cash flow forecasting is one of the highest initiatives on the corporate agenda and this has been the case for many years.”</p>
<h3 id=""the-process"">The process</h3>
<p>Treasurers are required, above all else, to know where their company’s funds are, and why they are there. After all, the assurance is needed that if some unfortunate – and unexpected – incident occurs, the cash supplies will not fall short. What’s more, forecasting is increasingly important in determining the investment strategy of a company. These factors entail active oversight. Cash flow forecasting, therefore, requires a myriad of different technology systems and applications, including accounting, treasury management systems (TMS), enterprise resource planning (ERP), spreadsheets and emails to (somehow) present a consistent and integrated view. Only then can the questions such as ‘how much cash does the company have?’ or ‘what is the cash flow over the past six months in a certain subsidiary or currency?’ be answered with any degree of certainty. But the data sources – including details of thousands of customers and potentially hundreds of bank accounts – are held in multiple places and systems. Consequently, the first step towards accurate forecasting is to establish a single source of the truth.</p>
<h3 id=""a-complete-picture"">A complete picture</h3>
<p>Gaining visibility of cash positions for all subsidiaries within a group was frequently mentioned as a challenge by respondents to a recent Treasury Today European Corporate Treasury Benchmarking Study. Some corporates noted improvements made through introducing short-term cash flow forecasting for pool participants, moving away from manual payments and replacing local online banking solutions with centralised collection of bank statements, for instance. And although technology plays a critical role in forecasting, some respondents to Treasury Today’s Benchmarking Study said that they were ‘trying to obtain the most value out of the data and technology that [they] already have’. Grant adds: “If a corporate is moving away from spreadsheets to use systems in an integrated way to pull cash information together from numerous sources – that, historically, has been quite complicated to achieve.”</p>
<h3 id=""the-products"">The products</h3>
<p>What solutions are available to corporates, to ease the strain, then? At Hanse Orga, for instance, a SAP-integrated cash flow forecasting solution is offered which takes into consideration a considerable amount of “master data” to generate relevant forecasts. “There may be underlying data in other modules of SAP which we bring together to give clients a consolidated picture of the company’s short to medium term cash requirements,” explains Grant. Hans-Gerd Riediger, Solutions Architect at Hanse Orga uses the example of accounting data: “We incorporate accounts receivables, accounts payable, payment data and payment behaviour – information that is typically used for accounting purposes – in the forecast.” Data from some sources external to SAP can also be imported.</p>
<p>According to Kyriba’s Stark, asides from systems allowing you to build a forecast, technology also affords you the benefit of “measuring the effectiveness or accuracy of that forecast”. Although Microsoft’s Excel application boasts simplicity and low costs, the software’s dependency on the human aspect of the data collection and input required leaves it open to error. The case against the use of spreadsheets in cash forecasting is bigger than that, though. “What treasurers find out pretty quickly with spreadsheets is that – never mind being a lot of work and having the potential for error – the mechanics of what they need to do are beyond Excel’s ability,” says Stark. Treasurers want to be able to monitor the accuracy of forecasts by comparing historic flows anticipated against the actual flows the business is experiencing. For this part, there is a reliability gained by using products that reconcile how accurate forecasting mechanisms are, compared to spreadsheets that don’t allow automated process monitoring to take place. Systems are most often connected via the internet allowing subsidiaries to enter data required for forecasting into one database which can be analysed centrally.</p>
<p>All of the leading treasury vendors offer cash flow forecasting within their treasury systems. SunGard, for instance, offers integrated cash flow forecasting with its CashPredictor integrated within its AvantGard product to provide real-time visibility on cash positions globally in a user-friendly manner accessible to all treasury staff. Likewise, Wall Street Systems incorporate a cash flow forecasting system into their Wall Street Suite which enables functionality between business entities, and allows subsidiaries to submit the forecast directly to the treasury on a timely basis.</p>
<p>Kyriba have web-based applications such as KyribaTi that are available through partnered financial institutions, and offer cash flow forecasting and other treasury management solutions over the internet too. “As opposed to Excel, you can use flexible data sources – from overseas for remote offices, from regional controllers or historical information, for instance – to ensure you are not constrained by your model,” says Stark. Treasurers can then understand how accurate their company’s forecasting processes are – and adapt accordingly. “A system offers all of these things: the automation as opposed to manually creating formulas and the ability for data analytics to measure the effectiveness of the forecast.”</p>
<p>What’s more, “technology vendors will hold discussions based on a company’s individual needs – including what the business life cycle is and what IT infrastructure is currently in place – in order to find the best solution” says Riediger. The resounding advice: to embrace technology and make it work for you. This means it must be calibrated for your organisation as there could be a lot of technological power that isn’t being used to its full potential. Other tips include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Integrate systems.</h5> <br/>
<p>The more operational systems you can integrate as sources, the better the forecast will be. This means the systems in place need to be able to ‘speak’ to each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Automate (as much as possible).</h5> <br/>
<p>The procurement of cash balances on a daily basis for all accounts, for instance, should be automated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Define the terminology.</h5> <br/>
<p>The difference between short-, medium- and long-term forecasts, their parameters and usage should be understood by all subsidiaries involved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Ensure processes are standardised.</h5> <br/>
<p>Employees must be able – and willing – to follow corporate policy. In order to capture the data needed for analysis, all subsidiaries must be following the same practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Maximise internal relationships.</h5> <br/>
<p>Efficient cash flow forecasting means working closely with planning and budgeting to ensure both profit and loss cash perspectives are generated. Maintaining good relationships within the business will help guarantee updated forecasts are reported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Request feedback.</h5> <br/>
<p>Going back to the subsidiaries to give, and receive, feedback will help fine-tune the process. This will give you an idea of how well subsidiaries have done – think about attaching a KPI measure to cash flow forecasting to incentivise improvement to information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Make people accountable.</h5> <br/>
<p>It is sometimes advised that, in order to avoid the task becoming a cut and paste job with inevitable errors, people should be held accountable for forecasting errors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""operating-in-a-cost-effective-manner"">Operating in a cost effective manner</h3>
<p>For those who need to make the key business decisions, having a solution that enables access to a complete picture of cash is one of foremost benefits. But the value of a forecast is beyond just saving the time and effort of going to multiple data points. “It’s about doing the forecast properly which yields the ability to make better decisions,” says Stark. For example, if a company has excess cash, being able to put that to better use and earn returns or, if in a borrowing situation, being able to borrow more effectively – getting better rates or looking at different sources of capital, perhaps. Hedging programmes can also be that bit more effective as treasurers are in a better place to protect and predict what the cash flows are going to be. As Stark says: “If you don’t have good opportunity to project what those cash flows in foreign currencies are going to be, then you’re subject to the roller-coaster of volatility.”</p>
<p>In addition to benefits felt across investing, borrowing and FX management, there is a case for a fourth benefit in terms of cash mobility, according to Stark. When companies have different pools of cash globally, treasurers will want to optimise the use of these pools. Improved cash flow forecasting and visibility makes sure cash can be mobilised and deployed in the areas of the organisation where it is needed, hence preventing pockets of cash remaining unleveraged.</p>


<blockquote>The resounding advice: to embrace technology and make it work for you. This means it must be calibrated for your organisation as there could be a lot of technological power that isn’t being used to its full potential.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source""></p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Further spinoffs of cash forecasting projects include understanding the (often complex) bank account structure within a company and the possibility of embracing supply chain finance solutions, comments Hanse Orga’s Grant. “eBam applications can offer significant improvements around the administration and bank fee analysis of the companies in-country bank accounts; any cash forecasting system must begin with bank account visibility. With improved cash forecasting you can start to consider the return you receive on surplus cash held at the account level, compared to improved returns available by actively using this cash. An example would be to consider shortening your DPO in return for a discount on the accounts payable invoice value which could be quite a compelling proposition in the world of ultra-low interest levels we see today.” As briefly explained above, if cash needs are not going to be met by the cash flow into the organisation, advance notice can also ensure treasurers borrow cash at a lower cost than may be required if they just look at short-term funding instruments.</p>
<h3 id=""overcoming-issues"">Overcoming issues</h3>
<p>The case for specialised software has certainly increased over recent years but regardless of the technology implemented, there are still some issues that need to be addressed when it comes to liquidity forecasts. One of the major factors that affects the accuracy of forecasts is the communication of inaccurate figures from departments and subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, however, the benefits of getting the process right are recognised by corporates. “Ten years ago, CFOs and treasurers would come to us and ask what we could do for them in terms of cash flow forecasting. Now, they know the answer and what they want to accomplish. They just want to make sure they have the best tools in front of them,” explains Stark. It isn’t a matter of education, but rather how to fine-tune the process which is so vital for cost effective business.</p>




<h3 id=""cash-forecasting-a-checklist"">Cash forecasting: a checklist</h3>
<p>In addition to making use of the technology on offer, the best way to improve cash forecasting, according to Treasury Alliance Group, is to evaluate the current process against four other best practices of cash forecasting.</p>
<h5>Simplicity.</h5>
<p>A cash forecast requires two pieces of accurate information: the amount of cash on hand and the amount to be received net of expenses. Add the dimensions of time and currency; when will the cash be received, and in what currency and you have a reasonable and very effective cash forecast.</p>
<h5>Cooperation.</h5>
<p>Good quality forecasting input is the primary determinant of a good quality forecast. And the quality of the input is in the hands of your business partners. Building trust is therefore an important step in this process.</p>
<h5>Communication.</h5>
<p>Forecasting in a global company adds the challenge of multiple currencies, language and culture. It is critical that all business units adopt common definitions in the cash forecasting process.</p>
<h5>Structure.</h5>
<p>Cash forecasting problems arise when business units lose faith in central treasury’s ability to respond to their urgent funding needs in a timely manner. They respond with excessive caution in forecasting receipts and even hold onto their own cash reserves, diluting the accuracy and value of the forecast. The solution is to have an efficient account structure serviced by a reliable network of banks.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>Underpinning the cold, administrative-like nomenclature of ISO 20022 concept is a common language that has the capacity to streamline and lower the costs of a number of corporate-to-bank messaging processes. Treasury Today looks at the story so far.</em></p>
<p>As a universal financial industry messaging scheme, ISO 20022 can be considered ‘state of the art’. Whereas EDIFACT, the UN-developed international electronic data interchange standard, tried to tackle the issue of message harmonisation and straight through processing, it has had limited success, largely because it has not been accepted as an international standard. ISO 20022 XML is different. With the push given by the mandated arrival of SEPA and the consequent embedding of its technical make-up into most ERP and treasury management systems, it has already achieved the kind of support necessary to help make it part of the everyday language of international treasury.</p>
<p>The standard was developed within the Technical Committee TC68 – Financial Services of ISO – of the International Organisation for Standardisation. The first edition, published in December 2004, proposed a standardised XML (extensible mark-up language) based syntax for messages. This would prove to be its saving grace. The inaugural communications for payments were approved in September 2005.</p>
<p>ISO 20022 (previously known as UNIFI) is by no means a static proposition and the changes keep coming to handle new needs like immediate payments (the ISO Real-Time Payments Group, made up of over 50 global experts, is tasked with driving forward the project of developing the ISO 20022 messages required). The breadth of ISO 20022 has also expanded from payments to cover areas including securities, trade, cards and foreign exchange.</p>
<p>Today, ISO 20022 is used both for market infrastructures and for corporate connectivity. Market infrastructures means bank-to-bank execution of payments via the central bank for most RTGS or a local central bank approved clearing house for most local low value payments. Corporate connectivity describes corporate-to-bank communications such as sending payment instructions to, and receiving statements from, a bank. Most central banks and clearing houses – in almost every major country around the globe – have increasingly bought into ISO 20022 as the best way to manage local clearing.</p>
<p>The XML part of the equation is the machine language counterpart to the more familiar HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) found in every web page: XML carries data whereas HTML defines how it should be displayed: XML is purely a software- and hardware-independent means of encoding, storing and transporting data. But whereas HTML has a way of wrapping up a message in predefined computer ‘tags’, XML tags have no such definition and need to be written in order to send, receive, store or display the wrapped content. ISO 20022 formally standardised those tags, creating a uniform messaging tool that could traverse the financial space; the implementation of SEPA could not have been achieved without it.</p>
<h3 id=""sepa-gives-rise"">SEPA gives rise</h3>
<p>When SEPA instruments were first introduced back in 2008 and 2009, the European Commission (EC) required a uniform messaging format to be used for payments across all the SEPA zone markets. The EC decided that SEPA credit transfer (SCT) and direct debit (SDD) schemes should use a subset of ISO 20022 messages. With the XML-based messaging format, it meant that for the first time in payment processing history, the entire end-to-end transaction flow could be executed using the same standard for payment initiation, clearing and reporting.</p>


<blockquote>If one corporate works with a specific bank and ERP system, and another corporate works with a different bank and ERP system, they can use the same XML format instead of going through a migration exercise and customising XML for each of these relationships.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source""></p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>It also now means that if one corporate works with a specific bank and ERP system, and another corporate works with a different bank and ERP system, they can use the same XML format instead of going through a migration exercise and customising XML for each of these relationships. For corporates, the increased homogenisation of payments around direct debit and credit transfers has become a real prospect for corporates in Europe, facilitated only by the across-the-board adoption of ISO 20022 XML payments standards.</p>
<p>Because of all the hype around SEPA, it may be easy to mistake ISO 20022 XML as a Europe-only set of message standards. But it was always intended to be used in every domain of the financial world. Indeed, ISO 20022 allows 65,536 characters which is enough to handle all known writing systems, hence its adoption by many ‘non-Roman’ language based market infrastructures. It is used, for example, for clearing in China (CNAPS2), Japan (Zengin and BoJNet) and Russia (CMPG).</p>
<p>ISO 20022 is as broad in its functional reach as it is in geographic spread. Whereas SWIFT’s FIN MT standards were designed only for cross-border high-value flows like FX settlement, ISO 20022 covers the likes of cheques, bank drafts, local low value (like payroll), bulk payments, cross-border and trade transactions. FIN was ‘patched’ to handle some of these needs, but saw each bank create its own workaround. This caused many difficulties for treasury interconnections, and major operational risks as market infrastructures around the world upgraded to offer new services like immediate payments. ISO 20022 offers standards for every conceivable message a corporate treasurer would want to send, and many more for other financial purposes (see <a href=""#table-1"">table</a> below).</p>

<h3 id=""keeping-ahead-of-the-game"">Keeping ahead of the game</h3>
<p>The flexibility of ISO 20022 means it is not actually necessary for corporates to use it to instruct their banks to make payments through ISO 20022 market infrastructures: traditional EDI formats such as ANSI X12 and UNI/EDIFACT, or even Excel, may be used. Corporates can also use ISO 20022 to instruct their bank to pay over legacy market infrastructures like ACH, FIN or even cheque – with standards available for how to execute each. The more market infrastructures move to ISO 20022, the more compelling it is for corporate connectivity and the more it will become the ‘de facto’ model.</p>
<p>However, there is a need for more than just new message-types in the corporate-to-bank space; there is a need to manage market practices, to avoid such workarounds and ensuing inefficiency. SWIFT has developed a number of tools to try to help corporates and banks work together. The key to co-operation is the CGI-MP (Common Global Implementation-market practice) Group. This is the new, more focused name for the old CGI, remaining the same group of industry stakeholders (mainly banks, corporates, market infrastructure providers and vendors) who have come together with the intention of creating a singular approach to SWIFT messaging standards, and now including all those under ISO 20022.</p>
<p>In practice, CGI-MP seeks to build a uniform layer on top of the basic message formats. It recommends how these messages should be best used in the corporate world. Banks can still develop their own specifications on top of CGI-MP as a third layer as they will have some competitive proprietary tools that require this approach but global adoption by market infrastructures and rapid standardisation of corporate connectivity by GCI-MP mean that ISO 20022 is effectively future-proof.</p>
<p>Whatever new payment technologies come along from now on, they will most likely be cleared using ISO 20022. And even if not, the global breath and coverage of CGI-MP should mean that corporate connectivity standards will be developed at the same time as any new payment systems are rolled out. This in turn ensures that treasurers using ISO 20022 are effectively hedging themselves against the operational risk and cost of future developments in payment technologies and services.</p>
<p>Moreover, being a global standard developed by corporates, banks and system vendors means that ISO 20022 is well-supported by corporate systems: indeed, almost all ERPs and TMSs have in-built ISO 20022 functionality. In effect, treasurers using ISO 20022 can lower their costs and operational risks by using established and well-known standards as opposed to implementing the likes of bank proprietary standards or Excel interfaces.</p>
<p>Despite the best efforts of CGI-MP there is a persistent myth that ISO 20022 is not globally standardised. In most cases, this stems from treasurers’ perception that ISO 20022 does not take away local requirements like withholding tax in Thailand, Boletos in Brazil or purpose codes for payments in Chinese RMB. What CGI-MP can and does do, is to standardise the way these local nuances should be coded in ISO 20022 messages, so that treasurers only need to figure it out once for it to work with all banks. Where treasurers may be dealing with countries that have not yet been standardised by CGI-MP, it may be time to step up and join CGI-MP.</p>
<h3 id=""other-use-cases"">Other use cases</h3>
<p>Although SEPA was the most visible – and influential – early adopter of the standard, ISO 20022 was intended to be used in every domain of the financial world. One of these is electronic Bank Account Management (eBAM). For many years now, corporate treasuries have been demanding technology that will allow them to automate the process of opening, closing and managing their many global bank accounts. It is easy to understand why. With a typical corporate working with on average 15-20 different banks, each likely to be governed by different local regulations, even making simple amendments to an account using traditional manual, paper-based methods can often become a very time-consuming process.</p>
<p>Collaborating with a select group of banks, solutions providers, and corporates, SWIFT established and piloted 15 standard eBAM ISO 20022 XML messages, each of which was designed to cope with a range of different business scenarios including account opening after KYC, account closing, signatory and mandate management and reporting.</p>
<p>After some corporates expressed frustration regarding omissions to the original standards, ISO proposed some changes and a new version of the eBAM standards was certified by the group in 2013. Unlike the initial versions, the new standards allow, for example, a group of signatories can be defined, as can electronic mandates. Together with another digital initiative to replace wet signatures, 3SKey, these latest XML messages would, in theory at least, now allow corporates to perform the majority of bank account management functions electronically.</p>
<p>Although corporate uptake of eBAM solutions to date remains minimal, as adoption of ISO 20022 gathers pace, so too may eBAM follow. If it does, the consolidated and accurate cross-border bank account information workflows it will establish will bring a host of different benefits to treasury teams, including greater automation, improved risk management and security and a much simplified compliance processes.</p>
<p>Another noteworthy innovation that could receive a huge boost from increased ISO 20022 uptake is e-invoicing. Efficient e-invoicing and processing has been on the corporate treasurer’s wish-list practically since the birth of the internet-age in the 1990s.</p>


<blockquote>Even if not mandated to migrate, like European companies were in the run-up to SEPA in February 2014, moving to these standard XML formats is something which treasurers today should seriously consider.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source""></p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Although adoption of such solutions allows companies to improve working capital and supply chain finance processes, uptake to date has been hampered by a combination of legal uncertainty and the absence of common standards. In Europe, for example, according to figures published by the European Commission just two years ago, e-invoicing accounted for between 4% to 15% of all invoices exchanged in the region. The lack of common standards is less of an issue now that the industry has defined an XML format for e-invoicing, based on exactly the same data elements as SEPA XML. Consequently, industry experts believe companies will make a big push towards implementing e-invoicing in the years ahead. This would represent a big step towards the ultimate goal of automation right across the corporate value-chain.</p>
<h3 id=""migrating-to-xml"">Migrating to XML</h3>
<p>The process to migrate to ISO 20022 XML typically begins with the treasurer first ensuring that both internal and external systems support XML formats. For those who are already using SWIFT or a modern electronic proprietary banking system this is not likely to be a problem, but any systems provided by smaller, local banks or running older versions will almost certainly need to be replaced or upgraded. In the case of internal systems, most ERP and TMS vendors modified their systems in the run-up to the SEPA deadline in order to support XML; for most international vendors this change would be applicable anywhere.</p>
<p>For treasurers not using fully up-to-date versions, the upgrade process can be complex, lengthy and expensive, particularly for companies that have multiple ERP systems in operation. This perhaps explains why third-party conversion services proved a popular way to ensure compliance ahead of the SEPA deadline.</p>
<p>For those that decide not to use a third party, there are a number of simple steps which can be taken to ensure that an ISO 20022 migration project is a smooth one:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Establish a centralised governance and management structure.</h5>
<p>One of the biggest challenges, given that every company has its own sets of competing priorities, is securing sufficient IT resources for the project. In such cases, setting up a centralised team can help facilitate buy-in from the top decision-makers within an organisation thereby ameliorating the issue somewhat. This central unit will also be crucial for developing and coordinating the process. This will include processes such as drawing up a detailed project plan and taking into account the necessary investments needed for the project, writing rulebooks, and creating an implementation guide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Secure a budget.</h5>
<p>Once the scope of the project is known, a central budget should be drawn up. Some treasurers whose departments completed ISO 20022 XML migration as part of their SEPA compliance projects are on record as saying a phased approach with commitments spread out over a long period is preferable to project funding that is monolithic in nature and sought from the outset. Another lesson from SEPA is that there was a tendency for companies to underestimate the cost of migration at the outset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Determine the timescale for implementation.</h5>
<p>A plan should be established that includes approximate timeframes for the migration. This should cover everything from writing technical specifications, making IT changes, testing, going live and decommissioning legacy systems. When doing this it is worth noting that resources of your banking partners may also be constrained and this might impact the turnaround times for the XML files they are producing, which may in turn impact your project timeline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Make use of validation portals.</h5>
<p>For a corporate, being able to test whether their use of XML is in line with the implementation guide before they go live is vital. Validation portals – such as SWIFT’s MyStandards Readiness Portal – are able to point out exactly where problems occur by highlighting the data field and provide a direct link to the section of the implementation guide or rulebook that explains how to fix it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving to XML is now widely considered to be best practice. Even if not mandated to migrate, like European companies were in the run-up to SEPA in February 2014, moving to these standard XML formats is something which treasurers today should seriously consider. The benefits of operating with this standard, in terms of the efficiency gains of end-to-end processing across the entire supply chain, cannot be ignored. As the harmonisation work on XML standards drives yet further adoption and promotion, the alternatives, such as EDI (which is still used in most bank systems because customers still use it), seem to be heading to the history books. ISO 20022 XML, looks like being the future of financial messaging.</p>

<h4>What are the major risks that corporate treasurers face today and how is this impacting their priorities?</h4>
<p>In recent months, both in Asia Pacific (APAC) and globally, there has been a significant amount of volatility in the market that has created numerous challenges for corporates. The stock market crash and macroeconomic slowdown globally have been well reported and brought to light uncertainties in the economy and heightened operational fears. There has also been the currency devaluation that has occurred across the region which has given corporates a different set of challenges to manage, as have the all-time lows and volatility that we have seen in the commodities market.</p>
<p>Heightened geopolitical risk in Asia is further adding to the list of concerns for corporates and the consequences of these transcend the region’s borders. Recent examples include the anxiety in the Korean Peninsula created by flashpoints between the North and South and political uncertainty in some of the region’s other markets, including Malaysia and Thailand. These events all raise questions for the corporate treasurer around what the potential impact might be to the onshore cash and assets that the business has and how to safeguard the same.</p>
<p>In market conditions such as these it is unsurprising that companies, which have enjoyed years of growth through expansion into new markets, have begun to refocus their attention on ‘sustainable’ growth. As a result of this change in focus, the role of the treasurer, the custodian for the company’s cash assets, has also changed in the face of these new market realities and become even more critical for the success of the organisation moving forward. Treasurers across the region are therefore now performing more strategic roles to help the organisation navigate through the plethora of risks that exist by leveraging new technology and ensuring that the treasury is nimble enough to respond to any future market events.</p>
<h4>How has the recent market volatility demanded both a new approach to, and new tools for, FX risk management?</h4>
<p>As a result of rising market volatility, we have seen many corporates proactively revisiting their policies to ensure that they have adequate room to manoeuvre when reacting to market events. This has given treasury the opportunity to step up and shield the business from currency movements where required – allowing business leaders to focus on their core objectives rather than FX.</p>
<p>With high volatility in the market, treasurers are increasingly recognising the need to leverage technology to allow their operation to be more resilient and agile so they can respond with pace. We have witnessed progressive corporates use innovative technology to process data and gain better visibility over their respective positions. Armed with this holistic view, the next step we are seeing many of these companies take is to pull leverage data from numerous external sources, including news wires and social networks, in order to analyse market sentiment, identify anomalies and allow for proactive decision making.</p>
<p>When executing on these decisions, technology once again has a vital role to play. Traditionally when conducting FX, corporates would interact with a pool of banks individually, either over the phone or through a proprietary portal, to obtain the best price for their trades. Today, however, this can be done using multibank platforms such as FXall. In these multibank venues both the buy side and the sell side come together allowing for more accurate, and efficient, price discovery. The solutions also allow treasurers to be much more nimble in their approach to FX, removing the need to pick up the phone and negotiate a deal. This can be particularly useful in times of market turmoil, for instance, when the Peoples Bank of China (PBoC) allowed the renminbi to fall on 11<sup>th</sup> August, FX transaction volumes on the FXall platform increased 600% because corporates knew this was a venue where they could tap the largest amount of dealers and obtain the best price.</p>
<p>Digital solutions are also proving crucial in ensuring that treasurers can meet the increasingly burdensome regulatory reporting requirements being placed upon them. By their very nature, these tools facilitate a digital workflow, providing treasurers with an automatic audit trail which they can then provide to the regulators. Moreover, by creating a digital workflow straight through processing (STP) and centralised FX risk management can be attained, enabling treasurers to ensure the groups FX activities are managed by experts, mitigating the risk of human error.</p>
<h4>As corporate supply chains become increasingly global and complex, how can companies best create and maintain an efficient and scalable risk management framework?</h4>
<p>In many respects the heightened FX risk faced by some companies is a result of their adventures into new markets and the growth, in both the scale and complexity, of their supply chains. Although this has, of course, provided corporates with numerous benefits, it has undoubtedly increased the concern around not only FX but also geo-political, counterparty and operational risk. Corporate treasurers have become progressively more involved in supporting the supply chain both financially and operationally.</p>
<p>Many firms have already consolidated their various local treasury activities into one regional treasury centre (RTC) or in-house bank (IHB) to act as a centre of excellence for multiple functions and allow them to employ the professionals needed to manage their policies and trade execution. It also allows them to streamline all their workflow, especially post trade confirmations, which reduces their operational risk and gives them greater control.</p>
<p>Examples of such behaviours are the establishment of RTCs in Singapore and Hong Kong. These two locations are extremely strategic for corporates wanting to expand in and have a control over their APAC subsidiaries. Depth of capital markets, ease of currency movement, availability of skilled labour and transparent liquidity venues all contribute to the attractiveness of these locations.</p>
<p>The continued expansions into new countries and new markets have exposed companies to new risks, that now treasurers have to handle as part of their role.</p>
<p>A major component of this is counterparty risk management. While many corporates will be well versed in this topic, given its importance during the financial crisis to track exposures to various financial institutions, the scope of their counterparty risk management requirements has grown exponentially to encompass any third party (know your third party – KYTP/KY3P) in the supply chain and even knowing your customer’s customer, given the rigorous enforcement of regulations governing Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Terrorist Financing. Of course, corporate supply chains can contain hundreds if not thousands of counterparties, both upstream and downstream, making KYC a nearly impossible task without assistance from technology. Similar to FX technology, digital KYTP and KYC tools are powered by data and when looking to adopt new solutions corporates are looking for providers they can trust to deliver the most reliable information in the fastest time.</p>
<p>As a leading provider of financial information and data, Thomson Reuters has developed a number of solutions for KYTP designed to help corporates fulfil their due diligence requirements and mitigate risk. Our Org ID service as an example, has been developed with input from numerous senior industry professionals including a number of corporate treasury professionals and facilitates a common standard around KYC and Know your Counterparty processes.</p>
<p>At a fundamental level these services can be used by corporates to screen their third parties, and warehouse and streamline the distribution of its client identity documents. This helps corporates have better risk management for third parties, centralise their KYC, eliminate a lot of the duplicate work that typically takes place and also simplify the process of updating and informing multiple counterparties of any changes to the documents.</p>
<p>For organisations looking for innovative and intelligent data solutions, Thomson Reuters also offers award winning World-Check One. With hundreds of researchers speaking multiple languages across 240 countries and territories, we have a detailed and in-depth insight into these markets and the key risks that exist. This can prove vital in helping the company effectively identify, monitor and pro-actively make decisions around heightened risk counterparties and possibly avoiding any unnecessary financial or reputational damage.</p>
<h4>What role will treasury play in the future in APAC and how can technology help?</h4>
<p>The term ‘the new normal’ is often cited during discussions around China’s attempts to deliver more sustainable and balanced growth and I often borrow this phrase when I talk about the role of the treasury. In my opinion there will be continued volatility in the markets. Regulation, both in-market and extra-territorial, will also continue to increase, making it crucial to understand its impact and make the necessary changes. This is the new normal and, unsurprisingly, against this backdrop, the role of the treasury department will become increasingly important.</p>
<p>To help treasurers meet these challenges, technology, and more precisely open (bank agnostic) technology, will need to be leveraged. And with the global and diverse nature of business today, it is no longer effective to be tied to endless proprietary systems, each with their own strengths and limitations. There is therefore an increasing demand for open technology and platforms as corporates continue to centralise their treasury function and manage their operations in the Asia region, and even the world, from a single treasury hub. This will give treasurers the ability to reduce their costs, harmonise processes, and offer the potential to drive further efficiency and ensure the corporate treasury is resilient and nimble enough to meet the challenges of both today and the future.</p>

<p><em>The payments world is vast and expanding rapidly. While much of the visible progress can only be found in the retail space, banks and other providers are now working increasingly hard on developing creative solutions to bring similar innovations into the corporate banking space. Can treasurers catch up with consumers on the innovation curve?</em></p>
<p>Almost every treasury department will have at least one. They are those tech-savvy, early adopters; paying for their morning cappuccino using an app on their smartwatch, purchasing flights with Bitcoin and making credit transfers from their personal accounts with a few swipes of their state-of-the-art mobile tablet device.</p>
<p>Imagine, then, the disappointment when, every morning, these same treasurers arrive at their desks for work only to find themselves using the very same clapped-out, antiquated technology that they were using five or even ten years ago.</p>
<p>Yes, the global payments market is evolving rapidly. New providers, platforms and tools with the ability to transform the payments experience are coming to the market on a near daily basis now. But while payments may be the ‘bread and butter’ of the treasurer, the vast majority of mobile and other innovations we have seen in recent years have been for the benefit, not of corporate banking customers, but consumers in the retail space.</p>
<p>Does it have to be like this? Matthew Leavenworth, Director of Product Innovation and Disbursement at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofA Merrill), is certain it does not. “The consumer innovations that are happening have no cognitive separation in a treasurer’s mind from their work when they go into the office every day,” says Leavenworth. “What we have to be aware of is that we cannot say that, despite these dynamic new entrants we are seeing on the consumer payments side, we are still going to move blocks of gold because that is what worked for the Rothschilds 300 years ago.”</p>
<h3 id=""digitising-disbursements"">Digitising disbursements</h3>
<p>An example of how recent innovations in retail payments are now, gradually, beginning to permeate the corporate banking sector can be found in the Digital Disbursements solution BofA Merrill launched in late 2014. It is a novel solution to a seemingly age-old problem. When circumstances arise in which companies need to make payments to their customers (for rebates, refunds and claims payments, for example) the most common way of doing so has long been to write and send a cheque. But delivering funds this way is slow, complex and, above all, expensive (in the UK, cheques can cost up to £1 each to process and in the US, processing a single cheque costs on average $4).</p>
<p>What is really interesting about the solution BofA Merrill developed to address this issue is that the inspiration came from the growing success of the peer-to-peer (P2P) online technology that is now allowing individuals to transfer funds to one another’s bank accounts via the internet or a mobile phone. The solution works by directly routing the payment to the bank account of the individual payee’s choosing to use either a mobile phone number or email address as the identifier. Leavenworth recalls the ‘Eureka’ moment. “We thought, ‘why are there still companies sending these one-off cheques to one another?’ So we developed a tool to allow them to use P2P transfers.”</p>
<p>P2P payments are already proving popular in the consumer space. A study conducted last year by Forrester Research expects P2P payments in the US to grow to $17bn by 2019, from $5.2bn in 2014. In Western Europe, meanwhile, the research group forecasts P2P payments to rise at almost 24% CAGR over the same time frame. Can Digital Disbursements enjoy the same rapid take-up as its counterpart in the consumer space is currently seeing?</p>
<p>With the benefits the solution offers, BofA Merrill are confident it will. In addition to aligning its payments solutions for corporate clients with evolving trends in mobile technology, the Digital Disbursements solution can bring about an estimated reduction of in end-to-end disbursement costs by as much as 75% when compared to a physical cheque.</p>
<p>Finally, Digital Disbursements also eliminate the need to obtain and store sensitive bank account information, the problem preventing companies from simply making such payments directly into their customers’ bank accounts. A study performed by the Federal Reserve found that 85% of consumers and 81% of businesses prefer not to provide bank account information to the payee when making a payment. “We brought P2P technology over to the corporate side – it’s been a big success and we were the first to do it,” Leavenworth adds.</p>



<h3 id=""innovation-challenges"">Innovation challenges</h3>
<p>The pace of change in consumer payments of late has been truly remarkable. In just the past few years we have seen new payments providers emerge, new wallets and new form factors – most notably mobile and wearable technologies – and even new, digital currencies like Bitcoin gain increasing traction in markets across different regions.</p>
<p>Treasurers might be big beneficiaries of these developments, with richer and more accessible business data, faster and cheaper transactions and more efficient reconciliation processes. Naturally, though, changes on this scale will also present significant challenges to the treasury community.</p>
<p>Foremost, there is the matter of working out the best way to integrate all of these new payment methods into the corporates cash management systems and processes whilst ensuring they maintain control over the company’s data, Phillip McHugh, CEO, Barclaycard Business Solutions explains.</p>
<p>“The biggest challenge for the treasurer these days is dealing with the increasing biodiversity in the payment space,” he says. Treasurers now need to accept that consumers today want to have more options for payment and that this will inevitably impact the reconciliation process, in some form or another.</p>
<p>Finding the right solution to this issue will be challenging, but the issue can be overcome with the right support. “Integration is going to be key for the treasurer, and because of that it is important for them to be working with providers who can help bring all of those new payment form factors and channels together into a single account or process and avoid unnecessarily complex reconciliations,” he says.</p>
<p>“In an arena where new payments models are continuing to change and evolve, one new payment method doesn’t replace another. The most important matter is to offer customers choice by helping make their everyday lives easier. This is a key business principle regardless of the size or the sector your organisation operates within.”</p>
<h3 id=""guarding-against-fraud"">Guarding against fraud</h3>
<p>Security should always be at the forefront of the treasurer’s mind when dealing with new payments innovations. This may not be such a huge issue with respect to the new consumer payment solutions pioneered by large, well-established technology companies (as a matter of fact, one of the reasons purported for Apple Pay’s success is the attention given to the authorisation authentication layer). But it could well be an issue with some of the smaller, more dynamic solutions providers who have been entering the payments space in droves of late.</p>
<p>As Phil Huggins, Vice President of Security Science at Stroz Friedberg, an investigations, intelligence and risk management firm explains, some of these firms may not be as well-resourced on the security side. “Most start-ups are focused on building something that works, something people like, and delivering it quickly,” he says. “Writing secure code is, by its very nature, very hard. And start-ups simply don’t have the time and resources to focus on security as much in the beginning and so they end up taking on what, in development terms, is called technical debt or security debt, which will need to be paid down at some point.”</p>
<p>Besides treating new entrants with a healthy degree of caution is there anything else treasurers can do to minimise the security risks associated with integrating new payments innovations? Huggins recommends ensuring that the new entrants have completed a threat modelling exercise. “It means they need to understand the solution they are building, in terms of the people, the processes, and the technology. Considering what it is that the bad guys are likely to want, why they would want them, and then go through a process of working out the various ways they might attempt to acquire them and how the solution prevents that. Treasurers also need to work with procurement and cyber professionals to complete a cyber supply chain risk assessment, which considers both the secure software development practices of a new entrant, as well as their operational security practices.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h3 id=""learning-from-bitcoin"">Learning from Bitcoin</h3>
<p>There are many other cases where we see innovations in consumer payments beginning to spill over into the corporate banking space. Blockchain, the distributed database behind the popular new digital payment method Bitcoin, is another example. In early 2015, it was announced that three of Australia’s biggest lenders, ANZ, Westpac and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) are working, or are at least having conversations, with US-based payment technology platform Ripple.</p>
<p>Billed as the world’s ‘first open-standard, Internet Protocol (IP)-based technology for banks to clear and settle transactions in real-time via a distributed network,’ Ripple has the potential to allow banks to make faster payments – in more currencies and into more markets – with lower cost and risk than is possible today. Ripple claims that it can do this because, unlike traditional financial infrastructure, the platform is not tied to governments or third-party intermediaries such as clearing houses.</p>
<p>Instead, Ripple has adopted a similar model to the blockchain (eg a distributed public ledger that is backed and secured by mathematical algorithms) but with a key difference. Unlike the Bitcoin blockchain which relies on mining to create value (a Bitcoin), the Ripple network is powered by participating users agreeing on changes to its ledger every few seconds. As such, banks are able to clear transactions on its network 24/7, 365 days a year in real-time and (by avoiding third parties) without the same level of cost.</p>
<p>Although it is primarily banks that will plug in and use the Ripple network, the speed and low cost that it offers can potentially have a big impact on the service that corporates receive. “Making payments across borders takes time for the bank and incurs costs and – which are ultimately passed onto to the banks’ clients,” says Dilip Rao, Managing Director Asia Pacific at Ripple. “If a bank uses Ripple, the transaction will cost a lot less and also happens on a near real-time basis, so the cost and efficiency benefits can be passed onto the corporate client.”</p>
<h3 id=""engaging-on-t-and-e"">Engaging on T&amp;E</h3>
<p>More evidence that new consumer payments technologies are increasingly disrupting corporate programmes is offered by a recent White Paper commissioned by American Express in partnership with PhoCusWright. ‘The Path to Innovation: Insights on the New Frequent Traveller’, found that corporate travellers, particularly the tech savvy millennial generation, are increasingly aligning their business and leisure expectations.</p>
<p>“This has led to the gamification of corporate expense programmes, with companies seeing incentives, such as allowing employees to retain points earned for business travel, as a way to cultivate programme loyalty,” says Piotr T Pogorzelski, Vice President, Global &amp; Multinational Client Group Europe, American Express. “Furthermore, business travellers who are seeing apps and mobile payments replace traditional plastic cards in their personal lives, are beginning to expect the same high tech, hassle free ways to pay when it comes to business travel.”</p>
<p>Some might question whether travel expenses are less of a treasury concern and more of a human resources issue. But that is misguided. A study carried out in 2014 by Concur reveals that businesses in the UK spend an estimated £8.2bn a year on T&amp;E. Moreover, in some companies, T&amp;E may constitute one of the largest categories of expenditure; for treasurers then, little to no visibility over T&amp;E spend until a claim form is submitted is far from ideal.</p>
<p>The smartphone – a device which PhoCusWright estimates 92% of business travellers own – might just offer a solution to this problem, while also making the management of T&amp;E more convenient for business travellers as well. Corporate professionals on the road can simply upload and attach hotel invoices or train tickets as and when they need to, making them less likely to lose the documentation or make inaccurate claims.</p>
<p>Managers, then, will have the ability to approve an expenses claim (or reject should it not comply with policy) instantaneously while the accounts payable clerk can more accurately tally the submitted and approved claims. Ultimately, this means that the treasurers and CFOs overseeing it all gain increased visibility of T&amp;E payments and, therefore, have more confidence in the process.</p>
<h3 id=""treasury-catching-up"">Treasury catching up</h3>
<p>Over recent years, consumers have sped ahead on the innovation curve to embrace the new providers, form factors and other services now revolutionising the retail payments space.</p>
<p>These same innovations are now gradually beginning to permeate the commercial payments space, however. Treasurers may be characterised from time-to-time as a conservative and cautious bunch with respect to ‘new-fangled technologies’, but now using such innovations increasingly in their everyday lives as consumers. And the more they do, the more impatient they are becoming to use similar tools in their professional lives too.</p>
<p>Now that the demand is there, banks, treasury technology firms and other payments providers are working increasingly hard, and coming up with some highly creative solutions to meet it. There may still be some way to go yet, but if the above examples are anything to go by, it won’t be too long before those tech-savvy, early adopters in the treasury department notice little difference between the technologies they use as consumers and those that they interact with during office hours.</p>


","The payments world is vast and expanding rapidly. While much of the visible progress can only be found in the retail space, banks and other providers are now working increasingly hard on developing creative solutions to bring similar innovations into the corporate banking space. Can treasurers catch up with consumers on the innovation curve?",https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/treasury-practice/strategic-treasury/flower-and-dew-drops-208092931-1920x1080.jpg,2015-09-01,Strategic Treasury,False

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>SEPA has not had an easy ride. The Eurozone took quite some time to get used to the idea of standardised payment processes. The protracted but necessary cross-border discussions between the various stakeholders ensured that many would view it as an exercise in bureaucracy not efficiency. Indeed, now that it is a reality, some are yet to embrace the strategic and transformational benefits SEPA can bring, with focus in the main on tactical implementation and compliance. The truth for all concerned is that the hard work and expense that brought SEPA into being will remain; banks, corporates and vendors need to work together to unlock its potential. For those that do grasp ‘the art of the possible’, a world of treasury optimisation and opportunity awaits. Not least of that potential lies in the increased scope for centralisation.</p>
<h3 id=""centralise-rationalise-optimise"">Centralise, rationalise, optimise</h3>
<p>Companies have for some time been able to globally, regionally and domestically centralise their liquidity using a wide range of tools, such as zero-balancing and cross border sweeping. But what SEPA, and the XML data format in particular, has brought is standardisation. This gives corporates the opportunity to more readily explore the centralising, rationalising and streamlining of their accounts payable (AP) and accounts receivable (AR) processes – even combining these with their existing liquidity structure.</p>
<p>It is perhaps fair to say that most of the market focus, up to the point when SEPA officially went live, was on ensuring compliance and that businesses would be able to carry on with payments and collections. A lot of time and effort was expended on this and once they had made it happen, many felt they needed a break, notes Ian Blackburn, Regional Head of Commercialisation Europe, Payments and Cash Management. The value-adding SEPA benefits that were promised could wait. “I think that hiatus is now reaching an end and corporates are starting to look at how they can use that commonality.”</p>
<p>Many businesses are reviewing their account structures and considering what operational gains can be put in place. “The promise around SEPA is that although it is not perfect, there are further chapters to the harmonisation story – with niche products and specific payment types in certain countries – customers realise that they may not have to have so many accounts in one country,” says Michèle Zaquine, Senior Proposition Market Manager, Europe, Payments and Cash Management. “Businesses may not be able to rationalise as much as they’d like, but they might be able to make operational gains.”</p>
<p>In terms of rationalisation and centralisation, SEPA has in effect become a great enabler although it remains essential to assess what is the most appropriate course of action in the light of existing business models. At the highest level, a couple of different scenarios have arisen, says Blackburn. There are companies that do not necessarily have ‘bricks and mortar’ outside of their home market and SEPA has allowed them more easily to reach an increased number of markets whilst retaining their accounts in one place.</p>
<p>Those that do have a distributed physical presence will have had the benefit from day one of potentially lower prices for payments execution. The fact that SEPA gives a region-wide standard maximum clearing cycle of D+1 (a payment execution time at the latest by the end of the next business day) has equally allowed them not only to have certainty around the timing of their payments but has also facilitated the migration of non-urgent transactions away from the real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) to D+1, bringing cost efficiencies.</p>
<p>“What corporates are now looking at is a broader picture,” says Blackburn. “They are asking if they really need to have as many accounts around the region, how they can reduce their account maintenance fees, and how they might be able to rationalise accounts to simplify their liquidity management.” However, it may be a bit too soon for companies to consider placing all activities under one account, albeit theoretically possible under SEPA. Corporates are understandably focused on counterparty risk, which precludes the ‘one bank, one account’ approach. Also, for certain types of payments, most corporates would want to have accounts in-country. SEPA does not cover cheque or cash and in some markets local clearing systems – such as LCR in France or RIBA in Italy – where if a client is undertaking transactions through those mechanisms, a local account is required.</p>
<p>For banks, this is all part of the exercise of discussing with customers the precise nature of their payment and collection flows, and therefore whether or not certain accounts need to be maintained. This discussion may also include a technology review, considering if an existing ERP module, for example, can be enhanced to cover all operations or if the business wishes to maintain other instances of that system in-country. Zaquine comments that this has become “a much broader discussion” requiring not just an understanding of payment flows but also any issues around working capital optimisation before it is possible to use the available tools effectively.</p>

<h4 id=""payments-collections-and-working-capital-optimisation"">Payments, collections and working capital optimisation</h4>
<p>For companies that do opt for centralisation, even if some accounts must sit outside of that model, a business can still go a long way to optimising its processes and reducing administrative costs. “But, it is easier to centralise the payments side than the collections,” says Blackburn. “Payments information is easier to track (just by extracting payment run files and sharing that information with the unit that is making the payment) whereas receivables are more challenging if the business is not able to control how the cash comes in (reconciliation is a challenge if, for example, the client does not quote references).”</p>
<p>There are signs that the status quo is rebalancing as the emergence of the ‘on-behalf-of’ model becomes more applicable to collections, facilitated by easier global harmonisation of invoice numbering. “Corporates are also keen to learn more about new banking techniques on the receivables side,” says Blackburn. Of note here is the ‘virtual account’ concept. Here, a corporate sets up a central account, or a smaller number of header accounts, on the receivables side. Appended to these accounts will be any number of virtual account number which are uniquely allocated to each counterparty. Each payment can only be routed via the counterparty’s unique account number and this always links back to the relevant main account. This offers a major improvement on the normal reconciliation process.</p>
<p>Other developments have been around data enrichment. Many corporates have realised that XML can be used beyond the SEPA landscape. Zaquine feels that it “really opens up the parameters for them having more useful data.” Combining SEPA XML data with information from outside that process has definite advantages. “By packaging a consolidated receivables management reporting tool for customers that puts all their credit receipts in one place and on one report, it gives clients that enriched data.”</p>
<p>By allocating this data back to their TMS or ERP system, it is possible then to start managing receipts by exception. Consolidation of information facilitates auto-reconciliation in the back office; the system is positioned to inform what has not been received and what is yet to be applied. The potential to lower overheads previously employed on sales ledger management is clear. Further, integrating data into their ERP system allows the corporate to more easily deploy that data for control, reconciliation and working capital purposes (quicker clearing cycles, reduced fees and lower overheads for allocating and matching against the sales ledger).</p>
<p>There is a forecasting and liquidity benefit too. If a corporate can combine the cash side with a more strategic way of looking at Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) and its payments processes, and look to reduce the cycle, this too ties in with working capital improvements. In preparing the ground for a supply chain finance or receivables finance programme that can reduce the time it takes to collect the money, there is potential for an immediate impact on cash flow. Processes such as dynamic discounting can have a similar effect.</p>
<p>“The centralised and rationalised treasury model is also solid ground on which to build a more robust internal governance structure,” says Blackburn. Scalability of risk and control systems becomes more challenging for companies that grow rapidly through acquisition. “But those that have taken the leap and have started to centralise will reap the benefits in terms of governance and future scalability.”</p>
<h3 id=""further-opportunities"">Further opportunities</h3>
<p>By moving to a more centralised treasury model with fewer accounts, it becomes much easier to consider these improvements. “There are many components involved but as the corporate moves along the curve towards centralisation it will see more opportunities to manage its supply chain and business flows,” Zaquine notes. “SEPA and XML are just the foundations for what can become a more optimised model.” She feels that because many corporates have realised that XML is not specifically limited to payments and collections and that it is a global format that has a much wider use. Indeed, the decision by the European Central Bank (via the Euro Retail Payments Board) to press for a region-wide roll-out of an instant payments-type product (similar to Faster Payments in the UK) takes SEPA to the next level.</p>
<p>Specific to SEPA is the Additional Optional Services (AOS) concept. These have been permitted as a means of fine-tuning SEPA’s relevance to specific jurisdictions; extended remittance information required by Finland or France’s Change Account Identification. Some AOSs are very market-specific but if an AOS has the potential for full European reach then Zaquine believes it has the chance to be adhered to by other communities – but it will be the community operating as one, not an individual corporate or the banks, which will make this happen. For this reason, she believes that there will not be a flood of AOS requirements as SEPA gains momentum; they will arise only when the need arises and when the market pushes for it. The real question then around any AOS is its reachability. “If there is not sufficient reachability it will create market fragmentation,” she warns.</p>
<h3 id=""the-changing-face-of-european-payments"">The changing face of European payments</h3>
<p>The whole story, notes Blackburn, then moves further beyond SEPA, becoming one of the European authorities’ FinTech-driven desire to create a level playing field. Although typically consumer-driven, these technologies can quickly impact the corporate space. In addition to promoting the efficient use of existing SEPA tools (SEPA Credit Transfers and SEPA Direct Debits), concepts such as mobile and e-commerce are gaining ground as a means of enabling corporates to access information and to transact in real-time. In part, the new FinTech landscape will be facilitated by proposed revisions to the European Commission’s first Directive on Payment Services (or PSD1) which now has political agreement, at least in principal, to move ahead. Subject to further discussion and final approval by the European Parliament – possibly by September 2015 for a Q3 2017 implementation – PSD2 will mainly affect access to payment accounts, liability for process failures, transparency requirements on charges, and customer authentication measures.</p>
<p>One of its key aspects is the introduction of a regulatory framework ‘conducive to the emergence of new players’ known as third-party providers (TPPs). “It is something we welcome,” says Tony Richter, European Head of Regulatory and Market Delivery, Payments and Cash Management. “We recognise the need for competition; we are working with the authorities in order to make that happen.” In welcoming TPPs, Richter acknowledges that existing regulated payment service providers (PSPs) need to consider how best to work with them as market participants. The PSP view of the TPP concept is not one of out and out defensiveness; indeed there are new opportunities presented. For example, there is nothing to stop a PSP taking TPP status, potentially broadening its product proposition for customers that wish to operate through this channel. Not discounting any approach, HSBC is running an “innovation work-stream” to tap into the new opportunities coming through.</p>
<p>On 6<sup>th</sup> May the European Commission announced its detailed plans to deliver by the end of 2016, a Digital Single Market for Europe with 16 key initiatives grouped under three pillars:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Better access for consumers and businesses to digital goods and services across Europe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating the right conditions and a level playing field for digital networks and innovative services to flourish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maximising the growth potential of the digital economy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>“The objective is to open up competition in the European landscape to allow for digital opportunities to thrive within a clear framework and in the EU Single Market.”</p>
<h3 id=""raising-the-game"">Raising the game</h3>
<p>The coverage of TPPs by PSD2 is also viewed by Richter as a positive step for the overall market in that all newcomers must match the standards to which current PSPs are required to adhere. For service users, this is an important point. “We want to work with the TPPs to develop the market, but there are some areas that we must tackle together, to make sure that other issues are not introduced,” he says. Changing the relationship of the bank with its customers to add, in some cases, a third party which will be transacting on behalf of the customer but over accounts maintained with their bank, demands that the new relationship has at least the same level of security.</p>
<p>With liability for process failure also tabled as part of the new Directive, Richter believes that if a customer has a query about a payment from their account, irrespective of whether they are using a TPP or not, almost inevitably they will contact their account-holding institution (the PSP) to seek redress. “This is a new aspect that will come into play in managing our payments business and we will need to build that into our overall proposition and processes,” he notes, adding that there may be a cost associated with this. With the additional focus in PSD2 on price transparency, all PSPs will need to review how they manage any such changes. As Richter says, a bank cannot just increase prices to cover an increased cost base. “We need to become more efficient in other ways to make sure we can continue to be profitable in the market.” But ultimately, this is good for the market.</p>
<h3 id=""managing-the-broadening-scope"">Managing the broadening scope</h3>
<p>Another area that is covered by PSD2 which needs further investigation is the so-called ‘one leg out’ transaction, the implications of which are “uncertain,” says Richter. The PSD1 was concerned only with payments made within the EEA, involving EEA currencies. PSD2 enables transactions where either the remitting or beneficiary bank is outside the EEA and using non-EEA currencies. Whilst the reach of the Directive itself clearly relates only to that portion of the transaction which takes place within the EEA, what is not yet clear is whether a payment can in practice be managed in this way, considering the need for transparency, security and all the other demands of the Directive. If, for example, a USD payment goes from Europe to the US, how can that portion that is in the EEA potentially be managed differently to that part which is being settled in the US?</p>
<h4 id=""chart-2"">Chart 2: Centralisation: a transverse project</h4>
<p><a href=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/treasury-practice/strategic-treasury/2015-07and08-tt-06-st-chart-02-centralisation-a-transverse-project-967x595.png?la=en&amp;hash=51A2EFE58FD5BFD728CB6FCF9BF6BAD4"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Chart 2: Centralisation: a transverse project"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/treasury-practice/strategic-treasury/2015-07and08-tt-06-st-chart-02-centralisation-a-transverse-project-967x595.png?la=en&amp;hash=51A2EFE58FD5BFD728CB6FCF9BF6BAD4"" width=""967""/></a></p>
<p>These changes may seem primarily to impact PSPs, but as Richter notes, they will mean changes for the relationship with the customers, particularly around documentation. “We will need to review terms and conditions,” he states. “PSD1 was prepared with consumer protection in mind but also applied to corporates. Because corporates have different requirements to consumers, the option of a ‘corporate opt-out’ was included for certain provisions, negotiable between a PSP and its corporate customer. These must be reviewed again in light of PSD2.”</p>
<p>For all stakeholders, only when the Directive is in place will the analysts be able to consider the changes, both in terms of technology and processes. “We are beginning to get a feel for it but there is a lot more work to do,” says Richter. The fact that PSD2 is a ‘work in progress’ does not however detract from the need for discussion to start now. Corporates are advised to keep a watching brief with banks such as HSBC who are well-positioned to provide market intelligence on this topic. Richter has built a team to study the “quite substantial” regulatory developments and changes in the European payments space “so that we can better work with our clients and become a trusted advisor to them.” This creates a space where the bank can reach out to its clients “in a way that gives them an understanding of what’s happening in the industry and the impacts that may be coming their way in due course.”</p>


","The one certainty in the current economic environment is that change is firmly on the agenda. Many may equate this with increased pressure and even risk, especially where the regulatory agenda is seen as one of tighter control.

<p>Earlier treasury benchmarking exercises focused on the organisational elements of the treasury department: the number of full time employees (FTEs) in the treasury team, how much time was spent on risk management in comparison to cash management, how many FX trades were done on a monthly basis, for example. Over the last decade, as treasury has been thrown into the spotlight, more questions have been asked of the treasurer as to the activities undertaken by the treasury team – and more importantly how well (or not) the team performed in managing these activities. In parallel, the increased usage of treasury management systems (TMS) by corporates and the increased capabilities of these TMSs have also significantly enabled the evolution of more operational treasury benchmarking.</p>
<p>The next step in the treasury benchmarking evolution is the measurement and subsequent benchmarking of the ‘value’ treasury is adding to the organisation. Treasury value can be aligned with the creation of shareholder value (SHV) or economic value added (EVA) as introduced by Stern Stewart &amp; Co. in 1982. EVA, however, measures the value of the organisation as a whole and therefore to understand the treasury value a split between business value added (BVA) and treasury value added (TVA) is required.</p>
<p>BVA can be created by focusing on the core business activities: sales growth, profit margin and investments. This is the most important SHV component of a successful company. However, no organisation can be consistently successful without the strategic and operational support from its treasury department. Therefore, TVA can be created by optimising treasury operations, risk management and corporate finance – but this can be easier said than done! Calculating the total TVA for a large multinational can be extremely challenging and treasurers should focus on what drives treasury value.</p>
<p>Here, key indicators can be of assistance and are typically defined based on risk (KRIs), performance (KPIs) and value (KVIs). These will help guide the treasurer to quantify the overall total benefit and purpose of the treasury department.</p>
<p><strong>KRIs</strong> represent early warning signals and limits risk in which treasury needs to operate. The focus is on how corporate treasury manages risk. Examples include: financial covenants, hedge targets and ratios, counterparty limits, financial headroom, risk bearing capacity, earnings-at-risk (EaR) or cash flow-at-risk (CFaR), or rate sensitivity. They can also focus on how well treasury has control over its operations – hedging performance or the overall risk reduction of the organisation, for instance.</p>
<p><strong>KPIs</strong> aim to measure operational excellence of the treasury processes. Examples include: cash flow forecasting accuracy, target weighted average cost of capital (WACC), and speed of account opening and percentage and timing of confirmation accuracy. KPIs generally measure how well treasury is able to perform its day-to-day activities.</p>
<p><strong>KVIs</strong> are the metrics by which the added-value of the treasury function is measured. These are typically based upon the discretionary mandate it has been given by the company. Besides ‘traditional’ operations such as the realised hedging result, treasury can act as a consulting partner to other business units. This ‘intangible’ added-value can be measured in a treasury value scorecard, enabled by technology and reporting from the TMS.</p>
<p>Previously, it was difficult to benchmark different types and sizes of treasury organisations on a specific treasury area but a three-stage approach of: i) gaining control ii) optimising performance and iii) achieving strategic objectives, can help. This allows true ‘value’ benchmarking of a best-in-class treasury, irrespective of type and size.</p>

<p>With the rapid adoption of treasury technology, benchmarking has become a key focus for treasurers. Treasurers are now able to switch their focus to becoming more strategic in their organisations and they have the ability to be more proactive – and benchmarking is a large part of this.</p>
<p>Looking at our corporate clients specifically (we are based in South Africa), the need for cash visibility has been a big agenda item because most of them already have a large footprint across the rest of Africa, or are looking to expand their Africa operations. Typically, the first benchmark that they want to improve is the number of existing bank accounts vs the number of daily reported bank balances. This might seem a simple task for European treasury professionals, but in Africa this is easier said than done. At TreasuryOne, we regularly benchmark client X against client Y to let client X know whether they are ahead of or behind the curve when it comes to cash visibility enjoyed by their peers.</p>
<p>Another trend that we see quite a lot is treasuries benchmarking each other on the number of bank accounts that they have in the group. This is a bit trickier as you need to have two clients in the same or similar industry for this benchmark to make sense. This is especially useful for a client that is currently running a decentralised model to compare to treasuries that are already enjoying the benefits of centralisation.</p>
<p>There are many so-called ‘mathematical’ benchmarks that are widely used, specifically with FX, where treasuries measure their intraday execution in terms of the daily high/low for a specific currency that they trade to measure effectiveness of daily FX trades executed. These mathematical benchmarks are relatively easy to measure if you have the correct tools. The benchmark that we find is of the utmost importance is visibility of FX exposures. These exposures are sometimes kept in disparate systems and sometimes even spreadsheets, and what we have found is that treasurers are not happy with the regularity with which the exposures are measured against hedges. We found that in most organisations where spreadsheets are used, this happens at most once a week. This is only possible if volumes are low, and is unmanageable on spreadsheets when volumes are high.</p>
<p>What we have successfully implemented for a number of treasuries is the ability to integrate the treasury system with the source system where exposures are generated, be it an ordering system or ERP software. In my view, benchmarking exposure visibility is one of the key benchmarks with which treasury performance should be managed, especially on the FX side. Most treasurers are responsible for compliance to board policies relating to exposure vs hedges, but without accurate and timely visibility over exposures this task is extremely difficult and in some cases almost impossible without the use of the correct technology.</p>

<p>To understand how treasury benchmarking is evolving, it helps to look at both the objectives and the methods. One overriding objective is to gain an understanding of your performance against a peer group on predefined factors. This information can be used to identify performance improvements and even inform your strategic direction, as part of a regular review process, or to gain buy-in for a specific transformation opportunity.</p>
<p>Other types of benchmarking that complement this external peer group benchmarking can be overlooked however, in particular, internal benchmarking. Often the greatest value from a comprehensive exercise comes not from a relative score against peers, but from identifying areas of underperformance and better understanding the factors creating that underperformance. Good benchmarking can result in useful insights which have identified areas for real improvement.</p>
<p>In this regard, the next step in the evolution of treasury benchmarking is using external benchmarking in conjunction with a structured analytical improvement programme that utilises a range of techniques and tools. The external benchmark may tell you where you are against your peers, but it does not provide any insight into how to improve and manage performance.</p>
<p>There are many different benchmarking methods, from online surveys and in-person interviews to corporate forums and structured diagnostic workshops. It can be difficult to obtain accurate and applicable peer information, and the information obtained should be applied in accordance with its validity and accuracy. Here, the evolution of treasury benchmarking has meant changing the content and direction of survey questions. However this can be constrained by the need to maintain data consistency and create valid comparisons over time.</p>
<p>Technology has had a dramatic, though not always direct, impact on treasury and this is reflected in the content of benchmarking. For instance, because shared service centres have emerged to enable operational centralisation and to implement and manage standard processes, data standards and ERP, they have become a standard factor in benchmarking surveys. The increased use of technology has also directly resulted in greater benchmarking content on data and system security, technical infrastructure and system delivery such as the cloud and SaaS, and the total cost of ownership and integration with banks and other internal systems.</p>
<p>What is currently under-represented in benchmarking content is the role of treasury in e-commerce. This is a core competency of treasury but is sometimes underappreciated. Greater benchmark information would better highlight this area and demonstrate the added strategic value treasury can provide to businesses.</p>
<p>There are many other areas related to technology that could gain more focus in benchmarking. The management of third party vendors is one, as is the ability to manage across a geographically-dispersed organisation. Exception handling and STP rates could be better incorporated, as could metrics around the interoperability and flexibility of treasury’s operational capability, and the level of technology and process expertise. What is clear is that technology – both directly and indirectly – has significantly changed treasury benchmarking and will continue to do so in the years ahead.</p>

<h4 id=""macro-economic-environment"">Macro economic environment</h4>
<p>Central bank policies on interest rates in the US, UK, Europe and Japan that have long been quite similar are now diverging. Europe and Japan are expanding quantitative easing at the same time the US and the UK are pulling back.</p>
<p>Global currencies are showing tremendous volatility, fuelled by central bank decisions — in January, Switzerland’s central bank abandoned its cap on the Swiss franc’s exchange rate against the euro, throwing global FX markets into turmoil<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Oil prices also surprised the market by dropping below USD 50 for the first time since the financial crisis, and this drop will continue to have a major impact for most companies in 2015. Oil deflation could potentially have a greater impact on economies than fiscal or monetary policy.</p>
<h4 id=""corporate-finance"">Corporate finance</h4>
<p>Corporates have maintained conservative balance sheets even amid the financial crisis recovery, with cash rising from 8.3% of assets in 2008 to 12.7% in 2013 and net debt dropping from 20.8% of enterprise value to 10.9% over the same period.</p>
<p>High internal hurdle rates, averaging 18% among a sampling of S&amp;P 500 firms, are one driver of the cash accumulation. The rates reflect a higher risk-averse disposition towards long-term investments in an uncertain environment.</p>
<p>As a result, activist investors, particularly hedge fund managers, have put further pressure on corporates to acquire or spin off companies rather than stockpile cash and maintain a balance sheet with low-yielding assets.</p>
<h4 id=""regulatory-landscape"">Regulatory landscape</h4>
<p>Regulatory changes, such as those that resulted from Basel III, are often viewed as primarily affecting banks. In fact, they have a major impact on corporates, as the increased costs of regulation lead to higher-priced bank services and a lower supply of credit.</p>
<p>To fuel growth in their own markets, regulators in Asia are taking significant steps toward deregulation and/or liberalisation. Regulators in China further liberalised the market in November 2014, making cross-border sweeps easier and documentation simpler. India allowed Indian subsidiaries to access funding from their international affiliates.</p>
<p>Regulators are also making changes to attract Regional Treasury Centres (RTCs) in certain Asian markets. Hong Kong amended its laws and announced plans to introduce attractive tax incentives, China de-regulated its policies in free trade zones, and policymakers in Malaysia and Thailand relaxed regulations to provide incentives to attract treasury centres in their markets.</p>
<h4 id=""technology-trends"">Technology trends</h4>
<p>Technology is changing significantly as countries and corporates strive to become more efficient. Across Asia Pacific, the trend is toward standardisation, including the use of SWIFT, electronification through sophisticated clearing centres and leveraging mobile penetration to solve last-mile access issues.</p>
<p>Developing countries throughout the region are upgrading their systems from a basic clearing and settlement infrastructure to more efficient digital treasury technology, such as the China National Advanced Payment System (CNAPS) II and an innovative real-time payments platform in Singapore, known as FAST.</p>
<p>Corporates are also enhancing their infrastructure, with many moving to bank-agnostic technology such as the industry standard ISO 20022 format and the SWIFT network. With a focus on treasury management systems, corporates are taking advantage of banks’ investments in innovative solutions in mobile and smart banking.</p>
<h3 id=""navigating-2015-a-treasurers-focus"">Navigating 2015: a treasurer’s focus</h3>
<p>In this dynamic environment, the fundamental short-term and long-term roles of the treasurer in optimising capital and mitigating risk, while increasing operational efficiency and ensuring sufficient control, remain the same. Treasurers look to achieve these objectives by managing cash and funding working capital and capital expenditures, and at the same time, aligning capital structures by achieving the right balance between debt and equity in capital markets.</p>
<p>What has changed, however, are the key actions and decisions treasurers will need to take because of external factors described above. Based on that, we believe most treasurers will prioritise five key activities in 2015.</p>
<h5>1. Create an effective hybrid centralisation model</h5>
<p>To establish the appropriate treasury structure, it is important to fully understand the business drivers, from sourcing and production to how the firm manages fund flows back to the region or repatriate funds to the parent company. It is essential for treasurers to strike the optimal balance between centralisation and decentralisation by understanding what should be centralised to maximise the benefits of an RTC or in-house bank and what needs to remain local.</p>
<p>Particularly in Asia, where infrastructure and regulatory frameworks diverge between markets more than in other regions, achieving an optimal balance between global consistency and local flexibility is of utmost importance.</p>
<h5>2. Diversify sources of funding</h5>
<p>Amidst regulatory changes that may lead to price increases or decreases in credit supply, as well as interest rate hikes, treasurers need to identify sources of funding for both normal business activities and new opportunities. This role, and their deep understanding of the needs for supply chain and working capital funding, are critical because their assessment affects the corporate strategy and determines which projects can be funded.</p>
<p>It is also important for treasurers to target a capital structure that provides financial flexibility to fund growth and prioritise sustainable long-term opportunities. Strategies for successfully managing funding include diversification of sources of funds, optimising excess cash through fee offsetting, spreading maturity dates, and ‘just-in-time’ funding.</p>
<h5>3. Optimise operational efficiency</h5>
<p>Technological advances such as enhanced Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and standardisation enable treasurers to work more efficiently, ensure more effective processing and perform previously-error-prone manual tasks accurately in minutes rather than days. Benchmarking against leading players allows treasurers to critically evaluate the current situation and to better plan their operational efficiency journey.</p>
<p>With the help of technology and information systems, treasurers can apply their skills more effectively by channeling their time and resources into value-add activities and utilising intelligent tools for analytics in order to support and achieve their objectives in the operational efficiency journey.</p>
<h5>4. Develop an enterprise-wide risk agenda</h5>
<p>Given the increasing scope and complexity of regulatory and policy changes both regionally and globally, treasurers can only manage across risk categories well if they fully understand the entire business and what is driving risk. Traditionally, treasurers have focused on FX and liquidity risk. There is now a need to think about combined exposures.</p>
<p>It is also important for treasurers to forecast and manage risk more dynamically and proactively, exploiting their deep understanding of the business to formulate strategies to tackle root causes of risk, rather than hedging against temporary conditions. These include taking a holistic view when looking at changes in the world and counterparties, and devising a sustainable risk management strategy.</p>
<h5>5. Prepare for shareholder activism</h5>
<p>With the rise of shareholder activism and the pressure of bringing increased value to the table, companies are constantly looking at ways to better manage their cash and take advantage of low borrowing rates for mergers, acquisitions, capital expenditures and spin-offs.</p>
<p>Although treasurers do not actively make decisions on acquiring or divesting, they need to be in a position to act swiftly to integrate or adjust core treasury operations based on changes that may arise. Planning ahead ensures an effective funding approach for such activities to readily integrate core treasury operations seamlessly under tight timeframes.</p>
<h3 id=""thriving-in-2015"">Thriving in 2015</h3>
<p>In light of high uncertainty and increasing volatility, corporate treasurers in Asia Pacific have greater opportunities than before to play a key role in achieving corporate objectives and demonstrating their strategic value to the firm. By focusing on these five priorities, treasurers can enhance the competitiveness of their company and ensure they are well prepared to take advantage of any opportunities that come their way.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>When we think about innovation, it’s tempting to skip straight to the ‘exciting’ part. But in addition to understanding the new technologies and channels that are re-shaping the cash management landscape, it is important to grasp how such innovation fits into a corporate’s operating model, and where it can help to solve specific treasury challenges.</p>
<p>Looking first at the macro picture, it’s clear that corporates operating internationally have to contend with numerous external forces that are impacting the supply and/or delivery of goods, as well as the money flows associated with them. Geopolitical developments are one such force, with tensions in Eastern Europe and the Middle East making corporates all the more aware of country and counterparty risk. Indeed, certain geographies are becoming increasingly difficult or undesirable to move funds into or out of, and certain banks are retrenching from non-core countries, leaving some treasurers with significant hurdles to overcome.</p>
<p>“Another factor, which is in many ways correlated to this geopolitical unrest, is currency volatility,” says Mark Buitenhek, Global Head, ING Transaction Services. “The recent strengthening of the dollar, for example, has made it difficult to predict the FX impact on the payments streams of corporates,” he notes. Together with the economic uncertainty surrounding quantitative easing measures and the impact of negative interest rates, these bigger picture concerns are now heavily influencing the day-to-day business of a corporate, and specifically the treasury function.</p>
<p>Financial regulation adds another layer of complexity here. “Even though the vast majority of regulation is being imposed directly on the world’s banks, not corporates, there is inevitably a knock-on effect. Take Basel III, for example: the liquidity coverage ratio and the leverage ratio will impact the availability and cost of certain products of banks going forward, with notional pooling being of particular note,” adds Buitenhek.</p>
<p>As Dick Oskam, Global Head of Sales, ING Transaction Services, explains: “Put simply, under Basel III, banks must calculate their liquidity ratios based on the gross value of individual accounts, rather than netting the outstanding balances of accounts in the notional pool. In order to cover any negative positions in a notional pool, banks must therefore hold more liquidity – which will ultimately make certain notional pooling constructions more expensive for treasurers.” Oskam believes it is too early to say whether the demand for notional pooling will drop off sharply, or whether the product will remain a cost-effective tool for both treasurers and banks. “One thing that is certain, however, is that forward-thinking corporates are already starting to explore alternatives to notional pools,” he observes.</p>
<h3 id=""an-alternative-approach"">An alternative approach</h3>
<p>The logical upshot of these discussions, he says, is to examine the potential of on-behalf-of structures (OBO), namely payments- (POBO) and collections-on-behalf-of (COBO). Although these structures require “a completely different way of operating,” they also offer treasurers the ability to significantly reduce the number of bank accounts they operate, and reduce general administrative expenses. “It’s about getting treasurers to re-evaluate the tools they have become accustomed to. For instance, while a notional pool might offer benefits from an interest point of view, the level of administration to maintain the pool, be it on the side of the corporate or on the side of the bank, is usually quite significant. By implementing a POBO/COBO structure and streamlining the account set-up, it is possible to massively reduce the administration burden, whilst also finding an alternative to notional pooling,” says Oskam.</p>
<p>Another interesting development that is helping treasurers to find alternatives to previously clunky or complex cash management structures is the rise of virtual accounts. These can help rationalise the number of physical accounts held by a corporate, whilst allowing the company to gain superior visibility over its cash and liquidity, and minimising accounts receivable (AR) and reconciliation issues – without adding layers of complexity or expensive technology.</p>
<p>“Although virtual accounts are yet to become globally available, there are certain countries, such as Poland, where they are being used with great success,” Oskam adds.” Of course, in an ideal world, treasurers would be able to operate virtual accounts across the globe, or at least across the European region, but for that to happen we need harmonised legislation, which will take time. It is also due to having various clearing houses and schemes across Europe.” Nevertheless, Oskam believes that virtual accounts offer treasurers significant efficiency potential – and that the benefits will only increase as the solution becomes more pervasive.</p>
<h3 id=""re-writing-the-rules"">Re-writing the rules</h3>
<p>Just as virtual accounts and OBO structures are pushing the boundaries of international cash management, the global focus on instant payments could also dramatically change the way that corporates operate. “Imagine a situation where real-time payments can be made on a 24/7 basis. That would totally transform the way that corporates work – and it’s something the banks are very focused on right now. Not only are we seeing talks taking place in the US, Australia, and across Asia, but there is also a concerted effort around instant payments in Europe, orchestrated by the ECB, local central banks, and banks like ING,” says Oskam.</p>
<p>“Forty or 50 years ago, it took us weeks to get money from A to B. Over the years, the time delay became days, and then within a day. Ensuring that all payments are instant could therefore be the final step that can ever be taken in this area, and we are keen to drive progress towards that real-time goal.” This, Buitenhek explains, is part of ING’s strategy to become a truly digital bank. “Today, there are 23,000 start-ups working in FinTech – the majority of which are looking for ways to improve the customer experience and service, whilst creating efficiencies at the back end. Some of them are looking to work with banks; others are looking to provide an alternative to traditional banking models.</p>
<p>“And whilst competition in the sector should be encouraged, we believe collaboration is the way forward. That’s why we are working with a select group of smaller players across the globe and why we have set up an innovation centre to work towards digitising our complete offering. In fact, we are currently preparing the launch of our new electronic gateway for customers,” he notes. This will be a multi-channel offering, with desktop, tablet and mobile access.</p>
<h3 id=""get-with-the-programme"">Get with the programme</h3>
<p>ING’s – and indeed the wider industry’s – digitisation push is not just about new products though; digitisation is also bringing traditional treasury tools up-to-speed, giving treasurers the benefits innovation, but in a tried and tested environment. “Take corporate cards, for example,” notes Buitenhek. “Today, with the advent of virtual cards, they are being used by corporates not only as a procurement tool but also as a tool for working capital management – since they significantly increase visibility and control, whilst improving payment cycle times and reducing manual touch points. And at a time when the treasurer is increasingly responsible for the whole buying process within the company, this can only be a welcome development.”</p>
<p>Taking this a step further, ING has recently announced a partnership with Basware to support companies with further optimising their P2P process and their working capital management. This partnership will see ING offer an automated invoice payment solution that can be easily added to the existing P2P workflow. “Extending the benefits of electronic invoicing to include payment is an integral part of our strategy of taking advantage of innovation in order to serve the evolving needs of our customers,” Buitenhek explains.</p>
<p>These are just two concrete examples of how digital financial services and e-payments innovation can improve financial processes (including helping to reduce fraud), increase visibility and improve cash flow. But for the treasurer, the true benefits of being able to optimise liquidity positions, in real-time, come alive through the analytical tools that digitisation is fostering. “As well as providing a complete range of e-services, ING is incorporating advanced analytics into our new digital portal. These analytics will not only help the bank to service its customers in the best way possible, but also provide customers with an added layer of information that is only possible through digitisation – including reporting functionality.”</p>
<p>The analytics also give the bank the ability to flag potential opportunities for efficiency within the customer’s business. “For example, the analytics might suggest that, based on your dollar rating or on a supplier’s rating, now would be a good time to set-up a supplier finance programme,” Buitenhek explains.</p>
<p>“In short, it’s about gaining a fuller appreciation of the big picture, whilst identifying specific opportunities to improve, speed up and streamline a company’s working capital management,” he concludes. And where digitisation and innovation allow the treasurer to better react to the company’s current cash and working capital needs, analytics allow the treasurer to better predict what is coming down the line – so that they can take appropriate measures in advance. Forewarned is forearmed.</p>


","Far from being mere industry buzzwords, the rapid evolution of payment systems and solutions, together with the growing digitisation of corporate banking services, look set to fundamentally change the way that corporate treasurers operate. From virtual accounts to in-depth analytics, the digital world is your oyster.",,2015-05-01,Strategic Treasury,True

<p>John Salter is the Lloyds Bank Global Transaction Banking (GTB) Managing Director for Global Corporate and Financial Institution client sectors. Salter is responsible for all aspects of the GTB relationship across these key segments. Prior to this role Salter held a variety of senior positions at Lloyds Bank and other institutions, managing large international sales teams, relationship management, product management and network management. As a member of the GTB Executive Committee, he is part of the leadership team committed to establishing Lloyds Bank as the leading UK provider of transactional banking services.</p>

<p>Given that HR budgets remain constrained, treasurers must think on their feet to maximise the resources at hand – be that through implementing more cost-effective technology, new cash management structures, or simply by leveraging industry expertise.</p>
<p>Here we examine the key trends that are influencing the way treasurers extract hidden value from the business and deliver added-value to stakeholders.</p>
<h3 id=""working-capital-philosophy"">Working capital philosophy</h3>
<p>Despite improving economic conditions, bank regulation – not least Basel III – continues to put increased pressure on the cost and availability of bank finance. As such, ‘working capital management’ is becoming synonymous with ‘cost effective financing’.</p>
<p>In fact, cutting-edge treasury functions are no longer taking working capital for granted or labelling it as a ‘bank product’; instead they are looking to establish working capital optimisation strategies that underpin the business and support long-term growth. There are several common tools and methodologies that leading corporations are leveraging to achieve this goal, including centralisation. Centralisation can not only help to streamline operations, but by bringing working capital responsibilities under one roof, it can also help to improve internal alignment around working capital goals.</p>
<p>Companies are also now looking for smarter solutions to help them build sustainable working capital strategies that create value from existing assets. Solutions such as supplier finance, which offer key suppliers an earlier cash flow injection on better-than-normal credit terms while allowing the corporate buyer to reduce the risk of supplier failure, secure longer settlement periods, and gain an element of exclusivity over the key supplier, are growing in popularity. And with recent estimates from consultancy firm REL suggesting that approximately €762 billion remains tied up in excess working capital across Europe, the opportunity is surely too good to miss.</p>
<h3 id=""regulatory-challenges-and-opportunities"">Regulatory challenges and opportunities</h3>
<p>This year has seen a raft of regulatory challenges – and changes. Among the most significant for corporate treasurers was the introduction of derivative trade reporting obligations under EMIR on 12<sup>th</sup> February. For corporates that fall under EMIR’s scope, all derivative trades (except FX spot) must now be reported to a regulated trade repository (TR), including trades carried out internally. Many transaction banks are helping corporates with delegated reporting services, while vendors are bringing out new reporting tools for corporates that have chosen to connect directly to a TR. Seeking external help can therefore be a significant time-saver when it comes to reporting compliance.</p>
<p>The largest corporates will now need to prepare for EMIR’s mandatory clearing obligations, which are likely to take effect in late 2016 or early 2017. However, some trades entered in to before this date may have to be cleared from the date of implementation – known as ‘frontloading’. Corporates should also be aware of derivative market reform regulations in other jurisdictions, such as the Dodd-Frank Act in the US.</p>
<p>Regulation of the financial sector, such as Basel III, is also indirectly affecting companies through the changing availability and pricing of lending, credit, and trade finance, for example. This means that treasurers need to think carefully about the bank lines they currently have available to them, and how these might change. Open dialogue between treasurers and their banking partners can only assist in properly assessing the impact here – and many high profile treasurers are already doing this. For them, taking into account ‘wallet share’ and ensuring that the corporate/bank relationship adds value for both parties are vital ingredients in ensuring a positive outcome.</p>
<p>Adding to the regulatory complexity are initiatives such as the EU’s Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) which aims to deal with the threat of banks which are ‘too big to fail’. In the UK, structural reform under the guise of the UK Banking Bill or the Vickers Report, is proposing significant changes to the current banking model through the use of ring-fencing, designed to separate a bank’s retail operations from its institutional operations, in order to safeguard retail and SME clients. One of the main challenges for corporates here is that the derivatives offered by the ring-fenced bank (RFB) will be limited.</p>
<p>As these regulatory changes come into effect, corporates are encouraged to have open dialogue with their relationship bank(s) to discuss both the challenges and opportunities that they present.</p>
<h3 id=""cash-management-efficiency"">Cash management efficiency</h3>
<p>When it comes to cash management, the ultimate goal remains 100% visibility and control, while simultaneously managing risk and maintaining liquidity. Innovative industry solutions such as SAP’s financial services network (FSN) are allowing corporates to communicate with many banks though a single window, for example.</p>
<p>SWIFT is also changing the rules of the game. Having been successfully used by many large-name corporates to achieve improved cash visibility, it is now making its services more accessible to mid-tier corporates through its Alliance Lite2 offering.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, despite the hurdles the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) has presented, a number of companies are starting to leverage the structural changes enabled by SEPA (eg rationalisation of bank accounts) as a catalyst to improve cash management efficiency and visibility. That said, there is still much value to be derived from SEPA and the 1<sup>st</sup> August 2014 deadline did not mark the end of the migration process. Not only will corporates in non-euro countries have to comply with the SEPA Regulation by 31<sup>st</sup> October 2016, but many Eurozone companies can still take their SEPA projects further.</p>
<p>SEPA is also driving the use of a number of e-solutions within treasury, which again all add to the clarity of the overall cash picture. Virtual accounts, for example, can significantly improve processing efficiency and allow the real-time capture of transactions.</p>
<h3 id=""tackling-cybercrime"">Tackling cybercrime</h3>
<p>Recent research by internet security company McAfee estimates that cybercrime now costs the global economy £266 billion annually. As the guardians of corporate cash, that figure illustrates very clearly why treasurers must join the fight against cybercrime.</p>
<p>But cyber criminals are not necessarily motivated by profits alone. We are witnessing a growing trend towards cyber terrorism – where institutions and companies are being targeted by ‘hacktivists’ because of their business activities or ethics, not just their coffers or data vaults. What is more, given the constant evolution of technology, cybercrime is becoming increasingly sophisticated and there is no silver bullet.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the treasurer has a duty of care to protect the company’s assets in the face of this evolving threat. To fulfil this duty, treasurers must think beyond their traditional perceptions of cybercrime. While payment fraud remains a significant concern, as does keeping track of the treasury department’s access to and storage of data, ensuring that IT can deploy appropriate solutions is also vital. This means dedicating budget to technology – not only to fund new software and systems, but also to allow for the company’s critical infrastructure to be tested through simulation, rather like the Waking Shark II exercise which saw the Bank of England co-ordinate a major simulated cyber-attack on the UK’s financial sector in November 2013.</p>


<blockquote>Being a successful treasurer is about more than just hitting targets and making the numbers stack up; it’s about adding real value to the company and acting as a strategic business partner. The treasury function can support the growth and operational goals of the company by leveraging the strong banking relationships that it has nurtured.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source""></p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Like the banks, corporates may also wish to consider seeking expert advice from consultants and technology leaders around cybercrime – as well as setting up business units tasked specifically with managing the company’s cyber defences. And although a great deal can be done to prevent cybercrime, having a plan in place to deal with a breach if one occurs will be extremely beneficial.</p>
<h3 id=""treasury-as-a-value-creator"">Treasury as a value creator</h3>
<p>Being a successful treasurer is about more than just hitting targets and making the numbers stack up; it’s about adding real value to the company and acting as a strategic business partner. The treasury function can support the growth and operational goals of the company by leveraging the strong banking relationships that it has nurtured. This entails not only securing affordable access to funding, but also choosing a forward-looking bank that will deliver an efficient cash management infrastructure.</p>
<p>Assisting the company in retaining its competitive edge by assessing the latest treasury technology, or bank innovations, is another facet of the treasurer’s developing role in value creation. Similarly, using technology to analyse key metrics that paint a clear picture of the company’s health and ability to withstand adverse scenarios, can help treasurers to add value the board by turning what was previously seen as ‘data’ into genuine information.</p>
<p>Finally, communication skills are becoming a highly valuable attribute in the treasury function. In addition to board-level communication, there should be a constant flow of information, and a sharing of best practices between the treasury function and other internal departments such as legal and accounting, tax, procurement, sales, and credit control to help enable the company to achieve its full growth potential.</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>DCC is an international sales, marketing and distribution business with revenue of circa €14 billion. Headquartered in Ireland, most of DCC’s revenue is generated internationally, in the UK and in Continental Europe. The Group now has over 10,000 employees and operations in 13 countries across three main divisions – energy, technology and healthcare.</p>
<p>Although DCC’s ongoing international growth means that the Group primarily looks to international economic indicators, Kelly notes that “the Irish economy is turning a long-awaited corner and measured optimism is the order of the day for investors, individuals and businesses alike. Employment rates are rising, GDP growth has picked up significantly and tax revenues are also increasing. In short, all the key indicators are trending positively.”</p>
<h3 id=""strategic-treasury"">Strategic treasury</h3>
<p>According to Kelly, DCC’s expansion in Continental Europe has benefitted from the Group’s experience in the UK and its strong relationships with the oil majors and its other supply partners.</p>
<p>Here, he stresses the importance of long-term relationships to DCC, and explains how the Group’s conservative financial strategy has always been a significant plus point for its suppliers. “As a Group, we are very focused on having a strong balance sheet. Having long-term debt and strong liquidity positions on the balance sheet has, over the years, proved to be a competitive advantage for us: in terms of our relationships and negotiations with our key suppliers and partners,” he says. “When we buy distribution businesses from the oil majors, they are replacing a diversified stream of smaller cash flows with a single cash flow and it’s important to clearly demonstrate the ability to readily meet monthly product payments.”</p>
<p>So how does DCC manage this? “Well, we are and have always been well-funded. We tightly manage our working capital and we maintain a relentless focus on Return on Capital Employed (ROCE). We go to the markets well ahead of needing funding and we think strategically about when to issue,” Kelly points out. Testament to this is the fact that the Group has been to the US Private Placement (USPP) market seven times since 1996. The two most recent issues, in February 2013 and March 2014, raised $525m and $750m respectively.</p>
<h3 id=""sharing-knowledge"">Sharing knowledge</h3>
<p>Historically a dollar-denominated market, Kelly reveals that there are now significant direct currency capabilities in the USPP market, a market which now includes increasing numbers of UK and Continental European investors. “Even US debt investors now have the ability to provide local currency by putting in place their own hedges,” he explains. DCC included sterling and euro tranches in its USPP this year: some of which was provided by investors who had natural balances in those currencies; some of which was provided by US investors who undertook swaps in the background.</p>
<p>Kelly will be talking more about developments in the USPP market – and sharing the secrets of DCC’s long-term success in that market – at the IACT’s Annual Summit in the Gibson Hotel in Dublin on 6<sup>th</sup> November. A keen supporter of the IACT, Kelly appreciates the organisation’s focus on both disseminating best practice and representing corporate treasurers in an environment of continuing change. SEPA and EMIR are two good examples here, he notes. “The IACT has done a great job of keeping its members informed of developments and also in representing them in the context of fairly significant changes in the industry.”</p>
<p>These changes will no doubt be discussed at length by attendees during the IACT Summit, where regulation, evolving technology and the increasing sophistication of payments fraud, are likely to be talking points around a comprehensive conference programme, says Kelly. But “rather than lamenting the challenges that change brings, this evolution is actually an enormous opportunity for treasurers to revisit legacy structures and processes and strategically position their businesses for ongoing growth,” he concludes.</p>

<figure class=""portrait left""><img alt=""Portrait of Michal Kawski"" height=""150"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2014/06/2014-06-tt-02-qa-michal-kawski-100x150.jpg"" width=""100""/></figure>
<h5 id=""michal-kawski-gazprom"">Michal Kawski, Head of Treasury, Gazprom Marketing &amp; Trading:</h5>
<p>At Gazprom Marketing &amp; Trading we operate a fully centralised global treasury function headquartered in our London offices. The department has been structured so that it facilitates strategic partnership and ensures continuous interaction with other areas of the business. Overall, it is our role to understand the business requirements and ensure that we deliver these quickly and efficiently. To do this, we provide quality support for the business in any geographical location and at any time of the day.</p>
<p>To achieve our role as strategic partner to the business, we have implemented an operational model which applies to both the business units and the entities. Firstly, our support to the entities (namely our subsidiaries) is managed and analysed by our cash management team, which focuses on their short-term objectives. One member of the team is assigned to an entity, or a group of entities, and acts effectively as a treasury manager for these, maintaining key discussions in areas such as short-term cash and liquidity management. These managers are also supported by the local financing and accounting teams on the ground that assist in reporting the treasury requirements and ensuring that we can meet them.</p>
<p>Our support to the business units on the other hand, focuses on their medium to long-term strategies, offering analytical support for these. We apply a similar structure to our support for the entities, allocating a member of our liquidity team to a particular business unit. These then work alongside their unit and offer assistance on a plethora of treasury issues, such as their working capital requirements, interest rate costs and FX implications, to name just a few.</p>
<p>Treasury is also deeply involved in the cash side of the business units’ planning and budgeting process when developing a financial strategy. As a department we interact with the business units and discuss treasury related factors which can impact them, such as their cash profile and cash requirements. We then evaluate this information and estimate the costs of funding, helping to derive a financial strategy for that business unit.</p>
<p>It can often be the case when treasury gets centralised that treasurers disappear from the subsidiaries and from companies across the group as the department begins to detach itself away from the rest of the business. This directly impacts communication channels and the ties with the rest of the business begin to disappear. Because of this, strategic decisions will not be well informed from a treasury point of view, and to my mind, centralisation will fail if treasury doesn’t become a strategic business partner.</p>
<p>At Gazprom Marketing &amp; Trading, communication amongst the group is a key driver to how our business operates. The structure of the treasury therefore has been designed specifically to allow information to efficiently flow through the department. This permits us to accurately anticipate the requirements and respond to these quickly and efficiently. We can also communicate where the company sits with regards to funding and liquidity levels, which has a direct impact on the decision making process of the commercial side of the business and allows us to become a strategic business partner.</p>
<figure class=""portrait left""><img alt=""Portrait of Ciar Timon"" height=""150"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2014/06/2014-06-tt-02-qa-ciar-timon-100x150.jpg"" width=""100""/></figure>
<h5 id=""ciar-timon-honeywell"">Ciar Timon, Senior Regional Treasury Manager, Honeywell:</h5>
<p>A winning treasury organisation is one which clearly demonstrates how it can add real value for its company to both operational activities and projects. Treasury needs to be a proactive partner to the company, not just responding to specific requests but continually providing information about any new technology or processes which can enhance the company’s business model and drive efficiencies. There should be constant communication and a sharing of best practices between treasury, tax, contracts, credit control, legal and accounting departments and treasury should also foster a relationship between the company and the banks.</p>
<p>Honeywell treasury’s role is to support the acquisition, growth and operational strategies of the company and to leverage strong banking relationships to this end. We become involved early in the acquisition process, participating in the due diligence exercise and then working on the integration of the acquired company – some treasury processes can be put in place even before the deal is signed. Within a short time, our customer and value-focused strategy can produce cost savings, process improvements and elimination of waste.</p>
<p>We support Honeywell’s global growth strategies by anticipating the company’s needs and providing solutions. In each country or region, we provide our businesses with a bank capable of supplying the most forward-looking, efficient and cost-effective cash management infrastructure, with a strong, secure control environment and robust processes. Our strategy is to standardise and automate every process where practicable. However, we don’t automatically accept the status quo, but adopt an approach which takes into account the cultural, regulatory and logistical constraints in each country.</p>
<p>Treasury should be able to demonstrate quantifiable returns. A strategy of using one bank per country and strong negotiating tactics has enabled Honeywell to take advantage of economies of scale and to reduce cash management costs dramatically. Improvements in electronic banking connectivity, automation of banking processes and online bank guarantee solutions produces measurable time savings. Elimination of waste, eg the closing of redundant bank accounts and monitoring and cancellation of expired bank guarantees, results in tangible cost savings as well as freeing up precious bank guarantee credit lines. The implementation of an inter-company netting process, such as the one we have set up with Bank Mendes Gans, reduces payment flows and associated costs to one per month, as well as minimising foreign exchange costs.</p>
<p>Honeywell treasury’s role also includes: implementing the use of cash pools for cash concentration, to allow effective deployment of funds from cash-rich to cash-poor entities and to minimise external borrowing; focusing on key metrics and analysis to assist the businesses with decision-making; ensuring the implementation of full cash visibility for planning and investment purposes; promotion of hedging programmes to minimise foreign exchange risk; and reduction of bank guarantee risk by promoting the use of standard wording and by regular training which emphasises the implications of using non-standard wording, for example, open-ended expiry and assignment clauses.</p>

<h5 id=""sander-van-tol-zanders"">Sander van Tol, Partner, Zanders:</h5>
<p>Integration between treasury and the business is a prerequisite for an effective and efficient treasury organisation. The remit of the treasury function has changed over the last few years, and treasury is now expected to be much more of a pro-active advisor to the company.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the added-value of the treasurer was primarily based around how to manage cash flows effectively. This rather operational role of the treasury function has gradually evolved over the last decade towards treasury becoming more of a strategic partner to the business.</p>
<p>Currently, treasury is seen as the expert in the quantification of financial risks and the time value and accessibility of future cash flows. The specific knowledge around those two areas, quantification of financial risks and time value of money, can and should be used in an integrated way towards the business. There are numerous examples of where this specific knowledge is required and can add value to business processes, for instance in the capital allocation process. Treasury plays a leading role in advising the CFO on decisions around complex investments, taking into account country specific risks, diversifying companies’ debt portfolios, project-specific WACC calculations and impediments from restrained cash.</p>
<p>Yet another, mostly still undiscovered, area where treasury can play a pivotal role for the business is on the commercial side. Best market practice is to evaluate (forecasted) sales by taking into account financial risk factors. By measuring the risk adjusted return on sales (RAROS) the company can gain greater insight into the true profitability of individual projects and business transactions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with treasury’s integration with the business, we are seeing the scope of the treasury function increase, to include areas such as pension funds, working capital management, credit risk management, insurance and procurement. With regard to the latter, treasury is often asked to support procurement around purchasing commodities and energy, as well as managing the related financial risks from this process.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, in the area of managing working capital, treasury is well positioned to take a leading role to work towards a more efficient use of cash within the supply chain. With financial supply chain management, the company is able to decrease working capital while at the same time increasing supply chain resilience. This is vital for most corporates, since supply chain disruptions are proven to be costly.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop and with the increased focus on centralisation and standardisation that we are seeing with treasury working in close co-operation with AR and AP departments, companies are increasingly outsourcing their payments, and to some extent their collections process, to a shared service centre (SSC). With the use of a payments and collections factory and concepts like payment on behalf of (PoBo) and receivables on behalf of (RoBo), corporates are able to significantly increase efficiency, control and visibility. In the light of increased demand for real-time visibility and accessibility of global cash positions this is considered best market practice.</p>
<p>In short, due to the increasing ‘added-value’ brought by the treasurer to business processes, the remit of the treasury function has actually grown. Treasurers should grasp the opportunities that this change brings, thereby adding even greater company value.</p>

<p>Everything that is of an executional and repetitive nature in treasury can be outsourced. Aspects of treasury which should definitely not be outsourced include strategy, bank relationships, pricing discussions and treasury controlling – all of these services should remain under the purview of the treasury department, not an outsourcing provider.</p>
<p>If you are thinking about outsourcing, it is important to have your own house in order in terms of processes. I do not think that by outsourcing a treasury service you can solve your internal problems. For example if you are considering outsourcing your exposure reporting because your accounting system doesn’t allow you, for some reason, to get regular information about your exposure, then outsourcing is not going to help resolve the problem. Before outsourcing, treasury must first correct issues such as these.</p>
<p>The second pitfall could be communication between the company and the outsourcer, such as a bank. In my experience, there can be discrepancies between language spoken by corporate treasury versus language used by the banks.</p>
<p>I think treasurers themselves see less of the value in outsourcing and more of the risks involved – and this could explain why outsourcing is not used more often in corporate treasury.</p>

<h5 id=""eddie-fogarty-managing-director-fti-treasury"">Eddie Fogarty, Managing Director, FTI Treasury:</h5>
<p>If you are outsourcing a manufacturing process you would specify the end result and, whatever the product, you would hope to have returned an exact quantity to match that specification. The difference in the treasury world is that treasury is a process that must be integrated with the core business. That is why in our business we tend to speak more of ‘managed treasury’ as opposed to outsourcing, so as to differentiate from activity that can be contracted out to third parties.</p>
<p>Without overstating it, I think most or nearly all treasury processes are open to outsourcing. The key issue is: how is that done? When a core treasury process is ‘outsourced’, it has to stay integrated with the rest of the business. So, while I can certainly say that cash management, inter-company lending, netting, even operational foreign exchange (FX) management and transactions can all be outsourced, I would not suggest that those processes are lifted out of the enterprise and managed remotely by the service provider.</p>
<p>One of the greatest challenges is at the very outset with the decision itself. In my experience, some enterprises are comfortable with the concept but others see risk in going down that route. Clearly it is a significant decision. Everyone realises that treasury is an area of high risk, yet there are benefits to the business if outsourcing is done the right way.</p>
<p>Developing the correct analysis of what is proposed, what is envisaged and how it can be structured so that those risks are taken out of the equation is one of the biggest challenges. In our experience at FTI Treasury, the clients that work with us often say that they don’t know why many other companies don’t do it when they see how it runs in practice.</p>
<p>Having taken the decision, there will be further challenges but those can be dealt with by ongoing management. If a large US multinational company (MNC) is looking to set up a treasury centre in Europe – for example in Dublin or Brussels – then they are going to recruit people and acquire systems. In a sense, doing that through a managed treasury is not vastly different than doing it ‘in-house’. The key difference is that the staff, in that example, are on the payroll of the company itself. But the start-up process itself can be quicker, and you have an easier wind-down option, if necessary.</p>
<p>However, fundamentally the business is going to be conducted in a broadly similar way, albeit with stiffer terms and conditions, and stronger reporting, more contact points, more reviews, reporting and so on. Fundamentally, the management task from a treasurer or CFO perspective is not hugely different in a treasury operation run at a distance from that of one managed on an outsourced basis.</p>
<p>The treasurer has to engage with the service provider and the service provider will have to customise the solution. As each company is different, off-the-shelf products have limited appeal in this area. If the solution is developed properly, it will enable the level of confidence to be built that will allow the decision to go ahead.</p>
<p>At FTI Treasury, we think it is essential that we engage strongly with the parent treasury – that is good for the relationship, it is good for the business and it is good for risk management on both sides. Also, it is important to remember that it is never a question of ‘out of sight, out of mind’. The problems are not off your desk if you are the treasurer; all of the same issues are there – the only difference is the work is being done on your behalf by other people.</p>

<p>The most frequently cited reasons to outsource include cost savings, technology changes, flexibility of operations, access to skilled talent and scalability of operations especially for growth organisations. The pitfalls and potential dangers are harder to quantify, but from our experience they are centred around several core challenges including loss of control, layers of communication, lack of support from the wider organisation and over-dependence on providers.</p>
<p>Expectations also trip up many major initiatives, with some of the best and brightest firms setting themselves up to fail by building unrealistic expectations.</p>
<p>In making the decision to outsource, key issues include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Be specific.</h5>
<p>Understand your exact needs by creating a balanced value/risk proposition mapping out your strengths and weaknesses across the treasury operations. Don’t limit the scope of this analysis as this will limit the scope of your perspective – most see outsourcing only for low value transactional operations, but many banks and advisors also provide higher-value services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Set expectations.</h5>
<p>Be realistic and set them early on in the planning process. Revisit them often.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Be critical and merciless in managing your timelines.</h5>
<p>The smallest glitches can have wide-reaching knock-on effects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Set KPIs and measure them religiously.</h5>
<p>Continue to refine them throughout the year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Consider the alternatives, including shared services.</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Know your exit strategy.</h5>
<p>Failure to thoroughly plan your exit leaves you open to being held hostage by your providers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Outsourcing is really a build or buy choice and, as with any organisational restructure, policy and planning will be crucial but the only opinion that matters is yours. While vendors and advisors will provide countless estimates and ROIs on the value/risk benefits, if you don’t consider all of the options fully, mistakes could prove to be costly, if not catastrophic, in the future.</p>

Why using the renminbi can help companies cut costs and grow,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>At present just over 10% of China’s trade is conducted in the renminbi (RMB), but this percentage is expected to at least triple in the next two years. Corporate treasurers should be taking full advantage of the benefits of China’s currency liberalisation programme and actively taking part in shaping its future direction. But what, exactly, are the benefits of trading with RMB?</p>

<h4 class=""fn"">Diane S. Reyes</h4>
<h5 class=""title"">Global Head of Payments and Cash Management</h5>
<img alt=""HSBC"" class=""logo org"" height=""16"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/hsbc-logo-2013-90x16.png"" width=""90""/>
<p>Diane S. Reyes was appointed in September 2011 as HSBC’s Global Head of Payments and Cash Management, a multi-billion dollar business operating across five regions and over 60 countries and territories. She is responsible for over 80 products and services offered to Corporates, Financial Institutions and Governmental Organisations. Reyes has over 20 years of financial services experience across a number of financial institutions with an emphasis on Sales, Client Service, P&amp;L, Product and Risk Management in Transaction Banking. In her current role, Reyes is focused on improving the client experience around cash management and payments both locally and across borders and currencies.</p>

<p>For companies doing business with China, or competing for a share of its growth, the renminbi (RMB) should be seriously considered as an integral part of a cash management strategy that not only seeks an effective way to settle trade, but also facilitates investments and deepens relationships.</p>
<p>“If that sounds like a bold claim, consider how far China has opened itself to the world in a short span of time,” says Diane Reyes, HSBC Head of Global Payments and Cash Management. It is true that global trade with China has grown rapidly over recent decades, pulled forward by the twin locomotives of extraordinary Chinese domestic growth and increasingly transnational industrial assembly lines. HSBC research indicates that Chinese gross domestic product (GDP) is set to increase by 8.6% in 2013, and next year China will add more to global economic growth than ever before.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, China has been loosening controls on the RMB to help establish it as a global trade currency and, eventually, a global reserve currency. The RMB is still a newcomer amongst global currencies. By the end of 2012, just four years after China first began trade settlement in renminbi, it accounted for some 12% of China’s external trade settlement. HSBC expects that to rise to 30% by 2015, which would make it the world’s third largest trade currency. The view from HSBC’s chief economist in China is that RMB will be fully convertible by 2017.</p>
<p>The bank is fully engaged with this prospect and commissioned a survey, conducted by Neilson during May and June 2013, to look at the usage of RMB by more than 700 international businesses across China, Hong Kong, Australia, Singapore, the UK, the US and Germany.</p>
<p>The survey shows that 50% of all international companies in Hong Kong and 30% in mainland China are using RMB to conduct cross-border business, exploiting a natural trade flow. But just 11% of businesses surveyed in Singapore, 11% in the UK, 9% in Germany, 9% in the US and 7% in Australia currently use RMB in their trade activities.</p>
<p>Of those that do use it, most are settling transactions with intragroup trading partners but over 50% are also settling with external counterparties. Although import and export activities are prevalent amongst RMB transactions, capital injections and documentary credit/trade financing are also common in Hong Kong and mainland China respectively.</p>
<h3 id=""resistance"">Resistance</h3>
<p>However, 61% of Chinese companies say their counterparties are unwilling to consider using RMB. The main reason, cited by 38% of respondents, is the perception that there is no clear benefit in doing so. In addition, 34% of Chinese companies say their counterparties are simply unwilling to use RMB and 31% say they are not fully considering its use, with smaller businesses even less likely to have considered using RMB at any point.</p>
<h3 id=""education-and-awareness"">Education and awareness</h3>
<p>Perhaps there is good reason for the apparent resistance so far to using the RMB: the survey also reveals that 52% of companies have a limited understanding of the processes behind the progressive internationalisation of the RMB. And whilst just one in ten feel that they have a solid and up-to-date understanding of RMB services, more than a quarter of users acknowledge their poor understanding of RMB services – a figure that rises to over half for non-users.</p>
<p>But practical difficulties may be felt by some companies. Documentation requirements and a lack of clarity on regulations are cited as the two key difficulties encountered in RMB cross-border settlement, especially in Hong Kong and Singapore. In China, barriers to adoption are more related to counterparties having difficulties obtaining, or no use for RMB.</p>
<p>In the next phase of development, awareness and education around the core benefits of using RMB in trade and payment settlements are vital if companies are to push ahead in this key market.</p>
<h3 id=""treasury-benefits-of-rmb-liberalisation"">Treasury benefits of RMB liberalisation</h3>
<p>So what are these key benefits and why should corporate treasurers and chief financial officers (CFOs) care about the internationalisation of RMB? A quick look at the positives discovered by those already using it reveals much for potential users.</p>
<p>For those companies already using RMB, HSBC’s study highlights a number of drivers for adoption. Foreign exchange (FX) risk mitigation is cited by 48%, followed by meeting demand from their counterparties (46%) and trading convenience (42%). Over half of the current users also feel optimistic about the growth of RMB cross-border business in 2013. What’s more, 73% are expecting a rise in the next five years – 27% predicting growth of 20% or more. It perhaps comes as no surprise that companies with a better understanding of RMB services are able to feel more optimistic about its increasing usage over the next five years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“By settling in the Chinese supplier’s currency, businesses may now be able to avoid this additional cost.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those yet to use RMB for trade, there are three key factors that are piquing their interest. Most respondents (59%) cite mitigation of FX risk, 42% say better pricing and 39% point to the ability to offset market disparities between onshore and offshore RMB markets. Companies with a lower turnover are more motivated by more competitive pricing whilst reduction of FX risk/cost is seen as a strong enabler for Chinese, Hong Kong and Singaporean companies. UK companies are more likely to be motivated by cheaper pricing from suppliers.</p>
<p>It is evident that through a combination of RMB trade settlement procedures and FX hedging, companies may reap considerable savings from the increasing liberalisation of RMB controls. But there are further clear benefits in using RMB for trade.</p>
<p>“In the past, Chinese suppliers have typically needed to add a buffer of between 1-3% to their quotes to hedge against unfavourable exchange rate movement before a trade settles,” notes Reyes. “By settling in the Chinese supplier’s currency, businesses may now be able to avoid this additional cost.”</p>
<p>How? Within the survey, of those Chinese companies involved in international business, 41% are willing to consider discounts of up to 3% on RMB-denominated settlement, while 9% are ready to give even larger discounts. Some 53% of Chinese businesses surveyed say they would offer discounts of up to 5% for transactions settled in RMB. Of all companies prepared to offer discounts, those with a sales turnover of between $3m-$30m say they would be more willing to do so than those with a turnover greater than $30m. Likewise, current RMB users are more willing to offer price incentives than current non-users.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Development in cash management regulations mean that investments in China can increasingly be treated as they would in any other market, allowing funds to be deployed efficiently and conveniently.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id=""making-trade-easier"">Making trade easier</h3>
<p>Simplification of procedures is seen to be the most effective way to encourage usage across all markets. Over half (51%) said that their RMB usage would increase if the processes involved were made easier. Whilst expansion of RMB transaction types is also important to boost the usage in mainland China and Hong Kong, further liberalisation will also stimulate greater usage in Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and the UK. But even amongst users of RMB, simplification of procedures is key to encouraging increased usage.</p>
<p>Although the RMB’s life as an international currency only began in 2009, Reyes points out that its rapid development has been helped by the authorities’ progressive removal of restrictions. Other remaining RMB restrictions are also being relaxed. Between 2011 and 2012, the share of China’s inbound foreign direct investment (FDI) conducted in RMB leaped from 12% to 35% as multinational corporations (MNCs) recognised the benefits of centralising their treasury operations offshore and using China’s currency for local capital injections. Today, notes Reyes, “development in cash management regulations mean that investments in China can increasingly be treated as they would in any other market, allowing funds to be deployed efficiently and conveniently.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We are witnessing acceleration in China’s financial liberalisation, with positive impacts on cash management,”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an example, major banks can enable a customer to use RMB to settle cross-border payments and collections on a gross-in, gross-out settlement basis with the parent company’s overseas treasury centre, which can then be settled directly with the counterparty through a payments factory or shared service centre (SSC).</p>
<p>Before this, each transaction had to be settled on an individual basis directly with the counterparty; increasing transaction costs, currency risk and fragmenting payment processes for treasuries. For Reyes, this new approach allows for improved management of FX exposures and optimises liquidity management for the company and, she adds, “it sets a precedent for other corporations that will ultimately help boost circulation of RMB outside mainland China”.</p>
<h3 id=""pilot-progress"">Pilot progress</h3>
<p>The benefits to both Chinese and foreign corporations in China are clear: payment processes can be conducted more promptly and efficiently, and can be centralised into a payments hub or SSC more easily. Further, payment timing can be predicted more easily, enhancing working capital and cash flow forecasting.</p>
<p>“We are witnessing acceleration in China’s financial liberalisation, with positive impacts on cash management,” Reyes comments. Indeed, treasury management solutions involving RMB are evolving quickly, albeit on a pilot programme basis (led by the central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE)). A catalyst for this has been the need to include excess RMB balances in China with a company’s offshore RMB pools, in locations such as Hong Kong, Singapore and London, to optimise internal regional and global treasury management structures. “Hence, we anticipate new pilot projects for RMB cross-border sweeping in the near future, as part of China’s continued development objectives for RMB to become an international currency.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“By adopting RMB today, companies can build strong relationships with a wider network of Chinese partners,”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With its natural trade flow with China, Hong Kong has played a leading role in the global expansion of RMB and remains the largest, best developed offshore market. But China is in the process of widening the network of clearing centres outside the mainland.</p>
<p>As the pool of RMB liquidity grows in locations outside China, the need for offshore clearing mechanisms to facilitate RMB transactions increases. For example, Singapore has recently become another RMB clearing centre for Asia, in addition to Hong Kong, and London for Europe.</p>
<p>“These international clearing infrastructures could be linked when the new RMB international payment system in China, the China International Payment Scheme (CIPS) is rolled out in 2014,” notes Reyes. CIPS will be based on SWIFT standards, including International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) 20022 formats and ISO currency codes; the aim, she explains, is to facilitate straight through processing (STP) and “greater international cohesion”.</p>
<h3 id=""new-suppliers-new-consumers"">New suppliers, new consumers</h3>
<p>Despite the reticence of some respondents mentioned above, and the clear need for an educational and awareness programme, 24% of those surveyed signalled their expectation to be using the currency within the next five years. Interestingly, companies who stated regulation and process as a barrier to using RMB also appeared to have a higher predisposition to using RMB in the near future, a sign perhaps that these difficulties are not insurmountable, especially given the initiatives launched by the authorities.</p>
<p>In fact, over the next three years there is a high degree of stated intention to use RMB in Hong Kong (36%), mainland China (33%) and Singapore (20%). For all non-users of RMB, again it perhaps comes as little surprise that the intention to use it in the next three years is significantly higher amongst those with a better understanding of the benefits.</p>
<p>“By adopting RMB today, companies can build strong relationships with a wider network of Chinese partners,” says Reyes. “Because the RMB is convenient for Chinese counterparties, importers who use it potentially open themselves up to a new layer of Chinese suppliers who may prefer the ease of using their own currency, or who may be reluctant to take on dollar exposure because their cost base is denominated in RMB.”</p>
<p>What’s more, it may pay a “relationship dividend” for those looking to sell into China. “Being an early adopter of RMB in your treasury can help secure market share as competitors jostle for position in one of the world’s fastest-growing consumer markets.” It is worth noting that HSBC’s research suggests that between now and 2050 the average Chinese worker’s income is projected to increase seven-fold, from around $2,500 to about $18,000, giving some sense of the potential for growth this market holds.</p>
<h3 id=""corporate-treasurers-can-contribute-to-liberalisation"">Corporate treasurers can contribute to liberalisation</h3>
<p>Financial liberalisation is set to continue, realising the Chinese government’s ambitions for RMB to be a leading currency offshore and for cities such as Shanghai and Beijing to become major international financial centres by 2020.</p>
<p>However, regulators are not pursuing this strategy in isolation. Reyes points out that the collaborative nature of the pilot schemes, including the regulators, banks and corporate customers, means that treasurers have an important role to play in shaping financial liberalisation and prioritising new developments. “It is important that treasurers remain up-to-date, not only with new opportunities to enhance their cash and liquidity management position in China, but also in understanding which pilot projects might be relevant to their business,” she advises. “By becoming involved in pilot projects, companies can help to shape new developments and gain early advantage.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Being an early adopter of RMB in your treasury can help secure market share as competitors jostle for position in one of the world’s fastest-growing consumer markets.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, the evolution of RMB now represents an opportunity for companies to cut costs and improve financial flows. Ultimately, it may also be a way to start new business relationships and to tap a vast pool of aspiring customers. As Reyes comments, “that is no small achievement for a currency still new on the international stage”.</p>

A blank canvas,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Given the opportunity, not every treasurer would jump at the chance to set up a treasury from scratch. It requires different abilities than those in the day-to-day treasury skillset – including project management skills which the average treasurer doesn’t necessarily have. In addition, it usually involves much smaller companies than most treasurers would be accustomed to, admittedly ones that are growing either organically or through M&amp;A activity, or private equity/venture capitalist carve outs.</p>
<p>However, being involved in a greenfield project has many upsides. A treasurer can be seen to be ‘earning their stripes’ in the profession, effectively proving their mettle. A successful job proves that they have the ability to manage a complex project, have a thorough knowledge of treasury issues and can perform well under stress. Plus a greenfield site allows them to unleash their creativity and sculpt a department to their own specifications. That in itself may pique a treasurer’s interest.</p>
<p>For those that take the plunge, it can be a career-defining moment – although not necessarily a career-enhancer, according to Mark Adamson, Owner, Mark JD Adamson Ltd. He believes that it is easy to get pigeon-holed into either a “run-and-maintain” treasurer or a “get-it-done” project manager, and over time it becomes more difficult to cross back over to the other side.</p>
<p>But for Bas Rebel, Senior Director, Corporate Treasury Solutions, PricewaterhouseCoopers, building the European treasury centre from scratch for Perkin Elmer, a US multinational technology corporation, shaped his career and contributed to his professional success. “I think it is a career-defining project for a treasurer, especially today when treasury is at the crossroads of either remaining a tactical contributor or becoming a strategic value driver.”</p>
<p>Ever since the crisis in 2008, the CFO has prioritised cash visibility, getting a grip on cash flow and finding alternatives for bank funding – all of which are in the treasurer’s domain. “The new treasury should be a custodian for cash and risk, and to some extent compliance,” he says. “The treasurer who contributes to these areas makes a strategic contribution to the company. This brings them into working capital management and financing. They also have to define how to work with core businesses to make this happen. If you do it right, then the world is your oyster.”</p>

</blockquote>
<h3 id=""first-steps"">First steps</h3>
<p>It is hard to pinpoint the first step to take in building a treasury. Adamson’s advice is to get to the bottom as to the reason a new treasury is being set up. “This is not an insignificant event, as treasurers are senior individuals in organisations and do not come cheap. Hence, there must have been a trigger event – good or bad. I think that the first thing that the new treasurer has got to understand is what the trigger event was, which will tell reams about the new landscape and the tone of the organisation. I am not sure that this would necessarily come out in an interview process if they hired externally.”</p>
<p>He lists a few negative scenarios for implementing a new treasury, such as investors wanting more influence in the operational executive side of running the business as a result of a control incident, in addition to the more positive scenarios listed above. A new treasurer will need to dig beneath the surface to understand what has instigated their appointment.</p>
<p>This groundwork will also serve to understand what the culture of the treasury will be. Previously, the discussion was whether treasury was a cost or profit centre; however it is less of a black and white discussion today and must be done in collaboration with the directors and executives of the business.</p>
<p>The next step is to understand treasury’s remit and scope of activities. For example, at the larger company end of the scale, a treasurer might be responsible for investor relations, insurance and pension funds, as well as day-to-day treasury activities such as refinancing and managing currency exposures. In smaller organisations, treasury might only be responsible for cash management. However, some companies may include accounts receivable (AR), accounts payable (AP) and credit control – treasury can fill many gaps in a company’s requirements, as most treasurers know from experience.</p>
<p>As part of developing the target operating model and working out treasury’s remit, according to Karlien Porre, Treasury Advisory, Deloitte UK, the treasurer will also need to answer questions dealing with the size of the treasury team, the quality and level of people required, IT infrastructure, controls, etc. This is the time to ascertain whether the company has the in-house skills to run the project itself, or whether it needs to look for external support.</p>
<p>Developing treasury policy is the next hurdle. The treasury policy is a reflection of the company’s risk appetite and business objectives – for example is it looking to grow quickly or conserve existing assets? It is important to engage with the CFO, finance director and also tax and legal advisors, particularly if looking at jurisdictions outside of the home country. Tax and legal considerations are big drivers when deciding how to structure the treasury department, for example where to put staff and keep cash, and which entities to use for certain functions.</p>
<p>This should not prove to be too difficult, says Paul Stheeman, an Independent Treasury Consultant. “With a little bit of experience in using or writing policies, you can use the framework for what you are doing now,” he explains. He stresses the importance of being fully aware of the company’s overall risk appetite before beginning to draw up the policy.</p>
<p>A critical thing to keep in the back of your mind when creating treasury from scratch, according to PwC’s Rebel, is the question: what do you want to be when you grow up? “It is important to think in terms of where your company wants to be in five or six years’ time and plot what you need to do to get there. Don’t think too much about what your capabilities are today because you first have to align your strategic goals to the goals of the company. Only when you have defined the strategic targets/contribution of treasury, can you start plotting what type of expertise you need to have, what your policies have to entail and what functionality is needed to make that happen. It is a top-down approach: strategy, organisation, policies and then systems.”</p>
<p>Once treasury has defined a roadmap, it can then start discussing with management, subsidiaries and banks as to what they can do to help it reach its end goal. “Using this method you can pose open questions, rather than asking closed questions or squeezing out an extra penny. By describing what you are trying to accomplish, you will receive input from the other side of the table, which helps to identify value-driving opportunities that you may not have thought about before. In the end, you will build better relationships,” says Rebel.</p>

</blockquote>
<h3 id=""avoiding-implementation-pitfalls"">Avoiding implementation pitfalls</h3>
<p>The perils of implementing a new treasury is similar to other large projects, according to Deloitte’s Porre. The first is scope creep. “Although you start out with an initial plan outlining what treasury should cover, as time goes on your scope – whether operationally or systemically – gets expanded and delays or derails the project. Therefore, sticking to your defined scope is quite important.” Commitment of funding and resources, both quality and quantity, is an area which often causes delays in projects. Another pitfall is changes in the leadership or steering committee of senior management driving the project. The new management may not agree with past decisions, leading to a review which could change or delay a project.</p>
<p>Drilling down into more treasury-specific hurdles, Adamson argues that impatience can be an issue. “Directors have made a decision at a Board meeting that the company needs a treasurer, so they have gone through an extensive – and expensive – job search and recruitment process, and hired a treasurer. Monday morning when they turn up, the treasurer is at their desk and the directors relax, thinking that the job is done. The reality is that it has only just started. And, perhaps, it is worse than they think because the treasurer, with their specific skills, is going to perhaps find out more than the directors actually knew before.”</p>
<p>Through dialogue and relationship building, the treasurer plays an important role in ensuring other executives in the company understand that the implementation of a treasury or treasury solution is not an overnight activity. “They need to understand that they are starting a journey, there will probably be some mistakes along the way and it will take some time before the treasury department is in the desired state that the business needs it to be in. It depends on size of company but from walking in on a Monday morning to feeling that something controlled, secure and rational is in place is a two-year timeline,” says Adamson.</p>
<p>Brian Welch, Managing Director, UserCare Treasury Consultancy Limited, agrees that directors and the finance department might have heightened expectations as to what treasury can deliver immediately, but he adds that they also may not have any idea as to what to expect from treasury. Either way, there is usually a lot of education to be done from the outset.</p>
<p>Stheeman’s advice at this point is to be prepared for the unexpected. “You will often find that you are being caught wrong-footed, for example a bank may suddenly question credit lines; or you may have to settle an FX transaction when you don’t have sufficient records or settlement instructions; or someone signs off a payment without sufficient authority. At the beginning, you just don’t have the routine in place that you will have after a few months and therefore the unexpected is bound to hit you at some stage.”</p>
<h3 id=""implementing-best-practice"">Implementing best practice</h3>
<p>Despite each company – and the countries they operate in – exhibiting unique features, there is a far greater degree of best practice in treasury than everyone tends to believe, according to Rebel of PwC. But a treasurer must define best practice upfront in order to be able to aim for it. The extent to which best practice will be achieved is another thing. That is also dependent on external constraints (such as legislation, regulation, etc) as well as internal constraints (such as resources and budget).</p>
<p>This comes back to Rebel’s point about creating a roadmap. “Try to be bold and don’t assume that things are impossible. Once you have decided ‘what you want to be’, then you have a benchmark for a gap analysis. Any compromise will be transparent and documented. In addition, when you get into the territory where you have to make compromises, you come up with the right reasons why you want to make those compromises and you can explain it. But if you pick a point on the horizon with implicit assumptions about what is possible and what isn’t, then you will be challenged as to whether you have thought about this or that.”</p>
<p>By creating a roadmap treasurers also have a greater chance of making sure that the goal remains in place even when it isn’t immediately achieved. “It comes back to commitment to the initial scope and model. You shouldn’t stop striving for best practice when you have something up and running in six months to a years’ time, but should continue with the plan and improvements,” says Deloitte’s Porre.</p>
<p>It is so much easier to get a poor treasury function set up on the basis that it will be sorted out later, but Adamson believes that it is a false start. However, it takes a certain type of person to hold out for best practice. “It takes mental strength and stamina to implement best practice without compromising,” he says. “Maybe best practice implementation is painful, but if we want to do it we should do it now and not set up a compromise solution that is revisited and reworked in the weeks and months to come. It is possible to do but it takes a certain strength to do it – which doesn’t necessarily fit in with regular day-to-day treasury activities.”</p>
<p>Stheeman is more pragmatic. “In treasury you should have a vision about how the future treasury function will operate, which will include having appropriate policies in place and staff, but at the outset you are not likely to have either. You will have to move forward gradually. You should keep best practice as a goal but not make unrealistic expectations or shortcuts to a first-in-class treasury operation,” he explains.</p>
<h3 id=""measuring-success"">Measuring success</h3>
<p>Performance measurement is always difficult in treasury, according to Welch. Gone are the days of volatile interest rates when treasurers could benchmark their return on surplus cash. “Although we do try to identify benchmarks, it is one of the most difficult things in treasury, mainly because objectives can differ depending on the company,” he explains. For example, companies may have different ways of measuring foreign exchange (FX) achievement in terms of the impact of FX and foreign currency on their results.</p>
<p>When setting up a new treasury function, the action plan should include completion deadlines and relevant comments to each particular item, so that it is possible to regularly track progress. For example, a company may decide it wants to incorporate x% of its accounts into a cash management structure, then at the end of the year it can see whether it has captured x% of cash in the treasury centre, thereby minimising interest cost and optimising interest earned.</p>
<p>But Adamson believes that looking at just financial metrics jumps over an important dimension. “You should measure and record control incidents – or ‘near’ control incidents – which every business and treasury department has to differing degrees. This should be done on a ‘no blame’ basis, with lessons learnt, understood and disseminated. Therefore one measure of success is whether the number of control incidents has stabilised or gone down.”</p>
<p>The third important area is staffing engagement, which many treasurers ignore. “If you have come in as a new treasurer and your staff is turning over every six months, then that is a sure indication that it isn’t a nice place to work. You will have absolute chaos on your hands if you are constantly re-recruiting and retraining. This softer measure around staff turnover, training, knowledge and contentment is something that you need to think about. In my experience, with a good team of people you can achieve great things,” says Adamson.</p>

Treasurers get inventive,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The treasury teams of multinational corporations globally continue to be under great scrutiny and pressure as boards and C-level executives grapple with market volatility and economic uncertainty. The ability to bring back value to shareholders despite the turbulence in the marketplace is top of mind for business leaders, notes Carina Ruiz, Partner and National Leader, Treasury and Commodity Risk Management at Deloitte &amp; Touche. “As such, treasurers are under the gun to provide detailed analytics and perspectives on cash flow projections, repatriation strategies to support share buy-back and dividend programmes, and capital structure and funding options to sustain and fuel the business.”</p>
<p>The pressure is on and resources remain limited. Corporates are therefore looking inwards with a critical eye, determination and creativity in order to survive against the myriad challenges that continue to be presented to them.</p>
<h3 id=""alternative-thinking"">Alternative thinking</h3>
<p>Among the main hurdles that have – and will have – an impact on a corporate’s bottom line are the current monetary policies of the governments, according to Sigurd Dahrendorf, Vice President Corporate Treasury at Knorr-Bremse. “For example, the European Central Bank (ECB) is trying to fight against the financial crisis by printing money. This is necessary in the short term, but it could actually be dangerous long term – I think it has a hidden impact on the value of the currency,” he warns.</p>
<p>Although a Europe-based company, Dahrendorf ensures that Knorr Brense holds large portions of its cash in currencies other than euro in order to mitigate this potential depression. “Companies need to look at the cash they have on hand on a regular basis and ensure that it is well spread between a number of different currencies, ideally those they are generating cash flows from.”</p>
<p>Stéphane Aubin, Treasury Manager at the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), also cites issues of information – and gaining access to information – as playing a large part in the current global financial difficulties. He foresees this being a challenge for quite some time. “There are numerous challenges around obtaining information, either externally or internally, therefore treasurers need a better source from which to glean an accurate feed.”</p>
<p>As such, Aubin asserts that the solution is to access and compile this data both internally and externally – and on an immediate, real-time basis. “From a treasury perspective, the department always needs to have a transparent, accurate view of company cash and must shorten the time it takes to get a consolidation overview. What was manually done on a daily basis may have been acceptable a few years ago but now needs to be automated where possible.”</p>
<p>While many regional treasuries are still prioritising debt management as available funds are considerably stretched, Bruno Lawaree, Senior Treasury Manager EMEA at Eaton Corporation, reports that there are also a significant amount of companies that are placing their main focus on analysing existing treasury operations and seeking best practice in these processes. Some of these activities include “much more of an emphasis on pooling cash and building strong processes to manage credit risk on our investments. On the foreign exchange (FX) side, treasurers are looking to build robust methodology for the timely assessment of exposures and establish effective consolidation methods, in order to minimise the volume of errors in external trades.”</p>
<h3 id=""centres-of-excellence"">Centres of excellence</h3>
<p>Before the economic downturn several years ago, most treasury organisations were fighting a losing battle when it came to requesting funds from their company Board in order to improve operations through automation and organisational changes, according to Ruiz. “Treasury was purely seen as a cost centre and would typically be subject to cost reduction exercises related to outsourcing activities to shared service centres (SSCs) or downsizing.”</p>
<p>When the financial crisis hit, however, the importance of the role of the treasurer became glaringly apparent and it was realised that the lack of investment in treasury departments left most companies completely unprepared to handle the series of drastic market events that would follow. In this context, the evolution of treasury organisations has been measured, says Ruiz. “The trend has been for treasury groups to first focus on automating manual processes through treasury technology solutions to free up resources. Once completed, they typically turn to moving up the treasury operating maturity model and seek to establish centres of excellence in FX, liquidity management, banking and risk management – that is, components of in-house banks.”</p>
<p>Ruiz adds that a more sophisticated and integrated ERP solution needs to be in place before all aspects of an in-house bank can be implemented, including global liquidity pools, a payment factory and a collections factory. But working on integrating and improving aggregation of all sources (TMS, ERP and non-financial data) is close to the heart of the innovative modern treasurer, says Aubin, who is currently placing a lot of energy into having in-house systems integrated in an efficient manner. “We need to integrate the data from these sources in such a way that we can extrapolate an accurate forecast. This is again where we need near real-time information.”</p>
<p>The EBU is now working on the implementation of the SWIFT network to allow better access to banks for its subsidiaries, according to Aubin. But regardless of what each company has achieved thus far, the drive to constantly improve processes, systems and infrastructure is clearly apparent across the landscape, borne from a need to survive and adapt in a difficult economic and competitive era. In this respect, Dahrendorf sees the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) as a very reasonable and welcome development because it makes the payment exchange in Europe much easier, more convenient and perhaps most importantly, cheaper for companies. “Our own company has almost finished our approach to this – we are prepared and essentially SEPA-ready. But what we are now looking at is what others should also address – the fact that there may be establishments outside the SEPA zone, under our company remit, which are also transacting in euros.”</p>
<p>“If they are handling in euros, they have to fulfil the same requirements as any company in the SEPA zone. The majority of companies are only looking at the subsidiaries that are located within the SEPA zone but if you have a company in China that deals a reasonable part of its business in euro, then they have to ensure that payments still reach the beneficiary effectively after the introduction of SEPA,” he warns.</p>
<h3 id=""strengthening-the-supply-chain"">Strengthening the supply chain</h3>
<p>In an effort to optimise internal processes, treasurers are also acutely aware of external influences that must be appropriately addressed and managed. For many companies, the biggest sustainability risks they face are embedded in the supply chain. Tied to this process are various treasury-specific metrics – for example, reduction in working capital and reduction in cost of funds – as well as broader finance goals, such as reduction in the cash conversion cycle and improvement of accounts payable (AP) and accounts receivable (AR) terms, inventory and cyclical cash flow.</p>
<p>Ruiz recognises that maximising working capital is not exactly a new concept but believes that the function has grown and improved. “While the method itself may not be novel, I find that CFOs are trending towards giving treasurers greater responsibility for governance over working capital in general. In response, treasurers are seeking to utilise their own cash flow forecasting process and marry this as much as possible with budget and forecasting models to be able to provide independent views to the CFO on opportunities to improve and reduce working capital overall.”</p>
<p>Indeed, supply chain finance (SCF) is an area in which Knorr-Bremse as a company has focused on for almost six years. Dahrendorf and his team, in partnership with Deutsche Bank in 2008, developed one of the very first finance supply chain (FSC) programmes, an initiative that merited an Adam Smith Award in 2009. This is still such a relevant theme, especially in terms of liquidity, says Dahrendorf. “If you look at the fact that many companies have been newly assessed in terms of their ratings by the banks and as a result are sometimes rated worse than before, their credit facilities may be negatively affected. If that happens with supply chain finance, they may get the opportunity to turn to customers such as ourselves to improve their liquidity by participating in a relevant programme which we can offer them. Since they are practically selling AR to the bank, we are actually lending our rating to these suppliers.</p>
<p>“Some companies that were extremely reluctant to take part in a supply chain programme initially have suddenly become interested. They realise that this finance structure is basically the same as factoring. The crucial difference to factoring, however, is that some of the cost/risk components of a normal factoring programme are excluded and that makes it very attractive for companies. The extension of SCF solutions is a very important tool – not only now but also for the coming years – to stabilise especially smaller suppliers and optimise our own working capital structure.”</p>
<p>Lawaree too acknowledges a change in tactics across the industry in recent times, a growing understanding that working with treasury at an early stage and being upfront in order to optimise supply chain structures can be hugely beneficial for all concerned. “We have seen over the past years, both in the structure of treasury department and also in the interactions with external operations an evolution, a move towards a much more dynamic and proactive approach in working capital management processes.”</p>
<h3 id=""innovation-meets-technology"">Innovation meets technology</h3>
<p>When the treasury function was highlighted as having such a central role to play in the survival and the development of the corporate, the technology providers and banks launched a tsunami of product releases, solutions that would enable the corporate treasurer to do their job better – and more easily.</p>
<p>Companies of all sizes are either implementing or are looking to implement some form of treasury technology solution to automate tactical treasury processes, according to Ruiz. “Whereas before, companies under $5 billion in revenues would usually rely on manual processes and a series of banking platforms to operate treasury day-to-day, web-enabled cash management-focused treasury workstation solutions have flourished in this space to offer cost-effective and relatively more easily implementable solutions.”</p>
<p>A rapidly advancing industry, Lawaree says that the choice of available products is a welcome one. “Everything that can help treasury to increase automation and controls is appreciated. New regulations plus the need to absorb more and more data is driving our strategy and projects.”</p>
<p>Eaton Corporation is also looking at options for an in-house system that will incorporate cloud services as it is an area, says Lawaree, which has seen mass adoption – and created great benefits – across the corporate system landscape. Aubin, for instance, uses a TMS in his treasury which is cloud-based and cites many advantages of the platform, not least the fact that his team do not have to rely on IT support. However, he does add: “the bad side is that typically for customisation and integration with other systems, you have to somehow rely on the existing features or it means additional costs. While we enjoy using the application for TMS and cash management and so on, it does have its limitations.”</p>
<p>Nonetheless, ultimately the trend is to essentially tap into creativity and find very innovative solutions in order to make sure that the corporate is always well financed and has enough access to cash, according to Dahrendorf, concluding: “there is no way that one size fits all. Every treasurer has to adjust; with the tool box that is available, they must find a solution that is appropriate for their company.”</p>

<h3 id=""the-regulation-wall"">The regulation wall</h3>
<p>Corporates, too, have boundaries – perhaps not to their innovation or creativity – but there are some aspects of the current environment that treasurers may not be able to tackle themselves. The regulatory backlash – that continues to rage on – from the economic slump is one such area. Many market participants believe that a large portion of these rules and guidelines were made in haste and used as a ‘comfort blanket’ to assuage fears of double (or triple) dip with no real consideration for the damage it could have on already suffering corporates.</p>
<p>This is a challenge for medium-sized companies, according to Dahrendorf. “In Germany, for example, are many mid cap companies that are generally not very well equipped with risk management and IT systems to administer their FX deals and so on. But they are also required to do the same thing as the larger corporates if they go beyond the thresholds and for them this is really a challenge.”</p>
<p>Dahrendorf gives us the example of the introduction of European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) to highlight his point. On 4<sup>th</sup> July 2012, the regulation on over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories was adopted and it entered into force on 16<sup>th</sup> August 2012. According to the European Commission, the aim of this legislation is “to ensure that all European derivative transactions will be reported to trade repositories and be accessible to supervisory authorities, including the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), to give policymakers and supervisors a clear overview of what is going on in the markets.”</p>
<p>Dahrendorf accepts that that the fundamental concept of the legislation is relevant enough but cannot fathom why the regulators have decided to extend that small to medium-sized producing companies. “The administrative burden is in no reasonable relation to the risks involved. For banks, it is an acceptable request as it is part of their business model to speculate FX deals; but mid-cap companies, where FX business is just for hedging in order to keep the company cash free from negative currency impacts, are suffering.”</p>
<p>Corporates are not capable of managing this, according to Dahrendorf. They have to implement bigger projects to fulfil the requirements. Also larger companies, such as Knorr-Bremse, have decided to implement projects to deal with these new regulations and facilitate their implementation into their daily business. “Essentially we need the help of consultants for this, as we feel that this is too sophisticated and too complicated with too many traps along the way.”</p>

<h5 id=""gerard-gallagher-advisory-services-markets-leader-ernst-and-young"">Gerard Gallagher, Advisory Services Markets Leader, Ernst &amp; Young:</h5>
<p>The very first thing is prioritisation of resources. Clients across all sectors are really challenging themselves about where they are spending their money. The level of rigour around investment and return on investment has been at the highest that I have ever seen.</p>
<p>We saw so many business cases in the past, particularly in commodities sectors such as oil and gas, and metals, where commodity prices used to be the saviour. In the last 20 years prices have only gone in one direction, but in the past two years they have begun to move in the other direction. Now, all of a sudden, the operational effectiveness of many of these companies has been drawn out, in a way that is challenging them. So they are now starting to worry about business cases and investments. I would say therefore that the very first thing that people looking to invest in emerging markets, or indeed in new offerings, should do, is to start to rationalise and prioritise their existing resources.</p>
<p>The second point concerns operational efficiency. Organisations are saving money by centralising resources and bringing processes together to fund these new areas.</p>
<p>A third key trend, particularly around the faster growing markets, is that people are increasingly looking to form partnerships. Many organisations are entering into joint ventures where they can add value and get access to that market other than just cash – so they can bring intellectual property, bring skills and resource innovation. In emerging markets it’s not just a case of how much money you’ve got, but what other resources you have available as an organisation to deliver in those markets. You need more than just money to be successful.</p>
<p>And finally, from a treasury perspective, one of the biggest challenges I hear of when I speak to treasurers of companies operating in emerging markets is working capital and cash management. Do not go into an emerging market or a fast-growth market expecting the same working capital management processes and timescales that you may be used to in the more mature and established markets. That is not going to be the case.</p>
<p>My key message is, challenge where you are spending your money at the moment and get on with those good things that you need to be doing around operational efficiency. An average organisation can save up to 10%-12% just by doing that and recycle that money into emerging markets. Think about other resources that you have in your organisation that you can use to fund that expansion – IT and other non-cash resources. And finally, watch out for your working capital and your cash flow.</p>

<h5 id=""dr-murat-ulgen-chief-economist-for-central-and-eastern-europe-and-sub-saharan-africa-hsbc"">Dr Murat Ulgen, Chief Economist for Central and Eastern Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa, HSBC:</h5>
<p>Emerging markets, led by Asia, in particular China, have become the driving force of global growth as the economic prospects of the developed world are still marred by structural problems. As such, the notion of the ‘emerging market’ has itself been questioned. While this might be an endless debate, one thing is clear, emerging markets still need a significant amount of investment in infrastructure, both in human and physical capital. It is important to note that the growth potential of a country can be boosted by investments into productivity-enhancing areas, in addition to bringing more people into active economic life. These investments, by definition, should be long term in nature. Hence, the best way to fund growth in emerging markets is to fund such long-term investments that would deliver a highly-skilled labour force in the future.</p>
<p>The source of such funding is also crucial. These investments could be financed by domestic savings and/or external capital. More importantly than the origin, such investments require a stable source of funding. Emerging markets span a very wide range of countries. Some rely heavily on domestic savings, such as those in Asia, others predominantly on foreign funding, like those in Central and Eastern Europe. The latter presents a risk in today’s highly-integrated global markets when a sharp decline in investor confidence might lead to a pull-back of external financing, thereby hampering investments in those countries that rely too much on foreign funding. On the other hand, depending excessively on domestic savings poses other problems such as imbalanced growth that relies too much on investments, a decline in the return on capital, excessive reserve build-up and domestic asset bubble, to name a few. Therefore, it is important for an emerging market country to strike a delicate balance between domestic and foreign savings to finance growth, provided that these are long term and stable sources of funding.</p>
<p>Emerging markets should draw a lesson from the past mistakes of the developed world. They should not engage in a swift build-up in debt, even though borrowing terms may look very favourable nowadays thanks to ample global liquidity. That said, access to cheap global capital should be welcome so long as it generates higher productivity, sustainable economic growth and income and wealth that expand at a faster pace than indebtedness.</p>
<figure class=""portrait right""><img alt=""Portrait of Mahesh Kini"" height=""150"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2013/02/2013-02-tt-01-qa-mahesh-kini-100x150.jpg"" width=""100""/></figure>
<h5 id=""mahesh-kini-regional-head-of-cash-management-for-corporates-asia-pacific-global-transaction-banking-at-deutsche-bank"">Mahesh Kini, Regional Head of Cash Management for Corporates – Asia Pacific, Global Transaction Banking at Deutsche Bank:</h5>
<p>When companies in Asia are looking to fund growth, they have – generally speaking – three options. These are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Utilising cash to the best extent possible within their company;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimising cash across the wider organisation – including sister or parent companies, for example; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tapping into capital markets or bank financing to raise funds. However, when we look at the emerging markets more closely, it becomes clear that the methods of combining and optimising these three options differ from those in the developed markets. This is primarily due to the varying regulatory frameworks that are in place throughout the emerging markets. While most are making significant progress towards easing monetary constraints, issuing changes to transactional policies is not always in their immediate plans.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If choosing the first and second options – utilising cash within an entity and throughout the wider organisation – corporates with operations in emerging markets may face the added complexity of having considerable balances dispersed across various international/local banks and accounts. Companies that find themselves in this situation may wish to consider consolidating these balances, which could prove to be a substantial and relatively inexpensive source of capital. The many liquidity management options available today can be of great benefit to these organisations.</p>
<p>Given that traditional cash sweeping or pooling may not always be possible in emerging markets, banks like Deutsche Bank can help corporates achieve the same goals with alternative solutions, such as standard and advanced group entrustment loan options in China, or nostro collection solutions in Korea, that enable corporates to consolidate bank relationships and reduce the number of bank accounts they hold. In Thailand or Indonesia, corporates may wish to consider multi-bank cash sweeping, which allows them to benefit from a daily cash sweep from their local bank accounts to a single, consolidated master account. Solutions such as this can help corporate treasurers consolidate ‘trapped’ balances, which in turn can be easily deployed to fund future growth initiatives.</p>
<p>As for the third option, companies may choose to fund emerging market growth by accessing the capital markets either in developed economies, or the emerging markets themselves. However, as some degree of complexity – as well as higher fees and financing costs – is inherent to this choice, it usually comes as part of a company’s broader development strategy.</p>
<p>Clearly, one size does not fit all when it comes to funding growth in the emerging markets. The optimal solution will differ from company to company based on corporate profile and strategy. Banks with notable emerging market experience are best-placed to offer advice on the most appropriate cash optimisation solutions, the majority of which are likely to begin with methods of maximising cash internally before reaching out to the wider financial/capital markets as alternative sources of funding.</p>

Treasury in the healthcare sector: relieving the headache,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>In this Sector Profile we look at the challenges and opportunities in the healthcare sector today – from patent expiries and generic competition eroding the value chain, to funding the M&amp;A frenzy. We also examine ways in which the treasurer can add real value to the company, whether it be through strategic financing or improved internal communication.</em></p>
<p>One of the most diverse industry sectors, ‘healthcare’ encompasses everything from pharmaceuticals to MedTech companies and continuing care names, including private hospital groups. Western economies remain the leaders in the healthcare industry, with healthcare spending in most developed economies representing at least 9% of total GDP.</p>
<p>Generally viewed by investors as ‘defensive’ play, the healthcare sector navigated the financial crisis relatively well. Although revenues have dipped slightly from the 6-7% CAGR seen pre-crisis, healthcare companies are, by and large, bolstered by solid fundamentals and some positive headwinds.</p>
<p>“Pharmaceuticals in particular continue to generate sufficient cash to support their operations and expansion plans,” says Carlos Lopez, Director, Global Healthcare Coverage at Lloyds Bank Wholesale Banking &amp; Markets. “Most of the major players have very good credit metrics; they also have ample capacity to absorb more debt to fund acquisitions. In addition, they have reliable and loyal banking groups. So really there are a lot of factors in their favour.”</p>
<p>Overarching trends, such as the ageing global population, obesity and diabetes epidemics, the growth of the middle classes in emerging economies and innovative technologies also point to the long-term sustainability of the healthcare sector. “Over the next 30 years, changing demographics will most definitely be a pillar of support for healthcare,” agrees Lopez. “In the short term however, the industry faces a number of obstacles.”</p>
<h3 id=""the-patent-cliff"">The patent cliff</h3>
<p>A widely publicised challenge facing the pharmaceuticals sector is the ‘patent cliff’. For the last 25 years, the pharmaceuticals industry has been focused on driving revenue through the research and development (R&amp;D) of a range of drugs. “What has been happening since the mid-2000s is that most of the major players in the industry have relied on just one or two drugs per company from a revenue and income point of view, whilst continuing to materialise their pipeline,” explains Lopez. “These drugs are patent protected for a given time and once the patent expires, then generic companies enter the market with the same drug, but significantly cheaper. It just so happens that we are approaching a period when a number of ‘blockbuster’ drugs will be coming out of their patent protection, hence the ‘cliff’ analogy.”</p>
<p>Pfizer’s Lipitor, the top-selling cholesterol drug, suffered patent expiry in November 2011. At the beginning of May 2012, the company reported a 19% drop in net earnings in its Q1 results. The fall from $2.2 billion to $1.79 billion was attributed in large part to Lipitor losing its patent exclusivity. The company also had a handful of other patents expiring around the same time, including those on Xalatan (for glaucoma) and Geodon (for bipolar disorder). Bristol-Myers Squibb Sanofi’s Plavix, a blood thinner and the world’s best-selling medicine, also lost its patent protection recently. Like many other players, the company is expecting a sharp drop in revenue (approximately $8 billion) from that product alone. In fact, estimates suggest that across the industry, in the region of $70 billion of income is currently in jeopardy from patent expiries.</p>
<h3 id=""government-austerity-measures-and-generics-impacting-the-value-chain"">Government austerity measures and generics impacting the value chain</h3>
<p>What tended to happen before Lipitor – which Pfizer is still marketing under its brand name and selling directly to patients – is that when the drug patent expired, the branded pharmaceutical either stopped making it or sold the rights to another company. The generic pharmaceutical companies then bring that drug to market at a much reduced price. They are able to do this as they have not invested in the R&amp;D for the product. However, even the generic companies are coming under pressure, as Lopez explains:</p>
<p>“With the troubles in the Eurozone, countries are starting to feel the pinch on their balance sheets. This means that austerity measures are being put in place. Spending is being cut and naturally healthcare budgets are under extremely close scrutiny. This is an incentive for governments to work on bringing cheaper drugs into the system. Since they control the licences, they are able to control the price of the generics through the use of caps.”</p>
<p>“In turn this is making it difficult for the generic companies to make a margin. Governments are therefore going to have to look again at caps and think about the absolute minimum level at which things can work effectively. This may revolve around determining the price of each drug based on its clinical benefits and value – but that will of course be difficult to implement. Things are very different in the US, for example, where the healthcare system is not so heavily subsidised and distributors tend to have a little more pricing power.”</p>
<p>An additional concern in Europe is that government balance sheets are only going to become more stretched. Greece must continue to support its healthcare system but the majority of providers will have a question mark over how/whether they will be paid. “It’s going to be a very fine line between what’s morally right as a pharmaceutical company and what’s in the best interests of your shareholders,” warns Lopez.</p>
<h3 id=""biosimilars-loom-on-the-horizon"">Biosimilars loom on the horizon</h3>
<p>It is not only the big branded pharmaceuticals and generics that are feeling the pain though. Speciality pharmaceuticals are also facing their own challenges. These speciality pharmaceuticals deal mainly with rare diseases and their manufacturing processes are very different from those of their branded counterparts: a branded pharmaceutical tends to mix compounds via a synthetic process, whereas a specialist pharmaceutical company tends to produce drugs through a biotechnology process.</p>
<p>These ‘biologic’ drugs are also subject to patents – and therefore the dangers of patent expiry. At the moment, however, they continue to have exclusivity because of a lack of competition. But according to Lopez, “it’s not a question of if generic speciality drugs, or ‘biosimilars’, will come to the market, but when. Since the population that the speciality drugs are aimed at is significantly lower, producing a generic form will require a massive investment by the existing generic pharmaceuticals. However, there will no doubt be oncology or diabetes drugs that appeal to the generic manufacturers. What this means is that in the not too distant future the speciality pharmaceuticals will have exactly the same problems as the branded ones are facing now.”</p>

<p>Faced with these challenges, what are healthcare companies to do to ensure growth? “Essentially, everything that can happen is happening in the space right now,” says Lopez. The pharmaceuticals sub sector as a whole has gone through a significant amount of change and a large degree of cost cutting, restructuring and, most notably, consolidation has resulted from that.</p>
<p>“We have seen branded drugs companies buying up other branded drugs companies, or specialty pharmaceuticals companies and in some instances they have bought generic companies too. Certain players have even branched out into areas such as consumer and animal health.”</p>
<p>Recent activity in the M&amp;A space has included:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>AstraZeneca buying Ardea for $1 billion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watson Pharmaceuticals agreeing to buy Actavis, a European generic company, for $5.6 billion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nestlé purchasing Pfizer’s infant nutritional business for $12 billion.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There have also been some unsuccessful bids, such as Glaxo’s attempt to purchase Human Genome Sciences for $2.6 billion (still ongoing). Roche also abandoned its hostile $6 billion takeover bid for Illumina, a gene sequencing firm.</p>
<p>“The main driver for consolidation continues to be that the pharmaceuticals are trying to replace some of the revenue that will be lost when the patents of their blockbuster drugs expire. Of course, there are still plenty of new drug applications that are being filed with the regulators but R&amp;D is becoming very expensive due to the arduous regulatory approval process. This consists of several different phases and it can take up to ten years to see any return on investment. The process of acquiring innovation by buying a single drug company and bringing their product to market is therefore increasingly appealing. The industry calls this cheaper route ‘search and development’.”</p>
<h3 id=""the-role-of-the-treasurer"">The role of the treasurer</h3>
<p>Funding M&amp;A transactions is dependent on the company’s own specific circumstances and where they are in their business cycle. However, a number of the large pharmaceuticals have cash available and good credit profiles, making the process a little easier. Nevertheless, the credit crisis left a lasting impact on the industry and how it conducts its deals, while also highlighting the importance of having a strong, reliable banking group in place.</p>
<p>“Before the credit crisis, you could identify a target, agree the purchase price or T&amp;Cs with the target and then worry about the financing. Changes to the UK Takeover Code, coupled with the current market conditions mean that conversations with the financing banks happen much sooner now. This is because you need certainty of funding early in the M&amp;A process,” Lopez notes.</p>
<p>In addition, Lopez is also seeing an increased level of dialogue taking place around structuring and financing the acquisition successfully considering the state of the capital markets. This could be around capital structure, foreign exchange risk or interest rate risk, for example, and how those are best managed. So the bank is playing much more of a debt and risk management advisory role today, making the most of relationships and sharing knowledge.</p>
<p>“At Lloyds Bank, we take a very active role in the financing of an acquisition – from inception all the way through to the ‘sell down’ to the various markets. We also look at the management of any risks that arise from the transaction itself. This is something the bank has been doing for a number of years, but the discussions are happening much earlier in the M&amp;A cycle now.”</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p>Given the sheer size of some of the M&amp;A deals in the healthcare sector, borrowers need to look at multiple markets in which to raise capital. Carlos Lopez and Rovert Greene from Lloyds Bank explain the bank’s capabilities in helping global pharma companies find alternative funding.</p>
<h5 id=""what-qualifies-lloyds-bank-to-look-after-clients-in-the-healthcare-sector"">What qualifies Lloyds Bank to look after clients in the healthcare sector?</h5>

<p><span>CL:</span> As a relationship-focused bank with extensive healthcare knowledge, we take the time to understand the issues that our clients face. The concept of the ‘one stop shop’ bank was never one that Lloyds Bank embraced – we have specific areas of expertise and we have been very prescriptive in determining which industry sectors the bank wants to support. Healthcare is an extremely important focus for Lloyds Bank and we have a complete offering, from sector specialists through to debt capital market, risk and FX specialists, as well as a full suite of tailored solutions.</p>
<p>Of course we are involved in the financing of M&amp;A deals for our healthcare clients but there are financial requirements in the normal course of business that we help clients with too. This could be selling a subsidiary or undertaking a large scale project. Such activity will give rise to the same questions around FX risk, interest rate risk or in some cases commodity risk. Also, some companies will need to take on more debt to complete these projects. We can assist them in analysing the optimum level of debt and what the ideal fixed/floating rate ratio would be for them. This all forms part of the solutions-based approach that we offer our clients.</p>
<p>Moreover, because of the position that we have in Europe and the number of hospitals that we work with as clients, this actually gives us a very good insight into the end-users of pharmaceuticals and medical technology. In turn, this helps us to have in-depth conversations with our healthcare clients and identify key trends in the sector. So, more than just offering financial capital, we are able to offer intellectual capital to help our clients strategically.</p>

<h5 id=""how-are-clients-using-the-debt-capital-markets-dcm-to-raise-capital-at-the-moment-also-what-capabilities-does-lloyds-bank-offer-in-the-dcm-space"">How are clients using the debt capital markets (DCM) to raise capital at the moment? Also, what capabilities does Lloyds Bank offer in the DCM space?</h5>

<p><span>RG:</span> A key responsibility of treasurers is to ensure liquidity and provide access to capital at times of need or opportunity. The current iteration of the financial crisis reinforces the view that taking advantage of markets when they are open is prudent. Whilst only 10% of corporate borrowing in the US comes from banks, it is 70% in the Eurozone and the UK. However it is arguable that many of Europe’s banks are in a much weaker state than their US counterparts. As a result, many conservative corporates here are shifting the balance of bond and loan debt in their capital structures. European loan volume is down 49%, year-on-year. In contrast, European corporates raised a record 61% of all of their loan and bond refinancings in the bond market.</p>
<p>At Lloyds Bank, we provide a broad range of debt and risk management solutions. Augmenting our leading loan markets business we have a complete DCM offering for our customers across the public bond markets, primarily in Europe. The bank has a growing capability in the US dollar market through our broker-dealer business, Lloyds Securities Inc. We also have an experienced US-based private placement team, further enhancing our solutions offering, largely to enable access to the capital markets for unrated issuers.</p>
<p>Lloyds Bank is currently the number one bookrunner for UK corporate issuers in the Sterling and Euro bond markets combined. So far in 2012 alone we have been the boookrunner on around £20 billion equivalent of issuance for our corporate customers in the European bond markets.</p>
<p>Looking specifically at the global pharma companies, they tend to raise capital in the US dollar bond market. In fact, since the credit crunch, 80% of all debt raised by these groups has been in US dollars, with 18% in Euros and 2% in sterling. That activity totalled more than $300 billion since 2008, so it’s an extremely deep and liquid market. Given the sheer size of some of the M&amp;A deals in this sector though, take for example Roche’s acquisition of Genentech and Pfizer’s acquisition of Wyeth in 2009, borrowers need to look at multiple markets. Those two deals between them saw $25 billion equivalent raised. Since no single market would have been able to provide that amount in the short term, it was termed out into a variety of different bond markets, including sterling and euros, which also offer diversification, flexibility in duration and from time-to-time, pricing advantages.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the economic backdrop, corporate bonds really do remain the asset class of choice for credit investors today. Issuance is however at a relatively low level, owing to companies reigning back M&amp;A and investment expenditure, leading to a demand/supply imbalance. This, combined with historically low government yields, makes corporate bonds an even more attractive liquidity tool for the treasurer, with coupons at all-time low levels and the potential for huge oversubscriptions.</p>

<h5 id=""fx-risk-is-a-significant-challenge-for-many-healthcare-companies-what-tools-does-lloyds-bank-have-available-to-help-clients-manage-and-mitigate-this"">FX risk is a significant challenge for many healthcare companies. What tools does Lloyds Bank have available to help clients manage and mitigate this?</h5>

<p><span>CL:</span> In September 2011, we launched our latest FX offering for clients: Arena. It is an e-trading platform with a holistic attitude. In addition to FX and money market deal execution, the platform provides access to a wealth of Lloyds Bank information, including proprietary economic research, market commentary, interactive charting and risk analytic toolkits. Reputable market data and live news are also being provided from well-known third-party sources.</p>
<p>We recognise that in catering for the banks’ diverse client sectors, it is important to offer functionalities that will suit each of these. As such, we held consultative workshops with clients from a range of industry sectors to help identify their different needs and priorities when developing Arena. Cash management capabilities are being rolled out across the platform this year, giving the treasurer even greater visibility over their holdings and exposures.</p>
<p>While technical, economic and risk tools are available on the platform, clients can also use interactive chat functionalities to speak with Lloyds Bank’s experts, or simply pick up the phone to discuss risk management challenges or structuring techniques, for example.</p>

<h5 id=""finally-how-have-clients-views-on-bank-counterparty-risk-changed-in-the-healthcare-sector"">Finally, how have clients’ views on bank counterparty risk changed in the healthcare sector?</h5>

<p><span>CL:</span> The credit metrics for the banks are constantly being reassessed and therefore companies – in all sectors, not just healthcare – are very aware of bank counterparty risk today. We are seeing clients actively re-evaluating their banking groups and looking to keep their relationships with banking partners that offer them more than just products. Equally, where companies have excess cash, as many of the pharmaceuticals do, investment policies are being revisited and rewritten, with much attention being paid to the concentration of deposits.</p>


<h3 id=""adding-value-to-the-company"">Adding value to the company</h3>
<p>Another interesting sector trend that Lopez has observed is the increasingly strategic role of the treasurer. “Treasurers operating in the pharmaceuticals space have always been conscious of the fact that their sales are dependent on clients being able to buy their product. But the crisis in Europe has changed this from a thought in the back of their minds to a plan for ensuring revenue sustainability.” In other words, treasurers are becoming far more engaged with the ‘front line’ of the company.</p>
<p>They are gathering data on what customers are thinking, what their buying behaviour or patterns are, and how they are shifting. How to recognise sales as quickly as possible is another key area of focus here as treasurers consider the extent to which financing the company’s customers would be beneficial.</p>
<p>“In those dialogues, banks such as Lloyds Bank can come in and propose solutions which would allow the end-users (ie hospitals) to continue paying in instalments for example and allow the pharmaceuticals or medical equipment company to recognise its sales from day one,” says Lopez. “Lloyds Bank has a great deal of experience in this area. We can recommend financing strategies that not only overcome an immediate challenge but that look to support the growth strategy of the corporate and add value over the long term.”</p>
<h3 id=""lloyds-bank-wholesale-banking-and-markets"">Lloyds Bank Wholesale Banking &amp; Markets</h3>
<p>Lloyds Bank, part of the Wholesale division at Lloyds Banking Group, provides comprehensive expert financial services to businesses, from those with over £15m annual turnover to those with turnover in the billions. It has over 26,000 corporate clients, ranging from privately-owned firms to FTSE 100 PLCs, multinational corporations and financial institutions.</p>
<p>It has a network of relationship teams across the UK, as well as internationally, with the mix of local understanding and global expertise necessary to provide long-term support and advice to its customers.</p>
<p>Lloyds Bank offers a broad range of finance, spanning structured and asset finance, import and export trade finance; securitisation facilities and capital market funding. Its product specialists provide bespoke financial services and solutions including tailored cash management, international trade, treasury and risk management services.</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>It is well known that corporate treasury models, strategies and challenges vary between industry sectors. Running a treasury operation in a regulated entity – such as a stockbroker or pension administrator – however entails a number of significant hurdles that other treasurers are exempt from.</p>
<p>Not only do treasury professionals in such entities have to think about the regulations that are affecting the wider treasury community, there are also specific regulations and requirements they must adhere to. These largely revolve around liquidity and the appropriate safeguarding of client money. Failing to comply can result in significant financial penalties – the last thing any treasurer wants to build in to their cash flow forecast.</p>
<p>Treasury professionals working for a regulated entity will also have a large amount of due diligence to perform when it comes to deposits. After all, such entities are not simply in charge of the company’s money, but their clients’ money too.</p>
<p>Indeed, regulated entities which manage client funds are coming under increasing regulatory scrutiny with regard to mitigating concentration risk and ensuring appropriate separation between client money and the firm’s money.</p>
<p>Lloyds Bank recognises that its corporate customers need to undertake regular due diligence on their counterparty banks,” says Robert Hare, Head of Specialist Banking, Lloyds Bank. “As such, we provide regular, detailed financial information on Lloyds Banking Group to help them to formulate and review their counterparty risk strategy. This greatly assists our customers, keeping them informed during these uncertain times.”</p>
<p>Hare also stresses the fact that Lloyds Banking Group has the UK’s largest retail branch network. It serves over 1m businesses and holds over £400 billion in customer deposits.</p>
<p>Moreover, the bank’s recently published annual results for 2011 show that it has an improved tier 1 capital ratio (10.8%), and an improved funding position – all of which has meant that wholesale funding has been reduced by £251 billion and substantial non-core assets have been reduced by £53 billion. The bank also has the lowest European sovereign debt exposure in its peer group – its total exposure to Greece, for example, stands at £500m.</p>
<p>“If you look at the strength of the UK’s sovereign rating and the fact that Lloyds Bank is a UK-centric bank that doesn’t have a big investment arm, we don’t expect to face the challenges down the line that some of our competitors do. Couple that with our strong core tier capital ratios and our cutting back on wholesale financing and we are well positioned to face the challenges as they arise,” says Hare.</p>
<p>“Nevertheless, we are also realistic and we recognise that security of funds is a concern in the market for clients wishing to place deposits,” says Hare. “Bank of Scotland and Lloyds TSB Bank Plc operate under separate banking licences as part of Lloyds Banking Group and as such any deposits held are covered separately under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS),” he explains.</p>
<p>Deposits with either bank held under each banking licence therefore benefit from FSCS cover of £85,000 (£170,000 for joint accounts) per underlying client.</p>
<h3 id=""expertise-and-intellectual-capital"">Expertise and intellectual capital</h3>
<p>Away from these black and white figures and facts, Lloyds adds colour to its regulated entity proposition through its team of sector experts. The bank’s dedicated Client Banking team – that today manages a large number of accounts on behalf of clients and controls pension fund cash for their customers – was formed in the 1990s.</p>
<p>It was initially charged with helping stockbrokers who had to manage clients’ funds following the introduction of rolling settlement for stock exchange transactions. Over two decades later, the team continues to meet the needs of its deposit customers.</p>
<h3 id=""spotlight-on-client-banking"">Spotlight on Client Banking</h3>
<p>Lloyds Bank’s Client Banking team is a dedicated business area supporting the management of client funds. The bank currently manages over 200,000 client accounts and is a centre of excellence for managing clients’ funds for regulated entities.</p>
<p>Lloyds Bank has been voted Bank of the Year seven years running at the Finance Directors’ Excellence Awards.</p>
<p>A vastly experienced team works within the Client Banking department, with dedicated support for both customer relationship management and service, together with detailed sector specialisation for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Stockbrokers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pension administrators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Solicitors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Property managers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insolvency practitioners.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“We are experts in regulatory requirements, particularly client money rules requiring the segregation of client funds from corporate cash. Our customer base includes approximately 60% of the members of APCIMS (Association of Private Clients Investment Managers and Stockbrokers) together with the majority of the independent Self Invested Personal Pension (SIPP) providers,” says Hare.</p>
<p>The team also plays a significant advisory role. For example, in October 2009, Individual Liquidity Adequacy Standards (ILAS) were introduced by the FSA to ensure firms have adequate liquidity resources so that they can meet liabilities when they fall due. Lloyds Bank was the first to engage with corporate customers and advise them of the ILAS liquidity regulations. “This engagement has paid dividends and as a result the bank has very much become the trusted advisor to each and every client on its books,” says Hare.</p>
<p>Reacting innovatively to turn regulatory challenges into positives is another of the team’s areas of expertise. Under ILAS, for example, banks will increasingly seek funds of a higher liquidity value (for example, notice and term deposits) and customers will look for maximum return for short-term funds – this sometimes creates conflicts with customers requiring to maintain cash liquidity in order to invest. As a result, the Client Banking team at Lloyds Bank has developed a range of new products and solutions, working closely with its customers to ensure their clients’ funds are correctly classified to benefit from the new regulations.</p>
<p>For example, it recently launched a 95 day notice account, which allows clients to obtain LIBOR plus on deposits. The bank also keeps close to its customer base of regulated entities to help them meet their own regulatory requirements – such as segregation of client funds (as mentioned above) and the Retail Distribution Review (RDR).</p>
<h3 id=""tackling-the-low-interest-rate-environment"">Tackling the low interest rate environment</h3>
<p>“With interest rates so low, it is essential that investors optimise the return on their deposits,” says Hare. “The team has therefore enhanced the product offering with competitive market-led pricing across the whole product range. This range includes call accounts, current accounts, notice, fixed term (one day – five years), partial withdrawal, window term deposit and structured investment products.</p>

<br/>
<p>According to Hare, “Lloyds Bank also has a range of specific sector products built to maximise return. These products provide simple and effective yield optimisation analytics which consider the various types of deposit a customer may hold – operational cash, core cash and strategic cash. The team can then tailor the solution to meet the individual needs of our customers.” A noteworthy example of Lloyds’ liquidity optimisation suite of tools is the Revolver Programme, which provides a staggered deposits structure to maximise return without locking the funds away for long periods of time (see diagram).</p>
<p>The bank has also come up with a sophisticated work-around for corporates in regulated entities to make the most of their clients’ money by having the deposits reclassified as retail rather than wholesale deposits. A substantial uplift in the liquidity value can mean that reclassified funds attract better interest rates. “It is incumbent on the banks to lead the debate in these areas – and that’s exactly what we are doing,” says Hare. “This solution is a win-win, a way of taking the challenges that regulation and legislation bring and turning them into an opportunity.”</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p class=""management-summary"">Mattioli Woods is one of the UK’s leading providers of pension consultancy and wealth management services. It employs over 250 staff in the UK, administers over 2,900 SIPP schemes and 1,400 SSAS schemes and holds over £2.8 billion of assets under advice and administration. It keeps over £65m (in over 3,000 accounts) of its own and its clients’ money with the bank.</p>
<p>The pension company has a long-standing relationship with Lloyds Bank, and it is a relationship that has grown stronger over the years. “The willingness of the bank to have a relationship at a high level and to engage with us and understand our requirements is really important to us,” says Cowan. “Moreover, Lloyds has a good reputation and they have a name that people know. The level of trust is excellent.”</p>
<p>“The company installed Lloyds Bank’s i|SITE cash management system in 2006. The straight through processing between this system and the company’s existing administration portal, a bespoke system known as MWEB, is seamless. “In the last month we have installed a feed into our admin platform that’s gone live. It builds on the efficiencies the system has given us. The i|SITE system really differentiates Lloyds Bank from other banks.”</p>
<p>Another plus for Mattioli Woods is the refreshing approach its banking partner has taken to its interest rate policy on deposit accounts. “The banks have always treated pension fund money as commercial and classified it as corporate cash. This means that in general, banks cannot offer our pension fund clients the rates that are on offer to retail customers. The innovative approach adopted by Lloyds Bank allows us to offer our clients better rates than some other pension providers can access.”</p>
<p>“As interest rates have declined, it has been a real challenge to structure our accounts such that we can continue to offer good rates for SIPP and SSAS schemes. With Lloyds Bank we have been able to negotiate our own bespoke arrangements and this allows us to pass on the benefits to our customers. The big difference is that they can price our accounts by looking at our aggregate cash balance.”</p>
<p>Cowan singles out Lloyds Bank’s relationship manager, Suzanne Burgoyne, for particular praise. “She is someone we can always rely on,” he says. “We like to have one point of contact – which isn’t always the case at other banks. At Lloyds Bank, we know that whatever the issue, Suzanne will take ownership and deliver a solution, often co-ordinating input from across different parts of the bank. Since the financial crisis in 2008 this kind of service has been very rare. Other banks can’t compete with that.”</p>

<h3 id=""i-site"">i|SITE</h3>
<p>In addition to this expertise and innovation, the bank has a sophisticated technology offering available to its customers. “i|SITE is an award winning, online cash management system providing products and services that make a difference to corporate customers and their clients,” explains Hare.</p>
<p>“This delivers an effective and flexible cash management service which is secure and transparent, meeting the requirements of the FSA and other regulatory bodies.” i|SITE also provides real-time cash management facilities with 24 hour secure access to accounts, account opening capability with immediate ability to transact with secure access and the ability to tailor the authorisation process. “There is also seamless integration with back office systems and the system is fully encrypted with a complete audit trail.”</p>
<p>The Lloyds Bank team also works closely with trade bodies such as APCIMS and AMPS (Association of Member-Directed Pension Schemes) to ensure that the bank’s technology meets the needs of their members.</p>
<p>“i|SITE is a well-respected and trusted system,” says Hare. “The customer managing its clients’ funds opens an account with the branch of the bank and gets an individual account. This allows them to demonstrate segregation of funds, which is important for our clients in regulated industries.”</p>
<h3 id=""customer-centric-approach"">Customer-centric approach</h3>
<p>The Client Banking team at Lloyds Bank is a centre of excellence with expert sector knowledge, allowing it to understand its customers’ business and the challenges they face. According to Hare, the Client Banking team provides innovative deposit solutions from the bank’s extensive product range which are flexible and tailored to meet the needs of each customer. It can call upon a vast range of product partners from within the Lloyds Banking Group in areas such as transactional banking and treasury &amp; trading to help provide customers with a full range of capabilities and solutions.</p>
<p>Moreover, the team supports its corporate customers throughout the economic cycle to ensure their financial health, stability and growth. It is also committed to building deep and lasting relationships with customers and supporting their ongoing contributions to the UK economy. The bank aims to achieve this by becoming its customers’ ‘trusted advisor’.</p>
<p>“If you’re comfortable with the trusted advisor role, you should be attuned to what is happening in the client’s business and the market. It involves giving good council to clients, generating debate, and giving your customers a heads up on innovations in the market – really, it’s all about partnerships,” says Hare.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>With mounting pressure to improve controls and efficiency and to free up trapped cash, the treasurer’s role continues to expand. How then can group treasury optimise internal processes and the use of company cash when the treasury centre is lean, budgets are constrained and there are only so many hours in a day? In this Business Briefing we discuss the current issues facing group treasurers and explore approaches that can be taken to resolve these.</p>
<h3 id=""changing-requirements"">Changing requirements</h3>
<p>In an evolving market landscape, treasurers need to capture and formalise best practices for their organisations in order to address new complexities and challenges. Corporations have been moving steadily toward working capital optimisation by automating treasury functions through an integrated and co-ordinated approach. Automation also allows treasury to focus on its strategic and analytical functions by minimising time spent on routine operational processes.</p>
<p>The challenge, however, is to be able to relate recognised treasury best practice to the needs of the organisation, and in such a way that the business is not locked into rigid arrangements which restrict the company’s responsiveness and competitive edge. General trends such as globalisation, increased control and improved internal efficiency are influencing the areas on which corporate treasurers are currently focusing. These areas include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Visibility of cash.</h5>
<p>Group treasury needs to know how much cash the organisation has around the world, where that cash is, and how treasury can make use of it. Achieving visibility in this area can ensure that cash truly is a corporate asset, meaning that it is accessible and can be used to decrease short-term borrowings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Compliance.</h5>
<p>With the advent of SOX and increasingly strict audit requirements, the tools that treasurers use are coming under close scrutiny. It is no longer sufficient to run spreadsheets as pseudo treasury systems. Best practice requires an integrated, multi-functional treasury system which also incorporates relevant treasury policies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Risk management.</h5>
<p>Dealing with various entities in different locations increases FX risk, operational risk and counterparty risk. With many companies no longer having a regional treasury centre structure, it is the group treasurer who needs analytical tools to address and monitor emerging company and subsidiary risks efficiently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Flexibility.</h5>
<p>Treasury should have the flexibility to diverge from its historic policy where appropriate, not only to avoid potential losses but also to take advantage of opportunities presented by market or industry developments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The theory behind these objectives is all well and good, but putting theory into practice is often a different matter. A major hurdle faced by group treasury in implementing new practices or improving existing systems is the disconnection between the subsidiaries and the group treasury centre, which often stems from a misalignment of infrastructure and objectives (see below).</p>
<h3 id=""challenges-in-group-treasury"">Challenges in group treasury</h3>
<figure class=""center"">
<a class=""enlargeable"" href=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2008/11and12/2008-11and12-tt-07-bb-diagram-01-objectives-and-infrastructures.png""><img alt=""Diagram 1: Objectives and Infrastructures"" height=""298"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2008/11and12/2008-11and12-tt-07-bb-diagram-01-objectives-and-infrastructures-t.png"" width=""300""/></a>
</figure>
<p>There are two sides to the issue of disconnection.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Firstly, there is often insufficient information flow with regard to what the subsidiary company is doing, for example in terms of their currency positions, or simply how they are managing their cash forecasts and the standards that they apply. This in turn generates control concerns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondly, there may be a mismatch between group treasury’s needs and the priorities of the subsidiary. Group treasury seeks to manage risk on an aggregated, long-term basis. Subsidiaries, in contrast, have more immediate needs, such as funding requirements. As such, operating companies often resort to hoarding cash to cover any unexpected cash outflows, or to be able to respond to customers’ and suppliers’ needs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>How then can group treasury address this disconnection effectively?</p>
<h4 id=""information-management-real-time"">Information management: real-time</h4>
<p>The information reported to group treasury is typically not useful to the subsidiary itself and it is, therefore, often seen by the subsidiary as a secondary priority. The reporting process can be labour intensive and there is an element of duplication in reporting both locally and centrally for cash and risk management purposes. A group-wide information management tool may enable the treasury to automate tasks such as cash flow forecasting for the subsidiaries. If the tool also delivers real-time information, this will help the subsidiaries to understand the immediate impact that their reporting has on the company as a whole.</p>
<h4 id=""hedging"">Hedging</h4>
<p>An improved flow of information gives more opportunity to identify, measure, evaluate and ultimately to hedge FX risk, whether at subsidiary or group level and whether internally or externally. Running a centralised system that will monitor these hedges and the hedge exposure will not only reduce the workload but also ensure that all processes are fully auditable and compliant. Linking company-wide FX exposure will also bring treasury closer to the business.</p>
<h4 id=""creating-discipline"">Creating discipline</h4>
<p>One approach which may be used to align the subsidiaries with the group treasury is to bring discipline to inter-company settlement processes. This can either be done centrally or by giving the subsidiaries a tool which makes it easier for them to be managed. For example, a tool which allows inter-company netting of payables and receivables will further reduce the number of external transactions, thereby reducing cost and counterparty risk and benefitting all business units.</p>
<h4 id=""getting-buy-in"">Getting buy-in</h4>
<p>Unless there is a culture where the corporate centre demands and the subsidiary responds, any proposition made to the subsidiaries needs to be a value-add for them too. Group treasury should market itself to the subsidiaries and gather support by taking into account different practices and cultures. There is also a need to recognise that a discipline suitable for one line of business may not be appropriate for another, due to being in different markets or varying stages of development. The challenge is ensuring that the subsidiaries realise that all disciplines need to roll up into group treasury in a consistent and efficient way.</p>
<h3 id=""overcoming-the-obstacles"">Overcoming the obstacles</h3>
<p>Large corporates that have well staffed treasury departments and sophisticated technologies have managed to solve the majority of these challenges, but not without a budget commensurate with their size. Most treasury departments do not have the budget for a large technology spend however, so what is the answer?</p>
<p>In an ideal world, operating a single ERP system group-wide and having only one global bank and one set of policies would go some way to solving the disconnection issues that group treasury faces. In reality, however, most corporates do not have a single set of systems, standards and relationships, with some companies not even having their payables and receivables in the same accounting system. Group treasury departments need tools that will combine real-time cash position reporting and forecasting together with straight through processing (STP) and current, detailed information to help them overcome these problems.</p>
<h4 id=""traditional-solutions"">Traditional solutions</h4>
<p>Historically, corporates have had two options available to them: either they buy a standalone treasury management system (TMS) or they buy a treasury module for their ERP system. Both approaches have their benefits and downsides:</p>
<h5 id=""advantages"">Advantages</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They are widely available, proven solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A TMS has sophisticated treasury specific functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A TMS can be hosted by a systems provider, which gives more flexibility for upgrades.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ERP treasury modules can offer increased visibility as ERPs are company-wide systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An ERP offers opportunities for standardisation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The potential for comprehensive front, middle and back-office reporting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id=""disadvantages"">Disadvantages</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The cost of implementation is high.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The time dedicated to a TMS or ERP implementation can be years, not months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A TMS is standalone and can be difficult to integrate with existing systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ERPs are managed centrally, which means that upgrades have to be made according to a central schedule – this can be slow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ERP systems are not always designed specifically to interface with external parties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many companies run several ERP systems – which would mean that buying a single treasury module would be much like deploying a standalone TMS.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h5 id=""what-is-j-p-morgans-treasury-online-application"">What is J.P. Morgan’s Treasury OnLine application?</h5>
<p>Treasury OnLine (ToL) is an all-in-one application that enables risk analysis, dealing, cash flow forecasting and inter-company netting for corporate treasury centres. It electronically links subsidiaries to the head office and automates manual processes in line with treasury policy. It’s a browser application and nothing needs to be installed at the client’s location.</p>
<p>The structure is ‘modular’, but these are not modules in the classic bolt-on TMS or ERP sense. There’s a dealing module, a risk analysis module, a cash module and a netting module all integrated to use a common database.</p>
<h5 id=""could-you-explain-a-bit-more-about-how-the-modules-work"">Could you explain a bit more about how the modules work?</h5>
<p>Really it’s all down to how the client allocates permissions to the users, the functions they seek and how those functions are set up. If we take netting, for example, does the client want multiple netting centres? Should the netting cycles overlap? How will items settle – net or gross? We can also consider netting by payables, receivables or both and inter-company or third-party netting. So you can see that it’s very flexible.</p>
<p>Clients can execute basic FX deals such as spots, forwards and swaps in the dealing module, both inter-company and externally. Again, these can be restricted by entity and by individual user, in terms of which of those instruments they can use. Clients can set limits so that if subsidiaries trade above a certain limit, the deal is flagged for central approval but the subsidiary can continue to use the system whilst awaiting approval.</p>
<p>With the risk analysis module, clients can load their balance sheet straight up out of the general ledger or they can load up balance sheets at subsidiary levels and roll them up into consolidated view to see their currency exposures. The client can also load up multi-currency revenue and expense to determine earnings-at-risk, and also identify subsidiary cash flows that may be used as earnings-at-risk hedge proxies.</p>
<p>In the cash module, bank account information can be consolidated with daily, weekly and monthly forecasts to improve multicurrency liquidity management. Currency exposure can be analysed and hedging proposals can be generated in line with pre-defined policy parameters.</p>
<h5 id=""how-will-they-benefit-from-choosing-tol"">Who is the target customer and how will they benefit from choosing ToL?</h5>
<p>ToL will be most useful to mid-size to large corporates with a multinational footprint and, typically, with a very lean treasury staff just in the corporate centre, not distributed around the world. It is less likely to offer the same level of value to the very largest corporates because they have typically invested in a single ERP or a TMS or both and they have all these disciplines.</p>
<p>ToL will give group treasurers a basis for more efficient cash management and risk management process because a lot of the emails, spreadsheets and routine data manipulation can be eliminated. It can be more effective because both treasury and the operating companies are working on real-time information. ToL is a scalable solution which can provide 90% of the benefits of a TMS at a fraction of the cost and implementation time. The corporate decides how complex it needs its operational environment to be and this can be rapidly parameterised into series of permissions to meet those needs.</p>

<h3 id=""industry-innovation"">Industry innovation</h3>
<p>Although there are tools available that are not full-blown TMSs, such as multi-lateral netting products or cash management products, these applications do not usually combine both of these disciplines together with risk management and dealing capabilities. J.P. Morgan’s Treasury OnLine (ToL) is an example of a solution from a leading bank which combines all of these capabilities together with global access to J.P. Morgan’s latest market research in one holistic, web-based solution.</p>
<p>In addition, J.P. Morgan is currently implementing a new platform for its proven ToL application so that it now has enhanced functionality, allowing the client to integrate its treasury policy into its daily functions. The application is designed to facilitate medium to large sized corporates to eliminate some of the issues faced by their group treasuries with only a modest effort and budget. ToL is designed to allow information to flow freely from subsidiary companies to the group treasury so that group treasury can have increased visibility over the company as a whole and integrate cash management into business processes.</p>
<p>ToL is a multi-bank application that runs off an integrated single database for execution and reporting. The application provides advance knowledge and timing of cash flows. It can also monitor the currency of cash flows. Data extracted from the corporate’s ERP, AP (Accounts Payable) or AR (Accounts Receivable) systems is aggregated by currency, out into the future, and can then be enriched by remote input of current information from the subsidiaries’ locations. ToL also incorporates FX instruments which are aimed at managing uncertainty of timing and amount, often a significant challenge for group treasurers.</p>
<figure class=""center"">

<p class=""source"">ToL Dashboard</p>
</figure>
<p>With ToL, treasury is positioned in the middle of the revenue and expenditure cycles where treasury manages currency risk and working capital efficiency while subsidiaries can focus on being responsive to their customers’ needs and supplier obligations.</p>
<h3 id=""where-is-the-smart-money"">Where is the smart money?</h3>
<p>The current environment demands the deployment of risk management tools and techniques that strike a balance between operational flexibility and strong financial discipline – flexibility to respond to business opportunities and discipline to protect cash as a corporate asset. Such tools will need to be globally available, but with the ability to deploy by business or region and to address each discipline, such as cash forecasting, inter-company netting and currency exposure management.</p>
<p>If a company has specific and highly sophisticated hedging needs, these will probably be best met by a full scale TMS, which will of course require sufficient resources and planning. If, however, a corporate is looking to benefit from the type of solutions which a TMS can provide, but on a scalable level, and without the implementation time and cost, an all-in-one treasury application that allows multi-bank, cross-border transactions could be an ideal solution. Corporates will be able to benefit from browser based tools and carry out all the functions they would expect from an off-the-shelf software house package, including real-time updates.</p>
<p>One final challenge is presenting a convincing business case for treasury’s proposed technology spend. However, if, as Desouza says, 90% of the benefits that the largest corporations have gleaned from having sophisticated technology in place can be obtained through a relatively modest effort, the advantages of this type of approach are clear.</p>

Driving efficiencies for post-merger treasury integration,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Global merger and acquisition<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup> volumes reached historic heights in 2007. Following the liquidity crunch onset, global M&amp;A volume is likely to be lower in 2008 and the nature of M&amp;A is expected to be different. What is certain is that cross-border activity will continue and the emerging markets will remain a dominant force. During the period 22<sup>nd</sup> December 2007 to 21<sup>st</sup> March 2008, the number of global M&amp;A deals announced within the top industries has topped 10,000 valued at $493 billion. (Source: Reuters 31/03/08)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Shareholders in Scottish &amp; Newcastle have voted overwhelmingly to back the £10 billion bid for Britain’s biggest brewer by a consortium of Carlsberg and Heineken.”</p>
<p><cite>Reuters 31/03/08</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Tata Motors announced it has entered into a definitive agreement with the Ford Motor Company for the purchase of Jaguar Land Rover in a $2.3 billion deal. This excludes Ford’s contribution of up to approximately $600m to the Jaguar Land Rover pension plans.”</p>
<p><cite>Reuters 31/03/08</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This unprecedented era of merger and acquisitions activity is being driven by three key forces:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Globalisation.</h5>
<p>Emerging markets growth is having a major impact. In terms of global investment, 25% of every dollar invested now involves India or China. Emerging market multinationals are playing an increasingly bigger role in M&amp;A activity – for example, Mittal of India’s acquisition of Arcelor and the takeover of IBM’s PC division by Lenovo (a Chinese computer manufacturer). The current weakness of the US dollar is also providing some attractive prey in the United States.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Investor activism.</h5>
<p>This is becoming more and more prevalent with investors not afraid to voice an opinion and, in some cases, openly criticise management for underperformance. The recent case of activist investor Trian Fund and HJ Heinz in the US is a good example of this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Private equity.</h5>
<p>A recent survey reported that by 2009, up to €1 trillion<sup id=""fnref:2""><a href=""#fn:2"" rel=""footnote"">2</a></sup> would be at the disposal of private equity in Europe. Very few of Europe’s listed companies are now out of range of private equity bidders.</p>

<p>This Business Briefing identifies the key treasury integration factors companies should consider when acquiring or divesting companies (see diagram).</p>
<p>In addition, we have included two case studies to highlight some of the key elements.</p>
<h4 id=""a-focus-on-settlement-and-execution"">A focus on settlement and execution</h4>
<p>Before we can really focus on integrating the two organisations, it is important to settle and execute the M&amp;A transaction. Effective execution requires outstanding end-to-end operational competence. This may have to be on a global basis where cross-border M&amp;A is concerned. When supported by robust project planning methodology and effective use of your business partners, positive results can be achieved.</p>

<p class=""source"">As mergers and acquisitions continue to occur both domestically and cross-border, many companies need the assistance of a trusted agent to help them manage through the complexities of their transaction.</p>
</figure>
<p>Effective planning goes a long way in mitigating the risk of things going wrong during this critical phase. Whilst the diagram on the previous page shows the key tasks as sequential, some are performed concurrently and certain companies will have considered treasury integration at the pre-deal stage. Once the execution is completed the task of treasury integration can really begin in earnest. The diagram on the right illustrates the key challenges, risks, success factors and solutions required in respect of the settlement and execution stage (for an example, please see the Philips Case Study).</p>
<p>The Board of Directors and shareholders will be looking for some early evidence of the benefits of their M&amp;A decision and it is during the treasury integration phase that these first benefits can be realised. The ability to extract the maximum value from the new organisation in the shortest timeframe is absolutely vital. The treasury department is ideally placed to identify what needs to be done and, importantly, deliver some ‘quick wins’ as well as determine the longer term, more strategic treasury integration goals of the new company.</p>
<p>Many organisations are already re-engineering or planning to re-engineer their processes, systems, technology and working capital/cash/liquidity management practices. However, M&amp;A activity very often provides the catalyst for such re-engineering, as the perceived benefits of an enlarged organisation accelerate the need to deliver the synergies, cost savings and other benefits which drove the M&amp;A decision in the first place.</p>
<p>As an example, if bank accounts required for the new organisation are to be rationalised and cash visibility improved, debt taken on to fund the acquisition can be paid down quicker with real benefits falling straight to the bottom line. Another example of a quick win is the increase in straight-through-processing (STP), which the new company may now be able to achieve as a result of system and process synergies with early and quantifiable benefits.</p>
<h4 id=""treasury-integration"">Treasury integration</h4>
<p>The diagram below identifies the main areas the treasury function needs to address as part of the treasury integration stage and, again, there will be some tactical as well as strategic decisions needed. The treasury function will work hand-in-hand with HR, procurement, technology, legal and its banking partners during this phase. The NXP Case Study opposite is an example of the real value of effective early planning and coordination to deliver an effective spin-off.</p>

<h3 id=""seal-the-deal"">Seal the deal: the critical role of settlement and execution</h3>
<p class=""management-summary"">Royal Philips Electronics is a global leader in healthcare, lighting and consumer products based in the Netherlands.</p>
<h4 id=""the-challenge-1"">The challenge</h4>
<p>As part of a series of strategic acquisitions in the US healthcare sector, Philips issued a tender offer to purchase Respironics, a medical-equipment manufacturer specialising in machines that treat chronic breathing disorders in the home. The €3.6 billion ($5.2 billion) acquisition (the largest in the company’s history) was expected to progress slowly to mandatory offer status, so Philips required an agency and trust provider that could keep them fully informed of the bid’s progress and act quickly when required.</p>
<h4 id=""the-solution-1"">The solution</h4>
<p>Having worked for Philips on a number of successful US acquisitions, Citi was selected as tender and exchange agent for the Respironics purchase. Throughout a series of tender extensions, Citi processed letters of transmittal from Respironics’ 25,000+ retail and institutional shareholders, the latter represented by the Depository Trust Company. Citi also provided a 24-hour hotline to inform Philips that acceptances had reached the required 90% threshold within minutes of the close of the final offer extension. This information bolstered Philips’ decision to pursue the acquisition and – once the offer became mandatory – Citi’s ability to pay out to accepting shareholders and transfer registration of shares in just two days was critical in securing a short-form merger agreement in Delaware Court of Chancery, thus avoiding further delays and costs. Having handled disbursements to accepting shareholders, Citi directed the remaining cash available to acquire outstanding minority shareholdings ($278m) to a money market fund that invested in US Treasury bonds selected by Philips. As the transaction coincided with a very substantial shift into US Treasuries by investors, Citi had to identify a second fund that met Philips’ requirements within a matter of hours to invest the cash fully while awaiting payment to the remaining shareholders. As the minority shareholdings were acquired, Citi immediately liquidated the money market fund positions to pay out shareholders and forward additional investment returns to Philips.</p>
<h4 id=""the-verdict"">The verdict</h4>
<p>Use of a flexible, responsive trusted business partner was pivotal to the successful settlement and execution of an important cross-border acquisition, such acquisition later described by Philips CEO Gerard Kleisterlee as “an excellent strategic fit.”</p>


<h2 id=""case-study-2"">Case study</h2>
<img alt=""NXP"" class=""logo org"" height=""33"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/nxp-logo-2008-120x33.png"" width=""120""/>
<h3 id=""mission-possible"">Mission possible: a standalone treasury in three months</h3>
<p class=""management-summary"">NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors) was divested in October, 2006 to a private equity consortium.</p>
<h4 id=""the-challenge-2"">The challenge</h4>
<p>NXP’s acquisition timetable gave its treasury team barely three months to establish fully-functioning cash and treasury processes. As Philips Semiconductors, the business had used the shared resources of Philips’ central treasury and payment factory. As NXP, it required collection and disbursement accounts in 35 countries and a centralised liquidity management structure, supported by standardised connectivity to provide visibility and control.</p>
<h4 id=""the-solution-2"">The solution</h4>
<p>Citi was mandated NXP’s global cash management business on the basis of its global reach and a track record of meeting tight deadlines. Once deliverables were scoped and agreed, in July 2006, NXP and Citi appointed dedicated teams to ensure a disciplined, on-schedule implementation, tapping additional resources as necessary. Technical support was required for establishing host-to-host communication, file testing, and treasury integration with NXP’s ERP and treasury management system; close liaison with legal departments was needed to meet account opening documentation requirements.</p>
<p>For each country, NXP outlined its preferred account structures and worked with Citi to address any local restrictions, particularly in certain Asian jurisdictions. Using target balance accounts, domestic and cross-border cash pooling structures were established to coordinate liquidity management. Strict deadlines were set for account opening to enable NXP and Citi to conduct the necessary systems testing and to communicate account changes to business counterparties. To provide standardised connectivity and visibility, the CitiDirect<sup>®</sup> Online Banking electronic banking platform was rolled out in all countries. A centralised payments structure was implemented in which NXP’s ERP system sends payment files via Citibank<sup>®</sup> File Services for routing and in-country execution.</p>
<h4 id=""the-result"">The result</h4>
<p>On October 2, 2006, the deadline for completion of the spin-off process, NXP’s treasury function went live with a fully-integrated, single bank cash management solution across all regions. “Tight coordination between implementation teams was critical to achieving our goal,” said Luc de Dobbeleer, Head of Cash and Risk Management at NXP. With the backbone of the cash and treasury processes now in place, the next step was to refine and optimise the infrastructure through further automation and process standardisation.</p>

<p>The importance of sound project management methodology should not be underestimated in the treasury integration phase:</p>

<p>M&amp;A activity is here to stay and companies of all shapes and sizes are developing M&amp;A strategies to deliver the growth expected by their shareholders. This is a truly global playing field and we are already witnessing a shift of focus as players from the emerging markets become investors. Successful companies are effective at M&amp;A, but the real winners are not only extremely good at identifying the target and executing the deal – they also devote significant time and effort to the treasury integration stage of the M&amp;A process.</p>
<p>After all, the prime purpose of any M&amp;A activity is to improve what you have today. Without a coherent and effective treasury integration strategy, the benefits may take years to materialise or, worse still, not be achieved.</p>

Global treasury management – taking an end-to-end approach ,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The global economy has shown great resilience in recent years despite rising oil prices and several natural disasters. Growth in the US, Japan and the Eurozone averaged 2.4% in 2005, down from 2.9% the previous year. In stark contrast Asia and other emerging markets have continued to grow at a breathtaking pace (<a href=""#figure-1-world-gdp-percentage-growth-rates"">see Figure 1 below</a>). Growth in market liquidity and interest rates close to all-time lows has resulted in greater M&amp;A activity and higher rates of investment on a global basis. Controls on foreign ownership have been relaxed in several Asian markets including, importantly, China, as a means of encouraging inward foreign direct investment (FDI). Aggregate gross domestic product (GDP) for Asia expanded by a robust 7.4% in 2005 led by China and India. Demand for emerging markets output is expected to remain very healthy in this current business cycle. This has had a dramatic impact on the treasury management arena as corporations continue to move their focus to these emerging economies in search of new business and profits.</p>
<p>This new environment is therefore driving rapid change within the finance function. The natural expansion of the treasurer’s role beyond its traditional bank balance and transaction management responsibilities is being accelerated further. Rapid growth in the emerging markets is placing even greater demands on the treasurer, as trade flows are now required to be managed in countries and currencies hitherto considered ‘exotic’. Their impact and importance is, quite simply, too great to be ignored. The liquidity upheavals this summer have heightened the importance of effective global treasury management and optimisation of internal liquidity. The dynamics are shifting on a number of fronts and the issues faced by corporate treasurers are as challenging now as they have ever been.</p>
<p>In this Business Briefing we assess the new challenges faced by the treasury department, the drivers of globalisation and the benefits which can be achieved through an ‘end-to-end’ approach to treasury management on a truly global basis.</p>

<h3 id=""drivers-of-globalisation-within-the-treasury-function"">Drivers of globalisation within the treasury function</h3>
<p>The increasing globalisation of business, together with a geographic and market shift towards increased volatility is leading companies to devote greater attention to cost and risk with a view to improving cash management processes. In particular, many companies are now actively evaluating the pros and cons of moving to globally centralised models for an increasing range of functions, taking an ‘end-to-end’ approach to treasury management.</p>
<p>These companies focusing on global treasury management, often share the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fast growing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Large proportion of business conducted in rapid growth emerging markets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Receptive to fast organisational evolution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Management culture open to speedy decision making and quick implementation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The trend towards end-to-end global treasury management is leading some companies to re-evaluate the fragmented banking approach, as globalised banking models can yield substantial scale economies.</p>
<p>Such companies are now explicitly evaluating a trade-off of treasury centralisation versus reciprocity of banking services for credit extended and there are cost implications to consider of slicing the cake differently. As only a handful of service providers can offer these truly global treasury solutions, corporations now have to find alternative means of rewarding those banks which provide credit and yet are currently relatively limited in their offering of globalised banking solutions.</p>
<p>Rather than following the tried and trusted models of country first, then regional overlay, some companies are making step-change transition straight to a truly global model. We are also witnessing an increase in this consultative/advisory type approach rather than banks merely being asked to respond to the more traditional request for proposal (RFP) process of buying banking services.</p>
<p>This approach requires an entirely different mindset to achieve the desired end result from the vision through to optimisation of the benefits. This is new territory for many companies and they are now seeking advice on how to go about this global journey and how to adopt an entirely new operating model (<a href=""#fig-2-end-to-end-e2e-treasury-approach"">see Figure 2 below</a>).</p>
<p>Citi’s recent experiences working with clients suggest companies are also re-defining the role of treasury to be much more strategic rather than merely transaction execution. For example, a large global electronics company recently approached Citi with a request to prepare a ‘White Paper’ on ‘How to create an effective global treasury function’. Banks have a role to play in helping the treasury department achieve its strategic aims as well as providing the traditional banking products and services.</p>

</figure>
<p>As companies move their focus away from deregulated markets where cash management is relatively simple, to regulated emerging economies such as the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China), so the challenges get tougher. Such markets have intrinsic volatility and are growing at a rapid pace so the requirement to maintain an effective and standardised control mechanism is even more crucial.</p>
<p>Technology is obviously a key driver in this space and treasury departments have to leverage automation to the full. Companies need a clear global technology strategy as they wrestle to undertake more and more both in quantity and complexity with flat or, worse still, reduced headcount. The aim is to establish a single real-time data window onto an increasingly broad business empire.</p>
<h4 id=""an-end-to-end-approach-visibility-control-and-optimisation"">An end-to-end approach = visibility, control and optimisation</h4>
<p>By taking such an end-to-end approach, corporate treasurers will be able to realise measurable improvements in three key areas;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Visibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimisation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=""visibility"">Visibility</h4>
<p>Over time as market intensity increases it becomes increasingly important, particularly so during times of volatility, for treasurers to be able to access information where they want it, when they want it and in a format that is easy to understand and act upon quickly. The trend is moving away from such data being based on weekly or monthly cycles, to daily and even real-time multi-bank information feeds. This is laying firm foundations for companies seeking to improve the control and optimisation of their liquidity on a global basis, and reducing amounts of liquidity remaining trapped or even unmonitored.</p>
<p>In some cases, apart from the market and competitive drivers mentioned earlier, there is also a regulatory impetus for improved data visibility, such as Sarbanes-Oxley. This particular requirement is driving companies to recognise the importance of the treasury function and encouraging operating units and subsidiaries to provide central treasury with information in a timely, accurate and consistent manner.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this requirement is driving improved sharing of data through common standards. There is also increased recognition that cash is an asset which can be utilised far more effectively if the central treasury function knows about it and is able to have effective dialogue with business units from sharing a single common data view.</p>
<p>Currently, many companies derive this data view from large ERP and / or TMS solutions. However, these can be expensive and time-consuming to change or update and are not always easily accessible to business units. Information exchange between central treasury and operating units should be based on robust yet scalable platforms, such as Citi’s TreasuryVision, which can be shared across the enterprise and work alongside the more functionally rich ERP / TMS systems. Such emerging infrastructures are enabling treasurers to add value far beyond the historical treasury boundaries.</p>
<h4 id=""control"">Control</h4>
<p>We highlighted earlier the importance of emerging markets on cash management structures as overall liquidity growth slows down. It is therefore essential to establish a robust control environment. This includes standardising treasury policy and procedures and risk management frameworks to accommodate business expansion in a diverse range of markets. The ability to understand risk profiles better will help corporate treasurers in terms of working capital management and the company’s balance sheet.</p>
<p>The demand to analyse volatility on a real-time basis is fuelled by a greater understanding of risk exposure and scenario modeling and we will start to see a wider range of products being introduced by service providers. Spreadsheet-based tools will decline in favour of integrated web-based solutions providing much higher levels of accuracy, automation, workflow management and, importantly, security.</p>
<p>Cash flow forecasting is one area where we expect to see improvements in the solutions offered and these will be integrated with the liquidity solutions.</p>
<h4 id=""optimisation"">Optimisation</h4>
<p>The developed markets around the globe facilitate a range of funding choices. The challenge for treasurers when global liquidity structures are established is how to optimise surplus liquidity automatically within such global structures. It is relatively easy to mobilise and transfer working capital within the developed markets. SEPA is an example of deregulation that will further facilitate funds transfer within the EU.</p>
<p>However, this is in stark contrast to the completely different landscape in the emerging markets. These countries are still highly regulated or deregulating at a much slower pace than the EU and US which, therefore, restricts funding choices. The tools and techniques used by corporate treasurers in the cash management space in the developed economies are not easily replicated in the emerging markets, although we are seeing new solutions emerging, such as interest optimisation.</p>

<h2 id=""case-study"">Case Study</h2>
<h3 id=""lg-electronics"">LG Electronics</h3>

<h4 class=""fn"">S. H. Koo</h4>
<h4 class=""title"">Global Treasurer</h4>
<img alt=""LG Electronics"" class=""logo org"" height=""27"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/lg-electronics-logo-2007-120x27.png"" width=""120""/>

<p>A global electronics manufacturer with 82 subsidiaries across four core businesses, LG Electronics historically supported subsidiaries’ cash processes through a network of regional treasury centres. However, in 2005, the company decided to establish a global treasury centre to achieve a more coordinated, end-to-end approach to cash and liquidity management. “We wanted to reduce interest costs and the various bank fees. Also we wanted to optimise cash balances, and establish common processes that would leave subsidiaries ‘cash free’ and able to concentrate resources on core tasks. Furthermore we needed greater visibility over the global daily cash position.” says S. H. Koo, Global Treasurer, LG Electronics Inc.</p>
<p>LG Electronics’ first step toward standardisation and centralisation was to replace local bank-supplied systems and manual cash processes with the installation of a global treasury management system. Its global treasury centre was established as an in-house bank which both centralised inflows from subsidiaries and initiated external payments on their behalf, thereby introducing common processes across the firm. Following a benchmarking project and RFP, Citi was selected to support the new treasury structure and implement a global multi-currency notional pool to consolidate liquidity at Citi’s London branch. Starting in Q4 2006, funds are swept automatically on an end of day basis from subsidiaries’ target balance accounts to corresponding treasury accounts in London for notional offset. Balances at third-party banks are automatically swept via a SWIFT message-based platform. This structure includes 41 subsidiaries from 23 countries and now pools balances denominated in 12 currencies. Besides this structure, LG Electronics has a separate pooling structure in China (16 subsidiaries, two currencies) for regulatory reasons.</p>
<p>Citi is able to provide its multi-currency notional offset offering through an interest-parity framework which replicates the benefits achieved through FX swaps. While notional pools have typically consolidated excess liquidity in a single currency, eg in EUR or USD, LG Electronics has been able to incorporate cash flows in many more currencies (including HUF, PLZ, CZR) in a single ‘pot’, thus capturing a much larger percentage of surplus funds for investment or balance sheet purposes. Importantly, because the end-of-day multi-bank TBA sweeping process is fully automated, the administrative burdens of liquidity management are minimised while the scope of the pool is increased to a truly global level.</p>
<p>In addition, to improve control and visibility of newly-standardised transaction flows, the firm established a global payment factory with Citi and two other banks that consolidates all payments from subsidiaries into a single file which is then forwarded to these banks for routing and execution. To complete the transaction cycle, payment reconciliation data and balance information on all treasury and subsidiary account balances is provided into LG Electronics’ treasury management system, which enables the firm to generate accounting entries automatically.</p>
<p>From transaction execution to liquidity management through to control and reporting, LG has implemented a streamlined, end-to-end treasury structure which has achieved the firm’s objectives, while also creating a platform for future efficiencies. As well as interest savings through cash optimisation and improved cash flow forecasting through greater visibility, cost reductions have accrued from common processes that have increased automation and reduced banking interfaces. “Only now that we are following common processes company-wide, we can make decisions – such as our use of communications networks – based on a global strategy. Moreover, we work more effectively with the businesses, because we’re all using the same processes and tools,” says Mr. Koo.</p>

<p>However, the choice to establish a global treasury management structure is not taken lightly and the company’s board will expect an attractive return on investment (ROI). For this reason, those banks operating in this space are devoting far more time now in assisting companies with the cost/benefit analyses and in justifying the internal business case to proceed.</p>
<p>One means of doing this in respect of a cross-currency liquidity structure is to analyse the mix of currency balances over a period and work out the cost of converting the basket of currencies to a base currency using swaps. This very often provides a very visible and compelling argument to support the business case.</p>
<p>Regional liquidity structures have been common for a while for global currencies such as USD and EUR, and in some cases these currencies have been managed on a global basis. We are now seeing the emergence of cross-currency structures such as multi-currency notional pools, which are creating an entire new set of possibilities for corporate treasuries to partner their business units as well as broaden coverage of the corporate balance sheet. Banks have also started developing solutions covering more regulated markets, such as cross-border interest optimisation structures which can function on a stand-alone basis, or integrated with a global liquidity structure.</p>
<p>The end-to-end approach referred to earlier is complemented with a focus on the investment of net surplus funds. The primary purpose of managing the company cash on a global basis is to avoid the need to go to external sources for funding.</p>
<p>As market liquidity tightens, it is more important than ever, that companies make their surplus cash work harder through the right investment choice. Money Market Funds, long popular in the US, are emerging globally as an increasingly popular shortterm investment asset class.</p>
<p>On-line portals which allow access to all balances instantly are on the increase and it is important to have access to a sufficient number of counterparties and asset classes via on-line investment portals to ensure an appropriate portfolio mix. Furthermore, once investments have been executed, the portals should provide reports on balances and current yields quickly and accurately on a daily basis, as well as enhanced analytics such as portfolio yield and performance against pre-determined benchmarks.</p>
<p>Another route being increasingly explored is the concept of ‘drain the pool’ automated investments, where liquidity structures are linked to investments through automated rules based on treasuries’ investment policies, ensuring investment decisions are optimised.</p>

<h4 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h4>
<p>Corporate growth has been increasingly shifting towards faster growing but volatile emerging markets, particularly the BRIC economies. We are also seeing a marked change in liquidity; the benevolent environment of recent years has become significantly more inclement, with the verdict still out on how broadly the contagion spreads.</p>
<p>This transition is shifting attention to step change efficiencies across the enterprise with the finance function rapidly moving to centre of plate, as the premium on access to liquidity increases, and fully utilising internal liquidity becomes increasingly paramount. Treasurers’ workloads have been increasing in terms of both quantity and complexity as increasing business demands outpace resources available. Couple this with the trend towards doing business in new and often volatile markets across different time-zones and the finance function’s challenges are measurably more difficult than ever before.</p>
<p>It is only by taking an end-to-end approach to global treasury management, that corporate treasurers will be able to satisfy the conflicting demands of efficiency and control, constrained resources, as well as scalability and flexibility for growth. Fortunately, this increase in demand for end-to-end treasury solutions is starting to be met by global banks.</p>
<p>Those with extensive country coverage and global technology platforms are well placed to respond to this growing global trend. We could therefore start to see a fundamental change in the treasury management marketplace within the corporate and service provider universes in the next few years as the market evolves to the next stage.</p>
