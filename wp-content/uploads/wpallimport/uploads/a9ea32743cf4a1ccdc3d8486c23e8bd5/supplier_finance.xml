<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>While people around the world may be beginning to look beyond the pandemic, supply chains continue to face major disruption. Shortages of products including semiconductors and shipping containers have threatened production and lengthened transit times. At the same time, severe port congestion in the US, the global energy crisis and the UK’s HGV driver shortage have all challenged supply chains in a variety of ways, from soaring costs to late deliveries.</p>
<p>The impact of these issues has been felt around the world. “Globalisation means that supply chains are incredibly complex,” says Alexander Mutter, Managing Director, Head of Enterprise EMEA at <a href="https://pages.taulia.com/scaling-supplier-finance-whitepaper.html?utm_source=Partnerships&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=Q3-TT-Article-October-21&amp;utm_content=article&amp;utm_term=TT-October" target="_blank">Taulia</a>. “An issue taking place in one country can have significant reverberations in other countries.”</p>
<p>With China accounting for almost 15% of global exports in 2020, Mutter notes that an increase in demand from China is contributing to fluctuations in the availability and pricing of certain resources. “The demand we see is not just in semiconductors, but also in raw materials including wood – in fact, the price of wood has doubled in the last couple of months, while delivery times have increased from four weeks to six to eight months,” he notes.</p>
<h4 id="supply-chain-goals">Supply chain goals</h4>
<p>According to Mutter, these disruptions have sharpened the focus of the C-level on finding new ways of protecting businesses from supply chain disruption. “The COVID-19 pandemic, in particular, showed how fragile global trade and supply chains are,” he says. “And of course, if you have experienced the risk, you have to find a solution.”</p>
<p>In this climate, Mutter says CFOs are focusing on three key considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>ESG</strong> – many companies are focusing on driving improvements across some of the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and are setting clear targets that they are looking to achieve over a given timeframe. Against this backdrop, a lot of companies are also looking more closely at supplier relationship management. Whereas previously companies may have focused on profitability and negotiating attractive pricing, today the focus is more on partnership and achieving joint objectives with suppliers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Digitisation</strong> – data visibility is another focus, and in practice a lot of interruptions occur due to a lack of automation. Many companies lack a homogeneous infrastructure and may be using multiple ERP instances, resulting in inefficiencies. The solution is to achieve the end-to-end optimisation of digital processes, from e-invoicing to the integration of ERP systems, and to build overarching solutions that provide enhanced data visibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Working capital/sourcing</strong> – while companies may be able to improve their working capital by extending the payment terms offered to suppliers, Mutter notes that those payment terms “really should be fair – I think there’s a rethinking in some businesses as to what fair payment terms are.” And where sourcing is concerned, Mutter says companies are increasingly looking at pre-payments to ensure they can source the raw materials they need.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time, efforts to optimise working capital are being driven not only by the need to stabilise supply chains, but also by a focus on business growth as companies navigate a return to more normal economic patterns. As well as seeking to grow organically, many companies are focusing on inorganic growth opportunities in today’s buoyant M&amp;A; market.</p>
<p>“There’s always some degree of consolidation going on, but post-pandemic we are seeing more than usual,” says Mutter. “And corporates want to be prepared so that they can act if they see an opportunity.” He adds that this often means financing deals using the company’s liquidity – which again is driving a renewed focus on working capital.</p>
<h4 id="supply-chain-solutions">Supply chain solutions</h4>
<p>For companies looking to address the challenges brought by globalisation and changing customer demand, technology has an increasingly important role to play in making supply chains more flexible and efficient. While technology investment can often slow down in uncertain economic environments, this has not been the case during the pandemic: in late 2020, a survey of 200 senior-level supply chain executives by Ernst &amp; Young found that 92% did not halt their technology investments.</p>
<p>And in today’s market, there is a wide range of supply chain solutions available to help companies solve a wide range of challenges. Taulia, for example, is  a holistic working capital platform, with solutions including accounts payable: dynamic discounting and <a href="https://taulia.com/solutions/buyer-solutions/supply-chain-finance/?utm_source=Partnerships&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=Q3-TT-Article-October-21&amp;utm_content=article&amp;utm_term=TT-October" target="_blank">supply chain finance</a>, accounts receivable and inventory management solutions.</p>
<p>Different industries may have different strategies when it comes to adopting supply chain solutions. “Particularly in the retail sector, we see ESG as a top priority,” says Mutter. “On the automotive side, we see a lot of collaboration with suppliers: OEMs are looking for supplier health rescue programmes to really understand how they can help suppliers if needed.”</p>
<h4 id="flexiblity-liquidity-sustainability">Flexibility, liquidity, sustainability</h4>
<p>Whatever the core goals, says Mutter, many companies are focusing on building a technology infrastructure that enables them to have a well-organised and documented method of paying suppliers early. Often companies choose to offer their suppliers flexible terms, meaning that suppliers can either receive payment on the agreed value date, or can take the option to receive early payment on pre-agreed terms. “Even industries that have historically not been keen to look into early payment programmes are now starting to investigate what this means for them,” Mutter adds.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, Mutter argues that <a href="https://taulia.com/resources/blog/creating-a-sustainable-supply-chain/?utm_source=Partnerships&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=Q3-TT-Article-October-21&amp;utm_content=article&amp;utm_term=TT-October" target="_blank">supply chain finance has been proven to be a critical tool</a> for supporting global ecosystems, and has played a key role in injecting liquidity into supply chains when needed. By incentivising suppliers for good behaviour, it can also help companies achieve their ESG objectives: Mutter cites the example of Taulia’s client Bridgestone, which decided to offer suppliers preferential early payment financing rates based on the ESG rating of individual suppliers. “The better the rating, the greater the discount – so suppliers have the incentive to work on an enhanced sustainability rating,” he explains.</p>
<p>Looking further ahead, Mutter notes that inner city logistics is likely to be a greater area of focus. He cites Switzerland’s Cargo sous terrain (CST) project which aims to connect production and logistics sites with urban centres using electric autonomous vehicles travelling on an underground network.</p>
<p>“I think this is an opportunity to think bigger – how can we connect the last mile going forward? And how can we build more stable logistics in the suburbs?” says Mutter. “A lot of thinking, and a lot of investment, is going in this direction, and digitisation will play an important role in automating this.” Consequently, he says, Taulia is looking closely at this type of innovative project, “and at how we can intelligently customise our financing to these changed supply chains.”</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading">This issue’s question</h3>
<p><em>“How important is supply chain finance for companies; what are the implications of Greensill’s collapse on SCF?”</em></p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>At Metso Outotec we run one SCF programme for our large suppliers that utilises a programme run by Citi, and one for our smaller suppliers that uses C2FO’s dynamic discounting. The idea is that both programmes enable all our suppliers to obtain faster payments, improve their cash flow, liquidity, and DSO ratios. Rather than waiting for payment under our typical 90-day terms, under our SCF programme suppliers can get paid in ten days.</p>
<p>The Citi programme is global and run across Europe, North America, Australia, Brazil, China and India. The programme has increased in size and we are regularly onboarding new suppliers, especially since our merger as we are now onboarding ex-Outotec suppliers. We have also recently syndicated the programme, adding a couple more banks to the Citi programme to share the risks and diversify the portfolio. It has also allowed us to enlarge the programme with suppliers and countries.</p>
<p>Our SCF programme has a direct link to our strategy. Our aim is to continue to be an investment grade rated company, and SCF helps us to improve our working capital and cash flow with longer payment terms. It also allows us to deepen our supplier relationships by providing them with an opportunity to finance their receivables on good terms. Suppliers are interested in improving their cash flow, liquidity and ratios, and the programme provides them with a competitive financing option. Much of our procurement is from developing countries, where financing costs are typically higher. We have only ever utilised the Citi platform with SWIFT connectivity so have no experience of third party platforms.</p>
<p>The Greensill case has not directly impacted us, but I believe there may be indirect impacts, such as increased regulation and reporting requirements. I expect regulators will require companies to report their SCF exposure in their annual report. At Metso Outotec, we don’t externally report on the programme, but because we already report our SCF exposure internally, reporting externally wouldn’t be a big step if we were required to do so.</p>
<p>We have strict risk analysis underpinning the programme and have a limit to our overall exposure – a maximum amount that we won’t exceed. And our bank programme is not committed, so our banks can stop financing suppliers anytime if they want. If we didn’t offer a SCF programme, I assume many of our suppliers, now used to obtaining payments early, would start negotiating shorter payment terms. This would have an impact on our working capital and liquidity. SCF helps with our procurement and supplier relationships. It is a win-win for our suppliers and our treasury.</p>
<p>Another consequence of Greensill’s collapse could be that more large players such as global investment banks start financing supply chains, especially if investors grow wary of SCF, and start avoiding the asset class. The Greensill case will also make everyone involved in SCF more careful and prudent in selecting counterparties.</p>

<p>SCF, payables finance or reverse factoring, has been going on for years. It involves banks or lenders financing the gap between corporate buyers receiving goods from their suppliers, and the point the payment is due. SCF programmes are distributed amongst banks which manage the onboarding of suppliers onto their programmes.</p>
<p>Greensill was running traditional SCF programmes using Taulia’s technology platform. After Greensill’s collapse, Taulia secured financing from a consortium of banks led by J.P. Morgan which quickly picked up the invoice information and brought money to the table. Companies on the platform may suffer a slight delay to their funding cycle, but this is a small interruption for such a significant event. It proves the resilience of the product.</p>
<p>SCF in support of high quality, investment grade corporate supply chains are a good investment in terms of return on capital for banks, but it is low margin and needs scale. If lenders go down the value chain, they take on a higher risk and make a higher margin, but SCF as a product is not designed for this. SCF is about taking the best credit rated entity in the supply chain and shifting the funding cost of that entity down the supply chain, making it cheaper for small suppliers to access finance. When you have a poor rated entity at the top, suppliers down the chain don’t benefit as much because the gap between drawing on the SCF programme compared to other costs of borrowing reduces.</p>
<p>Greensill’s lending was also based on future receivables: this isn’t a trade finance product. Trade finance doesn’t intermediate the financing of a transaction that hasn’t happened – all trade finance products rely on the underlying trade documents being presented to the bank in order to get financed. Financing future receivables like Greensill was with GFG Alliance is straightforward lending that should have been priced appropriately.</p>
<p>Greensill’s collapse won’t have a huge impact on SCF. Most of the funders in the space are financial institutions that understand the risk. When they buy a SCF asset, they ensure any structure in place has ultimate access to the obligor and SCF assets are also sold under a trust structure. However, expect more investor scrutiny in terms of asset securitisation vehicles, or SPVs. Investors will look more closely at what makes up these assets, but this is a due diligence that should have been done anyway and is nothing to do with SCF.</p>
<p>Platform providers have an opportunity now. They provide visibility on what is being bought and a dashboard of flows and legal entities. Don’t expect more regulation of fintech providers. There may be a cause for more regulation for alternative lenders or shadow banks, but this depends on how systematic the risk is, and I believe Greensill does not pose a systematic risk.</p>
<p>It is incumbent on treasury teams to double check the strength of their underlying platform provider and reliability of their funders. They should check their quality, ability to onboard suppliers, and provide transparency. Elsewhere, treasury teams may face changes in accounting rules. Investors are increasingly calling on the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the International Accounting Standards Board for clarity on companies’ supply-chain finance programmes to ensure their true financial health of the buyer is disclosed.</p>

<p>The Greensill case has only directly impacted the companies that used Greensill’s SCF programme. But even here, other banks stepped in and Greensill’s SCF programmes for large corporates have been snapped up. Moreover, these companies will continue to use Taulia as their main technology provider.</p>
<p>However, companies using riskier SCF will see an impact. Rather than regular payables finance, Greensill was doing something different. It couldn’t make enough margin on standard SCF transactions, so it looked to corporate anchors with lower credit ratings and charged a higher margin from providing certainty to their suppliers. SCF is a low margin, big volume, sticky product. When you introduce platforms and asset managers wanting to get paid, or investors wanting yield, it can take on much higher risk.</p>
<p>Greensill got involved in future invoicing. This involves discounting the value of future receivables far into the future to lend money today, effectively allowing corporates to monetise future contracts. Greensill was taking on much greater risk than other lenders in the market by financing future trades that might never happen, based on the prediction that they will. No one is willing to do these kinds of trades for corporates now. There will always be investors in plain vanilla SCF, but returns are low.</p>
<p>Investors looking for yield will now ask more questions about what they are we investing in. Greensill shows that future receivables are a whole difference ball game, and investors will be cautious. Greensill’s structure saw SPVs mixed with various anchors and comprising different programmes, not just receivables but also future receivables. The danger comes when you mix up the anchor corporates and tell investors it is a great mix and put credit insurance on top. For this reason, structures around SPVs will change.</p>
<p>I don’t expect any scarcity in standard SCF, or pricing to increase. Most programmes comprise a large anchor with a technology provider or bank in a one-on-one relationship whereby the funders know what they are investing in. If they don’t know every supplier, they will have a note or structure that they know applies to that one buyer.</p>
<p>Investors and corporates will increasingly look to platforms for transparency around when payments are coming in, and payment trends. Technology providers have an opportunity to provide transparency so that anchor corporates, suppliers and funders all know exactly what is outstanding, and understand on an individual invoice level what they are financing.</p>
<p>SCF has two aspects of due diligence, one around the anchor and one around individual suppliers. Banks’ due diligence around anchors is good, but due diligence around a long tail of suppliers is more difficult. It involves more work and is a trade-off between the cost of onboarding and the benefits to lenders. It’s one of the reasons why KYC is always mentioned as a stumbling block to long tailed suppliers. The important thing is that plain vanilla SCF or paying confirmed invoices early is beneficial. It is a force for good, particularly for SMEs coming out of the pandemic.</p>

<p><img alt="C2FO logo" class="org" height="" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/logos/c2fo-logo-2021.svg?la=en&amp;hash=F0C2C0E7394DC2F66D51C1304D8A84B6" style="margin-top:1.5em;" title="C2FO logo" width="150"/></p>
<p>In business and finance, nothing ever remains the same. Today, a company may be in a strong cash position. A few months down the road, however, it may need to explore additional funding options. In tumultuous years like 2020, the fluctuations of business happen at an even faster pace. It makes the need for new systems free from antiquated financing programmes with static rates and covenants more imperative.</p>
<p>One focus is to help corporate supply chains generate the cash flow they need through early payment on their receivables. It’s a priority at <a href="https://c2fo.com/">C2FO</a>, where our digital platform connects the receivables and payables of more than one million organisations worldwide and has generated over US$110bn in early payment for supply chains.</p>
<p>Vendors are not the only ones who stand to benefit from greater control over working capital.</p>
<p>DCF also provides tools for enterprises to accelerate or extend payment of their own accounts receivable, allowing for more flexibility and a quicker response to changing market conditions. It enables companies to manage their receivables on a continuum, activating early invoice payment when they need to build more cash flow. Elsewhere, it means companies can accept later payment from customers (in exchange for a premium) at times when cash flow is already strong.</p>
<p>“Working capital is inherently dynamic and constantly subject to a variety of internal and external factors,” says Suneel Chirunomula, Managing Director for C2FO. “C2FO technology now provides a central platform to help corporates manage these conflicting factors on both sides of the balance sheet.”</p>
<p>DCF helps organisations and their customers manage working capital in three significant ways.</p>
<p><strong>1. Flexibility and control over receivables</strong></p>
<p>A company’s cash position may change depending on the time of year, economic factors and seasonal sales gaps. At times when a company needs more cash flow, it can use the C2FO platform to accelerate payment on invoices at mutually agreed pricing levels.</p>
<p>If a company has ample cash, it may find it beneficial to delay outstanding payments from customers. This could include extending payment on receivables, in exchange for an agreed-upon premium. In other words, a company will be paid more to be paid a little later, while the customer benefits from an enhance cash position.</p>
<p>No other technology platform exists that enables extended payment from customers without an awkward negotiation about a premium. But the C2FO platform makes the acceleration and extension of receivables simple, with just a few clicks on the online dashboard. This on-demand flexibility gives companies greater control over working capital and allows them to respond quickly to changes that affect the business.</p>
<p><strong>2. Companies can fund it themselves, or through a third party</strong></p>
<p>C2FO’s Dynamic Supplier Finance (DSF) solution gives corporates three options in managing their payables. They can fund the programme through their balance sheet, through an outside funding source in C2FO’s global network, or use a blend of both. DCF works the same way for companies’ accounts receivables that DSF works for payables. If a company wishes to extend payment from a customer, it can draw from its own cash, a third party, or a mix of the two.</p>
<p>This mechanism is especially useful in times of economic hardship. Recently, a US$20bn global IT and consulting company needed to eliminate risk on multi-million receivables from a cash-strapped, major retailer in the United States. C2FO was able to curate a solution through DCF, enlisting a funder from its network to purchase the unpaid receivables, freeing up cash flow for the corporate, reducing risk and allowing it to continue doing business with the US retailer.</p>
<p><strong>3. Use with C2FO’s other solutions</strong></p>
<p>C2FO provides a single technology platform with dynamic solutions to help companies of all sizes meet their working capital needs.</p>
<p>Companies can use C2FO to manage their AP and AR in the same on-demand way. They can utilise DSF to accelerate or extend payment to suppliers, using their own balance sheet or a third-party funder. Likewise, they can use DCF to easily manage receivables with any of their customers. With C2FO, there is no need for multiple financial portals or funding programmes.</p>
<p>Borealis AG, a chemicals company based in Austria, uses C2FO to pay suppliers early, at rates that meet their needs. But Borealis also uses DCF as a dynamic way to control its own cash and receivables on the C2FO platform.</p>
<p>“With C2FO, we provide our suppliers a platform to accelerate invoices: they reduce their cost of finance and we improve our margin and cash yield,” said Jan-Martin Nufer, Borealis VP of treasury and funding. “At the same time, we have also developed an innovative offer for selected customers: the opportunity for dynamic invoice extension.”</p>
<h4 id="more-benefits">More benefits</h4>
<p>Additional advantages of launching a DCF programme include the following:</p>
<p><strong>Customer connectivity</strong>: The DCF programme provides seamless reconciliation, collection and settlement with no delay and no negotiation.</p>
<p><strong>Stronger relationships</strong>: Offering a programme that can help companies’ customers with their own management of working capital can lead to greater trust and an improved relationship with that customer.</p>
<p><strong>Use it with any customer</strong>: C2FO provides access to early or delayed payment requests regardless of the customer. This can be accomplished through either a company’s own balance sheet or that of a C2FO funding partner.</p>
<p><strong>Penetration</strong>: the flexibility and control over cash flow that DCF provides leads to a higher participation rate among corporates and their customers.</p>
<h4 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h4>
<p>Companies’ trading partners need cash flow, especially in challenging economic times when banks and government programmes do not provide enough liquidity. However, large enterprises are not immune from market fluctuations and need to manage and protect their own cash positions.</p>
<p>DCF is an effective, flexible way for companies to manage their receivables in any economic environment, whether they need to be paid early to build cash flow or have the luxury of agreeing to be paid later in exchange for a premium. Third-party funding can be utilised when needed to mitigate risk and maintain customer relationships.</p>
<p>“We’re offering flexibility,” Chirunomula said. “There are times when you might say, ‘I have no intention of using my own cash at all because I want to preserve it.’ But a year from now, you may be facing a substantial cash surplus and you’ll have a different approach.”</p>
<p>In addition to other C2FO products like Dynamic Supplier Finance, DCF aids the management of working capital for everyone, regardless of where they are on a supply chain. And it’s all done from a single, easy-to-access digital platform.</p>

<h4 id="regional-trade-flows-disrupted-by-covid-19">Regional trade-flows disrupted by COVID-19</h4>
<p>These are uncertain times for companies all over Asia. Across the region, supply chains have been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, forcing production facilities to scale back operations. Many countries imposed export controls at the start of the pandemic, and some of these remain in place.</p>
<p>Ongoing disruption in the global aviation and shipping industries has compounded the situation, and some products which were formerly much in demand have seen their markets disrupted, as consumers, and national governments, have focused on securing essentials. A rise in regional geopolitical tensions has also had a dampening effect on trade, and now there is increasing nervousness about the global impact of a “second wave” of the virus.</p>
<h4 id="are companies hoarding cash">Are companies hoarding cash?</h4>
<p>COVID-19 is testing the resolve of even the most efficient companies, including those which habitually pay their suppliers on time. Companies are doing whatever it takes to preserve liquidity. Unfortunately, delaying payments to suppliers is a route that some companies have opted to take. They will have looked at their supplier lists and made some internal ranking decisions about which relationships are the most important – ie those suppliers which must be paid on time, and those which can wait.</p>
<p>Jarrod Shandley, Co-Head of Product at RapidRatings in Brisbane says: “We have not seen significant signs of cash hoarding since COVID-19. In the prior four quarters, company cash balances on average went up 6.2% per quarter, while in the quarter following COVID-19 we saw an average cash balance increase of 9.0%. This is certainly an increase, but we also know that many companies raised capital or drew down debt during the quarter, so these numbers are as expected. In fact, many of our clients with global supply chains have been accelerating payments to suppliers to keep their operations flowing”.</p>
<h4 id="prompt-payment-is-a-differentiator-in-business">Prompt payment is a differentiator in business</h4>
<p>The best-managed companies understand the negative consequences of paying suppliers late and know that prompt payment of suppliers can be a very useful differentiator in business. It can be used as a tool which provides considerable leverage, for example to motivate suppliers to improve their performance. Suppliers are far more likely to want to do more business with prompt payers than with those who have a history of doing the opposite.</p>
<p>Singapore-based Leon Scott, MD, Regional Head Asia Pacific Japan and Middle East at TradeIX notes: “We have certainly seen examples of companies using COVID-19 as an excuse to delay payment, even when cash is available. Equally, and admirably, there are many examples of companies exploring every way possible to speed up payments to suppliers, even if it requires using their own balance sheet to do so. Some of the most vulnerable are the most critical, and sensible companies know this”.</p>
<h4 id="the-impact-of-late-payments">The impact of late payments</h4>
<p>Late payments to suppliers really are the scourge of the supply chain and cause more disruption and damage to supplier/customer relationships than any other single risk factor. Below are some of the effects:</p>
<p>Stress in the supply chain – when a customer delays payment to a supplier, there is an immediate impact on that supplier, who will have a cash flow shortfall that needs to be covered. When a supplier is under pressure to meet its financial obligations, there can be a ripple effect through the whole supply chain – ie downstream providers of goods and services may well feel the impact of the customer’s action too.</p>
<p>Damage to supplier relationships – delayed payments cause tensions in the supplier/customer relationship. They also make the supplier less likely to want to continue future business dealings. It is vital in these situations that both parties maintain dialogue. The track record between the two parties is key here, as is honesty in the communications. Shandley notes that supply chains are more interdependent than ever before: “The pandemic has illustrated, in stark terms, that the financial health of any given company is heavily influenced by the health of the third-party suppliers that you’re doing business with. Companies of all sizes must collaborate in real terms and with real transparency. You can’t extend favourable terms or get payments in advance unless you have a conversation with your third parties”.</p>
<p>Access to funding becomes more difficult – businesses which regularly make late payments to their suppliers are likely to see their standing in the eyes of their banks diminish. Banks will see this as a possible warning sign which, in turn, may make the bank less willing to provide support to that business. At the very least, the bank may decide to raise the pricing on its credit facilities. Suppliers who experience regular delays in receiving payments may find that this has a negative impact on their credit rating, thereby making it harder to obtain bank financing.</p>
<p>Negative publicity – unhappy suppliers may take to social media to shame a company that isn’t paying them on time. Companies must communicate effectively with their employees in such situations and train them in how to respond appropriately to complaints or criticism from suppliers.</p>
<h4 id="internal-measures-to-protect-cash-flow">Internal measures to protect cash flow</h4>
<p>COVID-19 has forced many businesses in Asia to change the way they operate. Consequently, companies need to re-examine and refine their internal processes with a view to preserving maximum liquidity. Here are some practical measures to consider:</p>
<p>Keep on top of process changes – in normal times invoice settlement delays often occur purely because of inefficiency – weak internal processes, lack of automation, administrative errors or poor cash flow management, for example. COVID-19 brings new challenges, as staff in accounts payable may be working from home and invoices may need to be routed to new email addresses. Issuance of purchase order numbers may be subject to a new process. Companies should be contacting their customers to find out if there have been changes at their end. And if a company has changed its own processes as a result of COVID-19, it should make sure its customers are aware of these too.</p>
<p>Follow up on outstanding invoices very actively – now more than ever, companies need to maintain regular contact with customers, following up on outstanding invoices even before their due date, to make sure that any issues or queries that might delay receipt of payment are resolved. Companies need to ensure that their invoices are at the top of the pile for payment and should refine their internal processes for making this happen.</p>
<p>Credit limits and watch lists – companies should be on the lookout for early warning signals that could mean there is a likelihood of future bad debts, and keeping on top of credit limits, thereby ensuring they are in a position to react as risk levels change. Customers in high risk sectors should be monitored closely and appropriate watch lists maintained.</p>
<p>Credit extensions – allowances may need to be made for customers operating in sectors which have been hardest hit by the virus. Careful thought will need to be given about agreeing payment plans or granting extended terms to customers who are really struggling. Effective internal communication between credit control, sales and service is essential here.</p>
<p>Unpaid invoices – credit control should have a clear and well-documented escalation path for addressing situations where it is clear that invoices will not be paid. Bear in mind that there is every likelihood that legal proceedings to recover debt will be significantly delayed as a result of COVID-19.</p>
<h4 id="growing-interest-in-supply-chain-finance-solutions">Growing interest in supply chain finance solutions</h4>
<p>Having considered the impact on suppliers of late payments, what can be done to speed up the whole payment process? One solution lies in the continuing development, and scaling, of supply chain finance (SCF) solutions – using new technology it is increasingly going to be possible for smaller suppliers to gain access to SCF.</p>
<p>Instead of using a corporate balance sheet to pay suppliers early, SCF is a well-known and popular solution which enables the buyer and supplier to disconnect the buyer payment date from the supplier collection date with a funder, typically a bank, bridging the gap. When structured correctly and implemented for the right reasons, it provides significant low-cost working capital benefits to both a buyer and their suppliers. A supplier is usually happy to forfeit a small discount to receive their payment early as the cost of doing so is calculated based on their customer’s usually stronger credit rating.</p>
<p>TradeIX have considerable expertise in this area, and Scott provides some thoughts on the way forward for SCF in Asia: “Popularity in SCF solutions always increases further during times of crisis as working capital and cash become an even higher priority than usual. SCF is not as widely adopted for large corporate buyers in Asia as in Europe and the US, but the level of interest in SCF in Asia since the start of the pandemic, in particular in Japan, suggests this is changing rapidly”.</p>
<p>SCF programmes have historically had a very narrow scope, only benefiting larger, strategic suppliers. Commenting on why smaller businesses, which desperately need the cash during times of crisis, have not been able to get on board and access the solutions developed to support them, Scott says: “This limitation stems from a lack of automation with the technology used (ie manual, human processes) and lengthy compliance and know your customer (KYC) requirements, which are different for every bank. It is not that smaller suppliers cannot be onboarded, it is that the combination of these two constraints makes the average cost to onboard a small supplier too high to warrant doing so and they are left behind. An SCF programme also creates a parallel accounts payable and payment process for the buyer – creating additional manual work required to process and reconcile back to the company’s enterprise resource planning (ERP) system”.</p>
<p>Scott notes that a clear, emerging trend is corporates looking for a single supplier payment solution for their entire supply chain needs and connected to their ERP – large and small suppliers, indirect and direct spend, early payment and on-time payment. He adds: “Suppliers need a secure and private lens into the buyer’s accounts payable process – approval, payment and remittance, offsets, the ability to easily reconcile back to their own ERP system and there needs to be an early payment option to all suppliers, supported by the corporate’s panel of banks”.</p>
<p>The key is (i) the latest cutting-edge technology and (ii) using different funding structures for different supplier groups. Combined, this drives standardisation, simplification and automation, removing expensive human-led processes. Automation drives down cost significantly and enables the scaling of SCF programmes, and thereby the inclusion of new suppliers for the first time.</p>

<p><img alt="C2FO logo" class="org" height="" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/logo/c2fo-logo-2018-65x21.png?la=en&amp;hash=325C4C112FB4A3725A7046C4BB7A08DC" title="C2FO logo" width="80"/></p>
<p>Supply chain finance (SCF) has been around for more than four decades and continues to be a popular funding model for corporates and their strategic partners. A new form of supplier finance blends SCF capabilities with early payment options, creating a flexible, versatile funding source. Dynamic Supplier Finance (DSF) from <a href="https://c2fo.com/">C2FO</a> enables suppliers of all sizes to easily accelerate invoices from their customers on demand. </p>
<p>The platform provides corporates with increased flexibility, with the ability to seamlessly toggle early payment between balance sheets and other funding sources, giving control over how and when they fund their suppliers’ invoices. By paying suppliers early — with their own funds or through a third party — corporates can provide critical liquidity to their supply chains while still preserving their cash. This enables more suppliers, from the largest to the smallest, to access early payment.</p>
<h4 id="flexibility-and-empowerment">Flexibility and empowerment</h4>
<p>Supply chain finance is an effective way for very large corporates to provide liquidity to suppliers, particularly a select number of their largest vendors. An SCF programme enables suppliers to accelerate invoices at a fixed rate determined by their customer. Also known as reverse factoring, SCF is typically initiated by the corporate customer in collaboration with a bank.</p>
<p>Like other traditional SCF programmes, the platform allows suppliers to select the customer invoices they wish to accelerate but it also enables them to determine the discount to offer on each one. The offers are approved automatically, based on parameters from the customer. This flexibility ensures that funding is always available, leading to greater participation among suppliers.</p>
<p>Additionally, SCF programmes can require extensive paperwork, burdensome set-ups and are often only available to select, tier-one vendors. In contrast, all transactions through DSF are digital, with zero paperwork, KYC verifications or other time-consuming documentation.</p>
<p>The platform differs from traditional bank financing by engaging suppliers of all sizes – from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to large companies, with competitive pricing while placing no restrictions on spending. That means more of the company’s suppliers (20 times, on average) can access early payment through the platform than through static SCF models. This eliminates the effort needed to segment suppliers, as this happens automatically when suppliers name their rates through the platform.</p>
<h4 id="the-benefits-of-early-payment-programmes">The benefits of early payment programmes</h4>
<p>Today, many companies worldwide participate in early payment programmes which can add value through generating greater working capital. Here are a few examples of how early payment through DSF can add value:</p>
<p><strong>Control</strong></p>
<ul><li><p>The platform puts corporates in the driver’s seat, enabling them to toggle between self-funding and funding from partners as their working capital needs change. The multi-bank finance model reduces risk and dependency, with no bank rules, mandates or funding disruptions. The supplier is never affected by the nuances of who pays and the programme evolves as the corporate sees fit.</p></li></ul>
<p><strong>Flexibility</strong></p>
<ul><li><p>Suppliers have an always-on funding option. That flexibility drives greater usage and provides a valuable benefit to suppliers’ financial health. C2FO also works with corporates to source funding for as little cost as possible, enabling them to leverage alternative banking groups or funding partners within a day if needed.</p></li></ul>
<h4 id="the-supply-chain-as-a-strategic-asset">The supply chain as a strategic asset</h4>
<p>The supply chain is the corporate’s most strategic asset. Ensuring always-on funding for suppliers means greater support and stability across all levels. For example, a major retailer with more than US$130bn in revenue and over 7,000 eligible suppliers, wants to enhance its well-established early payment programme with additional solutions. </p>
<p>The large retailer’s needs are addressed with a combination of dynamic discounting (DD) and DSF. This enables flat or dynamic pricing for suppliers that is funded from the company’s balance sheet or a funding partner, with the ability to turn funding on or off at any time. The flexibility of using its own balance sheet or a third-party funder enables the retailer to provide suppliers with working capital while also realising EBITDA and margin improvements from the programme. The retail company can leverage alternative banking groups or funding partners within a day if needed.</p>
<h4 id="funding-for-turbulent-times">Funding for turbulent times</h4>
<p>Corporates want to protect their business and their supply chain, regardless of what’s happening in the market. The platform provides companies with the flexibility to support suppliers through early payment, while staying mindful of their own liquidity and keeping their business well-capitalised, an important factor to consider in today’s economic environment.</p>
<p>DSF provides protection from economic volatility by keeping viable cash on the balance sheet and investing in suppliers. It’s an integrated and flexible funding option for companies that are eager to support suppliers through the early payment system, but may not want to tap into their own cash reserves.</p>
<p>Countless companies have faced financial pressure from the economic effects of COVID-19. 
 For SMEs worldwide, cash flow has stagnated, illuminating the need for cohesive strategies that open up access to working capital. It’s important to remember that keeping suppliers’ liquidity flowing helps organisations to thrive. Capital is crucial for businesses of all sizes to emerge successfully when the storm has passed.</p>
<h4 id="the-rising-importance-of-esg">The rising importance of ESG</h4>
<p>Most large corporates today have a focus on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) agendas. C2FO supports these initiatives, providing financial inclusion for all suppliers in the supply chain.  Linking preferential funding rates with supplier performance against ESG initiatives provides strong motivation for suppliers and in turn it helps corporates to deliver against their own ESG goals.</p>
<h4 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h4>
<p>The platform offers a flexible early payment programme for corporates and their suppliers. 
Unlike SCF programmes, the corporate is in complete control of managing working capital across their supply chain. From managing KPIs by funding only intra-quarter payables to utilising the programme to address shareholder interests, the technology combines the power of the corporate’s liquidity with funding from banks to help them pay on their terms while strengthening their supply chains.</p>

<p><img alt="PrimeRevenue logo" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/logo/primerevenue-vector-logo.png?la=en&amp;hash=75E4CF591CA384D6BF4060A91392CAEC" width="170"/></p>
<p><em>Supply chain finance can be a powerful cash flow and growth-acceleration tool for corporate buyers. Alongside the supportive measure of the EU’s Late Payment Directive, SME suppliers are beginning to see it as a potential lifesaver too.</em></p>
<p>When opportunity knocks, Sebastian Zegocki, Managing Director of specialist transport company, Brit-Pol, knows when to open the door. As soon as his company was presented with the chance to join its customer’s supply chain finance (SCF) programme, it made its move and has never looked back.</p>
<p>The company has grown rapidly from a single truck to 65 trucks in four years, Zegocki explains. “It was foreseen that this growth needed to be financed properly and, as we expect continued growth, the decision was taken to look into SCF.”</p>
<p>Having seen how SCF could help meet the company’s needs, Zegocki describes the on-boarding process – and the requirements made of the business to be able to participate – as “quite straightforward”. Brit-Pol has an established track record and good credit history, he explains. “We were not asked to do anything different in order to participate as our invoices are raised under a self-billing regime.”</p>
<p>Today, he reports that the programme is meeting Brit-Pol’s needs “very well”. Indeed, he confirms that the cash being received is being re-invested into the business “to improve our facilities and infrastructure”. The help provided by PrimeRevenue, he adds, “has been invaluable in this process”.</p>
<p>However, at a broader level, PrimeRevenue is concerned that with the late payment Directive, suppliers like Brit-Pol would not have the option for early payment with SCF. The vendor’s unique SCF solution is thus an essential part of its clients’ growth plans.</p>
<h4 id="positive-disruption">Positive disruption</h4>
<p>Why PrimeRevenue’s approach to SCF is seen as a disruptive intervention in this market is obvious to Hana Ferklova, Regional Vice President of Legal &amp; Compliance, EMEA at PrimeRevenue.</p>
<p>“Our approach to supply chain finance is different from many of our competitors. First and foremost, we rely on multiple sources of funding whereas other providers often rely on a single source,” she explains.</p>
<p>Indeed, in many cases it is the bank that is acting as provider, and more often than not, that institution has limitations on which geographies and currencies it supports. “Several years ago, we saw many banks scale back their SCF operations in Central Europe,” notes Ferklova. “The net result was that organisations faced significant funding gaps in their SCF programmes. That dealt a blow not just to the organisations running the programmes, but also to the suppliers who participated in them that had come to rely on SCF to accelerate cash flow. Our customers don’t have to worry about that.”</p>
<p>The reason is simple. PrimeRevenue currently has over 100 funders on its platform. This means that it is able to extend the benefits of SCF “to more suppliers in more geographies using more currencies than any other provider”.</p>
<p>Another way PrimeRevenue is disrupting the market is by bringing SCF to organisations that have historically been overlooked, adds Ferklova. This includes small and mid-sized businesses as well as companies with sub-investment grade credit ratings. As she rightly points out, these organisations are often the ones that need cash flow improvements the most.</p>
<h4 id="wider-benefit">Wider benefit</h4>
<p>SCF programmes effectively have benefits for both buyers and suppliers. Buyers use it to strengthen their supply chain or to accelerate their cash flow by extending payment terms, in the latter case knowing that SCF programmes create opportunities for suppliers to mitigate the impact of payment terms changes, if desired.</p>
<p>For suppliers, SCF is a powerful tool that can be used for planning (giving cash flow predictability) or to receive early payment by a funder (ensuring cash flow optimisation), all without the balance sheet impact. “In short, SCF is a win-win for both parties,” comments Ferklova.</p>
<p>PrimeRevenue SCF programmes are structured to derive maximum value for users. Its multi-funder approach translates into all the above benefits. But, says Ferklova, PrimeRevenue also delivers benefits not offered by competition.</p>
<p>She explains that using its best practices, PrimeRevenue implements and onboards fast, and yet its programmes are backed up by a comprehensive legal framework. In addition, PrimeRevenue’s programmes utilise an advanced system that benefits from a continued focus on innovation. Our system, she notes, is “robust” with “unparalleled security” and “first-class” user support.</p>
<p>“In short, we provide an outstanding experience and push further than anyone else in the industry to provide greater opportunity to succeed, for both buyers and suppliers, in optimising their cash flow.”</p>
<h4 id="the-need-for-a-more-supportive-regulatory-environment">The need for a more supportive regulatory environment</h4>
<p>Adopted on 16th February 2011, the Directive 2011/7/EU (on combating late payment in commercial transactions, also known as the ‘Late Payment Directive’ or ‘LPD’) is intended to help suppliers optimise their cash flow. It introduced mandated payment terms and penalties for late payment in commercial transactions and required the member states to reflect the regulation locally. As a result, in number of EU jurisdictions, the local regulation now dictates that in commercial relationships all suppliers get paid in 60 days (or 30 or even 15 in certain circumstances), unless the customer-supplier relationship qualifies for an exception recognised under applicable law.</p>
<p>This may appear to be good news for suppliers, but deeper inspection reveals a downside. As it stands currently, if implemented restrictively, the LPD regulation unintentionally harms those suppliers that rely on SCF to accelerate cash flow. Ferklova says, “there is little doubt that LPD is designed to protect European businesses, but it also discourages companies from offering SCF programmes to their suppliers”.</p>
<p>The scenario she presents is compelling. Thousands of European businesses rely on SCF programmes to get paid early (often immediately) for their products and services. If they were to rely solely on the LPD regime, suppliers that are used to getting paid on day two or ten would get paid on day 30 or 60. That could be devastating to suppliers that rely on fast access to liquidity provided by SCF to invest in innovation, manage seasonal demand or navigate fluctuations in the market.</p>
<p>This makes the case for regulators to take a different view of SCF.</p>
<p>“It is very likely that suppliers would wish to continue using the SCF solution, with or without the restrictive measure in place,” comments Ferklova. But there is a risk that restrictive implementation of LPD could negatively impact the availability of SCF solutions to suppliers in Europe. If the intent is to help small or medium-sized business grow, driving SCF solutions out of the EU market would not achieve the goal.</p>
<p>Ferklova asks what would happen if the law restricted any payment term extensions in the manner described in the example above, with no exceptions allowed? “The ability to unlock cash via SCF and use it to invest in growth and innovation would be materially impacted as a result, for both buyers and suppliers,” she states.</p>
<p>Buyers wouldn’t be able to extend payment terms beyond the mandated number of days, and their appetite to support the availability of SCF solutions would inevitably drop. As a result, only a limited number of SCF solutions would be available to suppliers, if any.</p>
<p>“That’s a big deal,” states Ferklova. “As our colleagues at Brit-Pol have shown, SCF gives suppliers an easy, low-cost way to fund strategic growth objectives that are often incredibly expensive.”</p>
<p>This is true for Kiddyum, a small UK-based food manufacturer that would have struggled to fulfill orders for a major client – one of the country’s largest grocery chains – without SCF. Indeed, it was only its participation in that customer’s SCF programme that enabled it to accelerate its cash flow, which in turn enabled it to expand production to meet the growing demand of its customer. Without SCF, notes Ferklova, these suppliers would have had to turn to “less dependable, more costly, and non-immediate sources of liquidity” to grow their businesses and remain competitive.</p>
<h4 id="maintaining-the-power">Maintaining the power</h4>
<p>LPD certainly has its place in combating late payments in commercial transactions in Europe. However, the intended reach of the regulation itself, and the approach to its implementation, must be carefully evaluated; market participants must not be negatively impacted and their opportunities for growth supported not impaired. For Ferklova, the implications of insensitive implementation of LPD “could be dire and the impacts devastating”, particularly for the SMEs that it aims to protect.</p>
<p>SCF has the power to accelerate cash flow to fund strategic growth initiatives for all suppliers, regardless of geography, currency and size. It can do so without burdening them in the process. SCF is thus perfectly positioned to complement the efforts and help achieve the objectives of the LPD, supporting employment, growth, and an improvement in the liquidity of European businesses, including SMEs.</p>
<p>“Let’s hope that the current EC initiatives aimed at evaluating the potential benefits of SCF for European businesses and the European economy bear fruit, and the resulting regulatory environment enables European businesses to grow and succeed”, concludes Ferklova.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>Increasing supply chain efficiency is a priority for companies around the world. What role can treasurers play in addressing the pain points – and how is technology supporting the adoption of more efficient practices?</em></p>
<p> While the topic of supply chain efficiency is nothing new, the pressures and challenges which arise within supply chains evolve over time. Supply chains, by definition, involve multiple companies – and with companies operating on a more global basis than in the past, the potential delays and obstacles that can arise within those supply chains are considerable.</p>
<h3 id="new-sales-models">New sales models</h3>
<p>One notable development is the rise of new sales models and the impact this may have on payments. Luc Belpaire, Head of Product Management and Business Development, Trax, FIS points out that the move towards eCommerce models means that just-in-time delivery and zero inventory practices becoming more prevalent. As Belpaire observes, these practices ultimately affect the financial supply chain – meaning that treasurers need to understand how they can capture the equivalent financial transactions.</p>
<p>“Those supply chains are getting more compressed and more real-time, which means there is a requirement for real-time settlement scenarios,” says Belpaire. “They need real-time insights into when goods are being delivered, and delivery against payments.”</p>
<p>Consequently, Belpaire says that treasurers need to investigate what the options are, including considering the adoption of new real-time instruments. “If a real-time payment instrument is selected, they need a real-time communication channel with the bank to help facilitate the real-time payment and that is where open APIs comes to play,” he says. He notes that treasurers need to “be an advisor to the supply chain and rest of the business on how the company could potentially adopt these new real-time payment methods in order to keep up with the supply chain models.”</p>
<h3 id="supply-chain-finance-and-the-financial-supply-chain">Supply chain finance and the financial supply chain</h3>
<p>For corporate treasurers, one area of focus is the financial supply chain, which incorporates the flow of cash and information relating to payments. Companies may have opportunities to improve their working capital positions by increasing the efficiency of these processes.</p>
<p>“There is always more to be squeezed out of the supply chain,” comments Peter Jameson, Managing Director, Co-Head EMEA Product Management, Global Transaction Services at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. He notes that since the financial crisis, there has been a greater recognition that companies can free up significant amounts of working capital by focusing more closely on this topic. “What I’ve seen is that a lot of corporates realise they can put specific numbers against the working capital enhancement that they can generate,” he says. “Those numbers resonate, because they correlate with the amount that companies would otherwise need to borrow from the market”.</p>
<p>Different techniques are available to treasurers looking to drive financial supply chain improvements. Greg Person, Vice President Global Presales and Strategic Value at Kyriba, says that transparency is key to optimising both the physical and the financial supply chain, noting that where the latter is concerned, inefficiencies can arise if suppliers do not have visibility over the status of their invoices once they have been submitted. “While it sounds simple, this transparency is often not implemented properly, especially by larger organisations with different procurement systems and IT systems,” he comments. Person points out that once this level of transparency has been achieved, companies may have the opportunity to take advantage of early payment discounts, either on an automated or on-demand basis.</p>
<p>Indeed, treasurers increasingly recognise that solutions such as supply chain finance can drive working capital improvements by enabling suppliers to receive payment sooner than they otherwise would. Such solutions can also reduce the risk that supply chain disruptions could have a negative impact on the buyer’s business.</p>
<p>As such, supply chain finance has become increasingly mainstream in recent years. Jameson says that the benefits of a supply chain finance programme are becoming better understood beyond large corporations. “One of the big areas of development is that there are different tools out there to provide the same outcome,” he says. “When you look at using supply chain finance for smaller suppliers, it’s a bit like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. So, for example, we’re talking to a lot of companies about the benefits of a purchasing card programme, and the possibility of combining this with supply chain finance.”</p>
<p>Jameson adds that a combination of these two solutions can address the needs of both large suppliers, as well as the “long tail” of smaller suppliers. “I guess that’s the next evolution: looking at other tools to achieve that working capital benefit, but in a lighter-touch way for the smaller suppliers.”</p>
<h3 id="role-of-the-treasurer">Role of the treasurer</h3>
<p>Person says that supply chain inefficiencies are becoming an increasingly major focus for CFOs, corporate controllers – and corporate treasurers. “For treasurers who have a broader role in the working capital strategy or liquidity strategy for their firm, they may be the one who is tasked with executing and operating a free cash flow target,” he explains. “Or treasurers may have a lot of debt on their balance sheet and be trying to optimise their cash position in order to pay down debt.”</p>
<h4 id="collaboration-within-the-organisation">Collaboration within the organisation</h4>
<p>That said, supply chain is not a topic that comes solely under the treasurer’s remit: it also involves looking at procurement and considering the contracts and agreements that the buyer has with suppliers. “So it does involve a collaborative cross-functional type of project which the treasurer can champion and initiate,” says Person.</p>
<p>This may involve overcoming some practical obstacles. In the past, treasury and procurement – and indeed treasury and sales – have tended to be positioned separately within the organisation. However, this can result in a certain disconnect when it comes to supply chain efficiency, hampering the organisation’s ability to drive improvements.</p>
<p>For example, the use of a purchasing card programme to extend payment terms to 60 days might be wholly valid from the treasurer’s point of view – but this will only succeed if the procurement team is equipped to explain the benefits and mechanics of the solution to suppliers. Likewise, where sales is concerned, treasurers may see the working capital efficiency gains that could be generated by asking customers to pay sooner – but they may not be aware of credit conditions in specific countries and the competitive threats that may arise if another company offers better credit.</p>
<p>This gap is closing up, however, and Jameson says he is increasingly seeing greater connectivity between those groups. “Whether procurement reports into treasury, or whether they sit alongside each other will vary hugely – but there’s a much greater need for them to collaborate in order to drive success,” he says.</p>
<h4 id="working-capital-champion">Working capital champion</h4>
<p>In many cases, companies opt to appoint a working capital champion, such as a chief working capital officer, who may report directly to the CFO. “The purpose of that is to try and tie these strands together,” says Jameson. “If you think about it, the treasurer’s job of optimising working capital is heavily dependent on the level of efficiency within the procurement process, or equally in the management of the sales process and how much credit is being extended to customers.” Consequently, some companies are “putting in senior leadership between those functions to bring them together, because it’s only when you start looking across all those components that you really see the working capital benefit”.</p>
<p>Belpaire adds that treasury is partnering with sales and procurement in order to drive process efficiencies throughout the entire financial supply chain, in areas such as collections and dispute management, in order to help free up working capital. He adds: “Real-time access to data and collaboration are key components to providing much needed improvements across the supply chain. Some of these improvements are achieved through accurate predictions of future collection risk of each customer, customer portals for immediate self-service payments, as well as early identification and resolution of deductions and disputes.”</p>
<h4 id="what-about-inventory">What about inventory?</h4>
<p>While treasurers have a clear role to play in optimising DSO and DPO, they tend to have less of a role in optimising the other component of the cash conversion cycle, days inventory outstanding (DIO). However, this may be changing too.</p>
<p>“When I was in treasury, I worked for a medical device company – we were looking at how much inventory was kept in sales people’s cars,” explains Person. He points out that while not all treasurers will have the opportunity to get involved in this area, their involvement can bring certain benefits for the company: “Treasury may not be able to own the area of inventory management, but they may be able to expose it as an area for analysis and optimisation, and an opportunity to improve the organisation’s liquidity position.”</p>
<h3 id="future-developments">Future developments</h3>
<p>This area continues to evolve, bringing both new challenges and new opportunities. One pain point relates to KYC documentation and the increasing burden associated with this. “A lot of compliance and regulation goes into the suppliers that the bank will pay on behalf of the buyer, so there’s a lot of due diligence from a banking standpoint when on-boarding those suppliers,” explains Person. “That can be a barrier to adoption – if the process is too challenging or onerous for suppliers, you won’t see the level of adoption you are looking for, which means that the value proposition of the programme is diluted.”</p>
<p>This is an area that supply chain finance vendors are actively working on, however. Person says that Kyriba is spending time and effort on R&amp;D to build more integrated and simpler on-boarding tools which allow suppliers to opt into programmes and rapidly be onboarded. “This involves not just the fintech side of things, but also the bank documentation and how this component can be digitised, making it simpler, faster, more transparent and ultimately easier for suppliers to participate in these programmes,” he explains.</p>
<p>Jameson notes that another interesting trend is the move in certain industries towards selling directly to consumers. “That is going to place very different pressures on the organisation, because if you are dealing with a large distributor your payment terms – and hence the whole working capital dynamic around that – is very different from if you are selling to individuals,” he points out.</p>
<h4 id="building-on-blockchain">Building on blockchain</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, much has been said about the potential use of blockchain technology to support international trade by building trust between trading partners and facilitating new financing opportunities. Notable developments include last year’s launch of we.trade, a platform developed by a consortium of banks to connect the different parties involved in a trade transaction. Where supply chain finance is concerned, Kyriba’s Person says that the company is currently working on its blockchain strategy, with prototypes currently in place in areas including supply chain finance and treasury management.</p>
<h4 id="supply-chain-performance-as-collateral">Supply chain performance as collateral</h4>
<p>Finally, Enrico Camerinelli, Senior Analyst at Aite Group, says that he is seeing increasing interest in the idea of using companies’ supply chain performance as additional collateral to secure payments. “The model of just relying on the large anchor company that guarantees the whole system works is still there, but it has to be integrated with another manner of assessing the credit profile of companies you want to finance,” he explains. “By using supply chain performance as collateral, you can use technologies like AI, predictive analytics and data analysis to take the huge amount of data that is exchanged between partners and, for example, anticipate the reliability that a supplier has with its customer.”</p>

<h3 id="3d-printing">3D printing</h3>
<p>Among the new technologies set to improve supply chain processes, one of the more intriguing is the use of 3D printing. Notable developments in this area include GE’s success in deploying metal printing to create fuel nozzles for jet engines, resulting in shorter lead times – and higher fuel efficiency, as the 3D printed item weighs 25% less than its predecessors.</p>
<p>While only certain products can be printed in this way, 3D printing – or additive manufacturing, as it is also known – offers the opportunity for certain components to be distributed digitally. “3D printing definitely allows companies to dematerialise inventories and digitise the supply chain, because instead of manufacturing and shipping certain items, you can just send the file,” comments Camerinelli. “While this might be limited in scope, it revolutionises the whole supply chain paradigm when you don’t have any inventory.”</p>



<h2 class="h3 copy__heading">Supporting collaboration </h2>
Enrico Camerinelli, Senior Analyst at Aite Group, argues that the biggest issue that companies face in increasing the efficiency of their supply chains lies in collaborating more effectively with their supply chain partners. However, various obstacles can impede this collaboration in different ways.
<p>The first of these is the issue of connecting disparate systems when different areas are separated into silos. “The second is the issue of data privacy,” he says. “If you want to share some data with some and not with others, how can you manage that?” A further obstacle, Camerinelli adds, is that “nobody wants to be the first” to adopt new methods of collaborating.</p>
<p>However, these obstacles are not insurmountable. Camerinelli says that innovation in areas such as blockchain can help with some of these issues. “If everybody has their own system, that is perfectly legitimate in a blockchain world because data is shared using distributed ledgers,” he comments. Data privacy can likewise be addressed by the cryptography used in distributed ledgers, or by the use of private blockchains. And when it comes to the need for common standards, Camerinelli cites the work done by global business communications standards organisation GS1 to support the adoption of blockchain.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>When companies are under cost pressure, efficient working capital management shoots up the agenda. For many corporations, that is the case today. However, as any treasury team that has embarked on a working capital efficiency project will attest, driving significant and lasting change is no easy feat.</p>
<p>The reasons for this are multi-faceted and will vary slightly from company to company. However, one thing that is consistent across all organisations is that working capital is a truly cross-functional area, requiring treasury to align all disparate departments with different aims and objectives.</p>
<p>Whilst many of the challenges are largely organisational in nature, it is technology and data that hold the answer to solving them. And as we will discover, new solutions are not only enabling treasury teams to better manage working capital – they are also allowing treasury to play an increasingly pivotal role in shaping the future commercial success of the business.</p>
<h3 id="funding-shifting-business-models">Funding shifting business models</h3>
<p>The impact that technology is having more broadly on companies is, in part, driving a renewed focus on working capital. As Michael Vrontamitis, Head of Trade, Europe and Americas at Standard Chartered explains: “The transition to the digital economy is forcing businesses to drastically change their business models. To fund this transformation, organisations are looking to drive out costs and release working capital tied up in the business.”</p>
<p>Achieving this is proving difficult for the world’s top organisations. The Hackett Group’s most recent analysis of the world’s biggest companies’ working capital performance highlights this, indicating that the working capital performance of companies in Asia, Europe and the US is slipping or remaining static (see box for more detailed analysis). Consequently, trillions of dollars remain locked up in working capital around the world.</p>
<p>Across all regions, much of the improvement corporations are making is coming about through changes in the management of days payables outstanding (DPO). “There are numerous strategies that can be employed and they are relatively easy to execute,” says Vrontamitis. “In Europe and the US, the most popular strategies are to push out supplier payment terms and utilise supply chain finance (SCF) solutions. This is also becoming more common in Asia.”</p>
<p>Whilst lots of corporates have realised significant improvements using these solutions, The Hackett Group claim in its latest reports that the use of targeted SCF programmes is only likely to deliver short-term success. Significant and lasting success only comes from a more holistic working capital efficiency strategy that tackles all aspects of the working capital cycle.</p>
<h3 id="lessons-from-the-best">Lessons from the best</h3>
<p>US-headquartered technology giant HP Inc. is a company that can claim to be world-class when it comes to working capital management. Zac Nesper, Head of Finance and Assistant Treasurer, says this is down to an all-encompassing C-level project the company launched several years ago to become best in class in this space. The project not only involved implementing new solutions but also completely changing the culture of the organisation.</p>
<p>“Historically we were a very P&amp;L focused organisation,” explains Nesper. “This doesn’t necessarily correlate with strong working capital performance, especially when we start talking about changing payment terms of suppliers and customers are involved. Key to our success has therefore been pivoting the focus towards cash flow and ensuring that cash is being considered for in every business decision.”</p>
<p>A natural consequence of this pivot has been the growing presence of treasury in discussions around sales and procurement. “We are involved in frequent and in-depth discussions with our colleagues in both departments to ensure we carefully analyse the impact different strategies have on sales/purchases and cash flow to make sure we do what is best for the business,” says Nesper. “We also work together when communicating out strategies to our suppliers and customers.” The result of all this work speaks for itself and HP has been able to release billions of dollars previously tied up in working capital.</p>
<p>SAP is another company that has worked hard over recent years to improve its working capital efficiency. SAP has transformed the company’s culture and made cash a part of every conversation. “P&amp;L is important, but cash generation is the clearest measure of success for an enterprise in our opinion,” says Todd McElhatton, CFO at SAP North America.</p>
<p>To make sure everyone understands this, SAP has changed how it measures the performance of its staff, giving them KPIs based around first-class working capital management principles. To provide an example, McElhatton explains how the company has turned its sales team into an effective cash collection tool.</p>
<p>“Our sales reps receive their commissions payment for a sale once we have received payment from the customer,” says McElhatton. “Through linking cash collection and commission in this way, our sales reps are now engaged with finance to understand who has and hasn’t paid and chasing up any late payments.”</p>
<p>The use of technology has also empowered SAP to collect more effectively from its customers. McElhatton explains that SAP has recently installed various machine learning and AI powered tools that drive efficiency in its collections process by enabling straight through processes and reducing errors.</p>
<p>These benefits are par for the course of any technology project, says McElhatton. For him, what is most important is the wealth of data on SAP’s customers that this technology produces. “Today, we have a real-time snapshot of our customer’s historical payment performance and every open transaction,” says McElhatton. “This data is invaluable because it means our sales reps can see if their customers have outstanding invoices and find out why these haven’t been paid and ensure we receive payment.”</p>
<h3 id="transformational-technology">Transformational technology</h3>
<p>The power of data to drive working capital improvement is immense according to Cedric Bru, CEO at Taulia. “The reason for this is simple: data gives you the facts,” he says. “Working capital projects fail because companies don’t have the facts to work with.”</p>
<p>To elaborate on this point, Bru says that while all companies know that they can improve their working capital performance, knowing where and how is the challenge. Technology – and the data this creates – allows companies to better measure their working capital performance and gives them a set of facts to work from. “Once companies have a real-time view on their own working capital performance they can compare this to their peers to see if they are leading or lagging,” says Bru. “Companies can then use this data to work out where they need to improve and how to do this.”</p>
<p>Technology can even tell corporates where and how to improve. On the AP side, for example, Taulia has developed a solution that leverages AI and machine learning to analyse its clients’ data and compare this with other corporates. By doing so Taulia can highlight opportunities for them to offer SCF or amend payment terms with their suppliers, for instance. “This is extremely powerful and means that our clients can easily drive meaningful change that benefits the company,” says Bru.</p>
<p>Most importantly though, the use of technology such as this means that corporates can drive continuous improvement, Bru explains. “Working capital is not a static space and the opportunities that corporates have to improve constantly change. Technology such as machine learning and AI don’t sleep and can show the opportunities that exist to our clients in real time every day of the year.”</p>
<p>On the AR side, Lewis Sun, Managing Director, Head of Product Management Asia Pacific at HSBC is also seeing opportunities for corporates to be more dynamic by using innovative technologies. “By using big data and algorithms, corporates can transform their credit policies from static documents to ‘dynamic’ documents,” he says. “In practice this means that the sales team will be able to offer bespoke deals to their customers like improved payment terms or discounts without increasing the risk or damaging working capital performance.”</p>
<p>In the broader scheme of things, Sun believes the increased use of this technology will ultimately give treasury teams the chance to further highlight their value to the organisation. “The board are interested in the bottom line, and if treasury can provide the tools and support that enable the company to improve the bottom line, this will not go unnoticed.”</p>
<h3 id="more-to-come">More to come…</h3>
<p>Working capital is clearly a hot topic and with investment from banks and fintechs pouring into technology to help corporates achieve their working capital objectives there is a lot more to come. And in the view of Victor Penna, Managing Director, Regional Head of Cash Management and Global Head of Treasury Solutions at Standard Chartered, the possibilities are limitless.</p>
<p>“As the world becomes more connected through the rise of eCommerce and the use of internet of things (IoT), corporates are being presented with the chance to completely revisit how they buy and sell and how they interact with suppliers and customers,” say Penna. “As a result, this will completely redefine the working capital metrics.”</p>
<p>Penna provides the example of parts supplied by a manufacturing company. “Traditionally, the company would need to keep a supply of parts so that they could be replaced in equipment when needed – this obviously adds to the DIO of the company,” he says. “However, when you use the IoT and use sensors on the equipment that records their wear, an automated purchase order can then be created when the part need replacing so that parts can be manufactured as they are needed and they arrive at the customer just in time – significantly reducing the days inventory outstanding (DIO).”</p>
<p>This is just a single example, but when you apply this to every other facet of corporate life Penna believes it changes the game completely, linking the physical and financial supply chains more closely than ever before. “In my view, working capital is the new frontier for corporate treasury,” he says. “These developments will give treasurers a multitude of opportunities to have a positive impact on the business, above and beyond the areas they are focusing on today.”</p>
<h3 id="ahead-of-the-game">Ahead of the game</h3>
<p>Although much of this technology is in a nascent stage, initiatives such as those carried out by HP and SAP demonstrate the working capital benefits that can be achieved today. If that was not enough, Taulia’s Bru offers something else to consider, commenting on the rising interest rate environment in the US (and potentially elsewhere as economic improvement continues).</p>
<p>“Treasurers have been working in a low-interest rate environment for a decade now where it has been cheap to borrow,” he says. “This has made it relatively easy to fund the business cost-effectively using debt. As rates rise, however, the dynamics change: debt becomes expensive and working capital becomes the cheapest form of funding. As a result, those treasury teams that are focusing on working capital today will be in the best position to ensure they can cost-effectively fund the digital transformations of their business.”</p>

<h3 id="lay-of-the-land">Lay of the land</h3>
<p>The Hackett Group’s annual survey of working capital performance of the world’s leading corporates provide interesting insight into the current state of play. Here is how corporates in the US, Asia and Europe are currently performing.</p>
<h4 id="us">US</h4>
<p>The working capital performance of the top 1,000 US corporates improved slightly in 2016, with the average cash conversion cycle (CCC) falling from 37.1 days in 2015 to 35.7 days in 2016.</p>
<p>Much of the improvement came in DPO as corporates pushed out payment terms and implemented SCF programmes. Conversely, both DIO and days sales outstanding (DSO) deteriorated in 2016.</p>
<h4 id="asia">Asia</h4>
<p>Working capital performance in Asia is on a downward trajectory and the region’s 1,000 largest listed companies had around US$2trn tied up in working capital in 2015 – the latest data available. The average CCC is 45.6 days, the worst seen in the region for more than ten years.</p>
<p>The opportunities to improve working capital performance are abundant. Hackett suggests that better working capital management will unlock US$741bn in inventories, US$633bn in receivables and US$579bn in payables for these companies.</p>
<h4 id="europe">Europe</h4>
<p>In 2016, the CCC of Europe’s 1,000 largest companies slipped due to an increase in inventory and receivables. As a result, these companies lost the use of over €1trn, which remained tied up in net working capital.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>The world of treasury sits astride multiple corporate functions and is perfectly placed to see trends unfold. We look at some of the key developments of the day.</em></p>
<p>Oscar Wilde said of fashion that it is a “form of ugliness so intolerable that we have to alter it every six months”. Whilst treasurers may not suffer quite the same flightiness foisted upon the denizens of the catwalk, the speculators and manipulators of industry thinking sometimes act like fashion gurus, pushing certain notions far beyond their current actual value in their desire to keep ahead of the trends.</p>
<p>Mobile treasury is a classic example of a lot of hot air from the providers being met by a lukewarm response from the receivers. Treasurers do use the technology, but many – most even – are not conducting their day-to-day business on a smartphone. Supply chain finance (SCF) too receives the kind of coverage that would suggest it is used by most corporates. It isn’t. Respected industry pundit, Enrico Camerinelli of the Aite Group has said that whilst there is no question that the principles of SCF are strong and that the correspondent benefits are considerable, “the reality shows that SCF programmes are evolving very slowly and are far from widespread adoption”.</p>
<p>It’s very easy to get carried away with the hype or to become so involved with a process that it starts to feel like a fully-fledged mainstream movement in its own right. The truth about any treasury trend is that it will be an observable operational or strategic condition that affects some of the people all of the time, or all of the people some of the time but rarely all of the people all of the time.</p>
<p>Of course, unforeseen events of magnitude – such as political uprisings, natural disasters and even financial events such as the 2007/2008 financial crisis, the euro cap by the Swiss National Bank and the fallout following ‘Brexit’ – will always make an impact on treasury operations and they have to be tackled promptly. But the profession should always be mindful of the direction of the industry and the major themes that are carrying it that way.</p>
<p>Not all trends come to full fruition but awareness of what’s out there offers valuable insight for every treasurer, whether they have a domestic or global outlook.</p>
<p>With this very much in mind the following pointers – drawn from Treasury Today’s conversations with industry stakeholders over the last few months, should be a useful ‘awareness’ resource. Some of these are not so obvious but all have gained a lot of ground in recent times as issues that matter.</p>
<h3 id="currency-volatility-not-going-away">Currency volatility: not going away</h3>
<p>It is impossible to provide a detailed forecast for the monetary situation in each individual country; what happens in one area tends to influence developments elsewhere. In the US, the Fed’s tightening bias has serious consequences for the emerging markets. In turn, this will have repercussions for the US economy, which is sensitive to share price movement. Sharp stock market pullbacks will hit the economy hard. Monetary policy divergence between different countries leads to currency fluctuations. This does not matter greatly in good economic times but now that growth is subdued, currency weakness may be a bonus in many places whereas a strong currency can do a lot of damage. The effects of Brexit saw at least in some quarters a welcome scaling back of sterling against the US dollar. The markets, keen to dump GBP, saw yen as a good home, for example. But the attention was most unwelcome by a Japan keen to keep its currency relatively weak.</p>
<p>All central banks will have to tread cautiously when tightening or loosening policy. For currency and interest rates markets, this all means 2016 going into 2017 will see more volatility than seen in say the last quarters of 2015.</p>
<p>Given the ongoing state of global economics, currency volatility is perhaps less a trend than the norm. For treasurers, with every FX hedging strategy (hopefully) being continuously reviewed for effectiveness, Switzerland-based treasury consultant and interim treasurer, Thomas Stahr, says one of the most important concurrent themes for many firms is the implementation of IFRS 9.</p>
<p>The IASB’s new reporting structure includes requirements for recognition and measurement, impairment, de-recognition and general hedge accounting. As such, it offers improvements over the IAS 39 rules it will replace, but also removes aspects such as the 80-125% effectiveness testing bandwidth. Although not due to fully replace IAS 39 until 2018, early adoption is permissible. However, says Stahr, “the tricky thing is that there is almost no experience in the implementation of IFRS 9 in the market and there is no audit firm at the moment who can say with a very high degree of certainty what is right and what is wrong”. Keeping ahead of the curve in difficult times is no easy matter.</p>
<h3 id="technology-virtual-accounts-easing-the-flow">Technology: virtual accounts easing the flow</h3>
<p>Technology trends are prone to being carried on waves of hype. What treasurers need are solutions with substance, that can be used in the real world to their advantage. For many stakeholders, the hot topic around innovation in cash management is the ‘virtual account’. The idea has seen widespread adoption by insurance companies, FX brokerages and pension funds for a number of years but banks have been taking up the cause in recent times, offering it as a practical, sensible tool for corporate clients. In short, this is a trend that is delivering.</p>
<p>Virtual accounts are based on bank-issued virtual bank account numbers that re-route payments to the underlying physical bank account they are linked to, ensuring each remitter is uniquely identified. From a remitter perspective, virtual accounts look and function exactly like a real bank account number, and do not require any changes other than ensuring they pay into the new unique account number provided to them.</p>
<p>With companies seeking to use one central location for accounts in a single currency, one of the challenges is reconciliation and understanding precisely who is being paid for what. In a typical virtual account scenario, as the virtual account detail (VA Name and VA Account Identifier) is passed on to the beneficiary, when the beneficiary receives the payment it can see it has come from the ‘virtual’ account of the subsidiary. Equally, should a payment be rejected, the company paying on behalf of the subsidiary can see straight away which virtual account the payment has come from and return it to the right subsidiary for correction.</p>
<p>The virtual account concept is being adopted in many countries around the world but true global provision is not yet possible. However, progress is being made. In Asia, BNP Paribas’ solution is already live in more than ten countries. The bank told Treasury Today last year that it will not be stopping there; the Middle East and the Americas, for example, already in its sights.</p>
<p>For Marek Chruściel, Treasury Director of Polish telco, Play, virtual account technology has without doubt made cash management a great deal more efficient. The company now runs five billing cycles each month and payments are received 365 days a year – running to over 350,000 on peak days. Payment data files are delivered on a daily basis by the bank via secure file transfer protocol (SFTP) or web service every afternoon and they are processed overnight with payments assigned in Play’s billing system.</p>
<p>Payments are automatically allocated, with very occasional manual input for any individual payment that requires it. “The biggest benefit is the true automation of incoming payments,” says Chruściel. “But it can also help to improve customer satisfaction because you can avoid unnecessary interaction with the clients regarding any payments that you think you didn’t receive but did in fact receive. Virtual accounts give us all the information we need the same day as the customer makes the payment.”</p>
<p>The biggest challenge in implementing a virtual account system is actually working out technical details, he warns. This includes the structure of the virtual accounts, the composition of the data, and ironing out the service level agreement. “These processes need to be carefully thought through, to ensure maximum automation. Otherwise you might end up with a lot of transactions that still require manual entry and intervention.”</p>
<h3 id="diversity-advancing-equality">Diversity: advancing equality</h3>
<p>The treasury profession remains largely male-dominated. If this is to be redressed, women need to be much more visible in their roles, both inside and outside of their organisation. Like currency volatility, this is not so much a trend as an ongoing issue for the profession but at least the movement towards equality is exhibiting an increasingly positive outlook.</p>
<p>As part of the move to address gender diversity in the financial industry, Treasury Today’s Women in Treasury initiative creates a platform to enable women to communicate with one another, to learn from each other and to network in order to help each other.</p>
<p>The Women in Treasury Asia Forum, held this year in Singapore, is a testament to the willingness of participants to be forthright in their discussion. A panel of prominent treasurers from the region agreed that whilst progress has been made regarding gender diversity, women can still do more to advance their careers.</p>
<p>If this can be achieved, it was widely agreed that business would be better placed to succeed. As Jaime Lee, Regional Head, Treasury and Risk Management at Courts explains: “The best teams are always the ones where both men and women work together to achieve something that would otherwise be elusive for an all-male team or an all-female team.”</p>
<p>For Deepali Pendse, Head of Corporate Treasury Sales, Southeast Asia, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, it has already been proven that gender equality is more than just an added bonus; it actually provides businesses with a different perspective and a competitive advantage. However, she feels that although quotas are often mooted as a way to build a more equal workplace, they remain a somewhat contentious issue. Structural changes within companies are what’s needed to provide a more prudent method of driving sustainable long-term gender equality in the workplace.</p>
<p>A large part of this structural shift will come from removing unconscious bias, which Pendse believes we are all guilty of holding in one form or another. “Unconscious bias can come into play when we are hiring, promoting, or in our day-to-day interactions with other people, so it is important to be aware of these and try to find solutions that are better for the firm.” Her advice is to question and evaluate the decisions being made in light of the bias that exists. In doing so, it will help managers to understand their staff better and help them flourish in the workplace.</p>
<p>Whilst business, and society in general, needs to make more changes, Pendse argues that women have a crucial role to play in building an equal and inclusive workplace. “These changes won’t happen by themselves. I encourage women to engage their managers should they feel an unconscious bias exists, or if support is lacking.”</p>
<h3 id="market-liberalisation-china-and-india-paving-the-way">Market liberalisation: China and India paving the way</h3>
<h4 id="china-moving-up-a-gear">China: moving up a gear</h4>
<p>In a global market place, the strongest survive. For a country to be able to move successfully into overseas trade, the economic, social and political conditions need to allow businesses to transact in both directions as smoothly as possible. In most western markets, the rules are such that trade flow is relatively unhindered (the ramifications of Brexit aside). In emerging trade nations, where markets have demonstrated far tighter control over financial activities there is a notable trend towards liberalisation, not for internal consumption but as part of a new global outlook. In India and China, the giants of Asia, the two countries are at different stages of this journey.</p>
<p>“In China, the journey of RMB has been long and arduous, taking in three broad stages of development,” says Amol Gupte, Head of ASEAN and Citi Country Officer for Singapore. Its arrival as a trade currency has been largely successful (a quarter of all Chinese imports are already denominated in RMB). But its capital convertibility is still at an initial stage and the third phase of becoming a reserve currency is best described as ‘just off the starting blocks’ – joining the IMF’s list of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) was scheduled for October 2016 and this is only the beginning. Becoming a meaningful reserve currency is some way off.</p>
<p>For RMB to gain traction, it must attain the ability to be freely-denominated, it must be easy to transfer in and out of China, and there must be capacity to co-mingle the two expressions of RMB (CNY in China and CNH in Hong Kong). ‘Ease of use’ also means establishing a regulatory environment conducive to commerce and creating a general setting which market participants are comfortable with.</p>
<p>Many commentators also argue that there is a need for China to open up its capital account, creating and developing its offshore financial markets so investors can hold RMB-denominated assets overseas. China’s clearing infrastructure must facilitate easier movement and settlement of RMB across the world too. This is where the multi-bank China International Payment System (CIPS) project has a key role to play, enabling banks to offer their worldwide client-base settlement in RMB. The importance of ensuring deep liquidity in RMB both onshore and offshore must also be attended to. Only a handful of countries (including Hong Kong and Singapore) have so far used the currency swap lines that the Chinese government has opened up to enable market players to indirectly benefit from that liquidity.</p>
<p>Intrinsically linked to the development of China as an economic force is its way of approaching governance, land reforms, income inequality, healthcare, pensions, education, the environment and a host of other internal matters. These will all at some point intersect with and influence the financial flows of the country.</p>
<p>For corporate treasurers with a meaningful portion of their balance sheet in RMB, it will require an understanding of the influence of reform on their supply chain, in terms of their clients and suppliers. At the very least treasurers must understand how to link onshore domestic flows into offshore flows. But if progress was ever doubted, consider that just a couple of years ago money in China was effectively trapped cash. Today, the regulations allow RMB to be moved in and out under certain defined processes. It’s a trend that just keeps going.</p>
<h4 id="india-picking-up-the-pace">India: picking up the pace</h4>
<p>In 2016, the IMF predict that India will grow faster than any other major emerging economy at 7.5%, eclipsing the 6.3% predicted of China in the same year. This has taken some effort by the incumbent political and banking leaders. Indeed, in the two years since India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi took office, he has taken a number of small but significant steps towards modernisation, liberalisation and opening up the economy to more foreign direct investment (FDI), making India a more business-friendly location. According to a Financial Times study, between January and June 2015, the country attracted $31bn of FDI, surpassing China ($28bn) and the US ($27bn).</p>
<p>The red tape has to an extent been loosened and many permits required to do business can now be obtained online. There has been increased spending on India’s infrastructure. Corporate tax is due to be cut an unprecedented 25% during Modi’s tenure and FDI reforms now allow up to 100% FDI in areas such as aviation and defence.</p>
<p>With an historical over-reliance on the banking sector for funding, corporate treasurers in India are certainly keeping a close eye on what is happening. “Discussions around development of a proper bond market have been around for quite some time and regulators are trying hard to push through, but the turn of economic cycle and loss of confidence is complicating matters further and shying investors away,” says Harish Barai, Senior Deputy Manager, Corporate Finance – Treasury at Larsen &amp; Toubro.</p>
<p>In an attempt to diversify their funding needs some Indian corporates, in particular the highly rated names, have looked overseas to raise funds due to cost. However, companies can now raise funds overseas using the rupee. The so-called Masala Bonds look set to help internationalise the rupee and also deepen the financial system. The current Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) norms allow an Indian entity to raise a maximum of $750m per year through Masala bonds with a minimum maturity of five years. For corporates, the ability to issue such a bond will not only shield the Indian entity against the risk of currency fluctuation, but also allow for a more diversified range of funding sources and perhaps even lower costs moving forward.</p>
<p>Developments in the payments infrastructure have enabled corporates to develop centralised models facilitated by the use of sweeping and pooling arrangements. Indian multinational engineering firm, Larsen &amp; Toubro, for instance has adopted this model. “Our cash flows back to the head office banks and we utilise technology to ensure that we have high visibility in order to avoid running idle balances,” says Barai.</p>
<p>He favours the progressive approach, commenting that the regulators are removing lots of the restrictions for both foreign and domestic companies. “Before the Modi government came in, forms were being submitted to government agencies and they just sat there not being processed. Now we see these move through at much greater speed and it is my belief that in the next year or so India will substantially move up the ease of doing business rankings.”</p>
<h3 id="soft-skills-for-the-benefit-of-all">Soft skills: for the benefit of all</h3>
<p>Without the right people and the right approach, a business will always struggle to excel at anything. It is an increasingly powerful notion that managing people to get the best from them is a most expedient model. The required skill – often referred to as a ‘soft skill’ – is not something everyone is born with. “The problem is that nobody teaches you how to identify what you need in human resources, how to manage staff that aren’t performing – and how to manage those that are – and how to build good relationships with the banks,” says Gary Slawther, Financing Advisor to the CEO at Octal in Oman. It is, he determines, “something that only comes with experience”.</p>
<p>Soft skills include the ability to build relationships and to manage people and expectations. In a sales role this is vital, but it is increasingly a management requirement to get the buy-in of all stakeholders when planning change, for example, and on a day-to-day level, handling the peculiarities of people. Companies which overlook the value of soft skills do so at great cost, says Slawther.</p>
<p>But it is not just an individual manager’s responsibility to create the right environment. Vivian Peng, Asia Treasurer and VP of Treasury, Flex Group says company culture allows the team to innovate in a complex environment. That same culture fosters “a great team spirit”, informing Peng’s belief that “their hard work, their ability to work as a team and also their willingness to learn” is the very key to success.</p>


<blockquote>The best teams are always the ones where both men and women work together to achieve something that would otherwise be elusive for an all-male team or an all-female team.</blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source">Jaime Lee, Regional Head, Treasury and Risk Management, Courts</p>


<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Christine McCarthy, Senior EVP and CFO, The Walt Disney Company says that when it comes to working with her staff, she steers clear of micro-management. “I learnt a long time ago from one of my mentors in banking that when you find someone who has potential, you give them enough rope to hang themselves but hopefully they won’t.”</p>
<p>As part of her remit to develop talent, McCarthy believes it is essential to keep high-potential people motivated. To do that you have got to give them the ability to make decisions and earn acknowledgement for the work they do. “I want them to be out in front getting the recognition they deserve; the downside risk is that they must perform and succeed. It can be a high-risk strategy on my part so I can’t give everyone the same amount of rope; I have to discern who is ready for those challenges.” However, she will never just “put them out to pasture; I keep my eye on them. The more they can do and the more they can achieve, the more they will grow as professionals.”</p>
<p>When it comes to developing skills and knowledge, it is important to keep in touch with the wider treasury peer group too says Ingmar Bergmann, Corporate Treasurer and Head of Corporate Finance for Dutch real-estate firm, NSI. He is a firm believer that the international community of treasurers can help each other to do a better job. “If you want to take treasury to a higher level then you definitely have to communicate and open up to others, even beyond the company.”</p>
<p>The most effective teams combine significant diversity – of personality, background, outlook and skills – but with a shared set of values. This is important, notes Mark Loftus, a Chartered Clinical Psychologist, an Associate Fellow of the British Psychological Society and Managing Director of ‘The Thinking Partnership’. Just as shared values without diversity leads to stultifying group-think, so diversity without common values will lead to fragmentation.</p>
<p>Firmly believing that “teams become teams by working together on a common purpose”, Loftus comments that it is nonetheless rare for corporates to focus on helping people learn the skills of being in a team. Help is out there but, at his own admission, he says the team-building industry has not always covered itself in glory, prone as it is to “psycho-babble and mumbo jumbo”. Don’t dismiss it all though, he advises. “People are right to be sceptical but at the same time, do look for the small percentage that is useful.”</p>
<p>Dr Travis Bradberry, President at training and coaching services provider, TalentSmart, has a common sense approach. “If managers want their best people to stay, they need to think carefully about how they treat them,” he notes. The talent of good employees, he notes “gives them an abundance of options”. As such, managers “need to make people want to work for them”. In today’s uncertain times, this is a trend that should be encouraged for the sake of all parties.</p>
<h3 id="blockchain-from-abstract-totreasury-reality">Blockchain: from abstract to treasury reality</h3>
<p>Because the distributed ledger or ‘blockchain’ concept gets so much coverage it would be churlish not to give it a mention in a piece on trends. Most people want to hear how it can be used in the real world. Here are a few trending possibilities (and remember it is early days).</p>
<h4 id="supply-chain-efficiencies">Supply chain efficiencies</h4>
<p>As head of Port of Rotterdam’s Strategic Finance &amp; Treasury team, Tim de Knegt sees ‘industry’ close at hand (it is after all one of the world’s business ports). For him an opportunity is being missed to align the logistical, physical and financial supply chains. In respect of finance, he argues that if stakeholders adopt a more “holistic” approach, the advantages could be significant. “Right now, it is very much point-to-point financing but the holistic approach could dramatically cut costs across the full supply chain.”</p>
<p>In a manufacturing process that could involve 20 or more suppliers, traditional supply chain finance is wasteful, he believes. “If the whole process could be financed at one point only – so the end customer finances the producers – then multiple individual financing stages are removed.” Doing so could save in excess of 10% of the total goods’ value. This could be applied to just about any manufacturing process that involves movement of multiple constituents from different suppliers towards a finished product.</p>
<p>However, the biggest challenge in the transition to a holistic model has always been data sharing. Blockchain can allow each data provider to retain full control, indelibly recording the progress of the physical supply chain, the accompanying shipping documentation and the parts of the financial supply chain that confirm receipt and release payments along the way.</p>
<h4 id="commodities-tracking">Commodities tracking</h4>
<p>Tracking assets from production through to delivery is where Nick Weisfeld, Head of Data Practice at software and consultancy firm, GFT, sees real blockchain value being added. Whether that asset is financial (such as a bond) or physical (such as a commodity), he argues that “understanding where treasury’s assets are located and who owns them will allow the department to operate in a more streamlined way”.</p>
<p>GFT has produced a prototype which allows tracking of multiple physical commodities. With a number of high profile cases of fraud within the commodities market – typically the result of a failure to tightly control physical inventories – Julian Eyre, Commodities Product Owner at GFT says this prototype is intended to showcase blockchain’s ability to create a full audit trail for each and every participant in the movement of physical commodities.</p>
<p>It will be of particular interest where proof of ownership and location of the physical commodity are essential for market participants. Warehouse receipt financing, for example, where there may be a number of duplicate and therefore confusing receipts created for a bank’s financing of a commodities deal, may well be de-risked by this type of technology. This could be done by digitally capturing, locking down and tracking an underlying physical asset by features such as origination, current location, beneficial owner, certain attributes of its quality or grading, and its provenance.</p>
<p>Tracking is enabled by capturing data held by a unique identifier for each commodity ‘parcel’ (a consignment of iron ore or wheat, for example) through each stage of its lifecycle. “It would be possible to transfer the parcel ID through the value chain, literally to the ingredients on the packaging of the finished goods,” explains Eyre.</p>
<p>A commercial settlement function is not yet included in the GFT prototype but parallel offerings from the likes of Bolero, the DBS/Standard Chartered partnership and others that follow may well solve this part of the commodities trade lifecycle too. Combining it with de Knegt’s holistic supplier finance model would make for a compelling solution. Indeed, blockchain is trending now because there are some real-world applications for it that look like offering as yet unimagined benefits to corporates and corporate treasurers.</p>
<h4 id="and-bitcoin">And bitcoin?</h4>
<p>Bitcoin should be mentioned here as the first very public incarnation of blockchain technology, but at what stage of its development is it at today? It is supposed to be a virtual currency, without borders, but this looks like it may be changing, according to Australia’s Sydney Morning Herald business section. The paper reported that four Chinese companies, which have invested heavily in bitcoins and the computer technology needed to create (‘mine’) the currency, now account for more than 70% of the transactions on the bitcoin network. China, it said, has become a market for bitcoin “unlike anything in the West, fuelling huge investments in server farms [or ‘mining pools’] as well as enormous speculative trading on Chinese bitcoin exchanges”. New York Times analysis further indicated that by mid-2016 these exchanges accounted for 42% of all bitcoin transactions.</p>
<p>The Sydney Morning Herald quoted Bobby Lee, Chief Executive of Shanghai-based bitcoin company BTCC, as saying one of the reasons the Chinese took to bitcoin in such a big way is that the Chinese government “had strictly limited other potential investment avenues, giving citizens a hunger for new assets”. When speculative bitcoin activity in China in late 2013 went stratospheric, it pushed the price of a single bitcoin above $1000. A concerned Chinese government intervened, cutting off the flow of money between Chinese banks and bitcoin exchanges. This led to the massive interest in bitcoin mining and technology investments seen in the country today. The vast server farms used to mine the currency are powered by cheap energy sources found in the country (and less likely to be found anywhere else). The bitcoin mining machines in Lee’s facilities alone use about 38 megawatts of electricity, enough apparently to power a small city. The Australian paper concluded that the bitcoin concept may now be less decentralised than first hoped. As a currency for global trade, the power it seems may yet lie with China, just not as expected.</p>
<p>As an interesting addendum to the bitcoin story, a survey in June 2016 by corporate networking company Citrix, shows that out of 250 IT and security workers in UK companies with 250 or more employees, a third said they were stockpiling the currency so they can pay cybercriminals in the event ransomware – illicitly deployed to lockdown systems – strikes their network. Some 35% of large firms (those with over 2,000 employees) said they were willing to pay over £50,000 to regain access to important intellectual property (IP) or business critical data.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>Supplier finance is often seen as a solution too good to be true. And whilst corporates operating in Europe and the US may now have seen the benefits it can bring, many here in Asia are only just beginning to realise its potential. So what makes a successful supplier financing programme? Treasury Today Asia speaks to a number of experts to find out.</em></p>
<p>Experienced business practitioners will tell you that there is no such thing as a ‘free lunch’. So when a solution is being billed as ‘win-win’ it can, perhaps correctly, cause distrust and doubt. And supplier finance – sometimes called supply chain finance (SCF), reverse factoring or confirming, depending on who you speak to – is one such product that carries the ‘win-win’ label.</p>
<p>Supplier finance is a form of receivables-driven financing that is initiated by the buyer, through their relationship bank(s). The traditional model works by allowing the supplier to leverage the buyer’s credit rating and access an agreed percentage of the due payment up front from the bank. The ‘win-win’ comes from the fact that in return, the buyer is able to push out payment terms or benefit from early payment discounts, safe in the knowledge that their suppliers are being supported financially.</p>
<p>Although in Asia Pacific (APAC) there remains a debate on whether the solution is a ‘win-win’ for corporates and their suppliers, it certainly has begun to take hold elsewhere. Indeed, research undertaken by BCR Publishing and published in their 2016 World Supply Chain Finance Report, estimated that at the end of 2014 the market was worth €46bn (roughly $52bn) globally. And there is plenty of room for this market to grow, driven in large part by corporates in Asia.</p>
<h3 id="the-first-step-to-success">The first step to success</h3>
<p>Having said that, corporates that have worked on supplier finance projects in Europe and the US will confirm that these programmes are often difficult to get off the ground. This is not because of any failure of the product itself. The initial challenge instead comes from the need to drive alignment across numerous business functions and achieve buy-in to the project.</p>
<p>“As companies grow in size, individual departments often develop independently of one another,” notes Roque Damacela, Head, Open Account Trade &amp; Commodities Financing at Standard Chartered. “In doing so, they often establish their own key performance indicators (KPIs). As supplier finance programmes often depend on multiple functions, they have the potential to disrupt individual departments and as a result, the benefits of adopting such a programme are not always immediately clear to each function.” For example, the procurement department may be incentivised to strengthen only certain more critical suppliers, while treasury may wish to leverage a programme to fully optimise working capital benefits across the supplier base.</p>
<p>Whichever department is championing the solution – this is likely to be either treasury or procurement – therefore needs to ensure that it outlines a clear set of objectives that not only demonstrate how it can deliver value to the business holistically, but also how it can enable each individual function to better deliver on their own objectives. “If this isn’t completed correctly and internal alignment isn’t achieved, there is a danger that the project will fall at the first hurdle,” adds Damacela.</p>
<p>The formation of a cross-functional working group can be another method used to ensure that the company is aligned with the project. This will be led by either treasury and/or procurement, but also feature colleagues from other functions that will be materially impacted, including accounting, IT and legal.</p>
<p>For Brian Medley, Director of Sales at Prime Revenue, the formation of such a group is vital given the broader implications a supplier finance programme can have on the business. “A supplier finance programme is not just another project run by treasury or procurement. It is a fundamental transformation of how the company does business with its suppliers. It shouldn’t be completed in a silo and should be built into the broader, long-term strategy for the company.”</p>
<p>To that end, it can also be very useful to have a mandate from senior management. After all, CFO and CEO buy-in will always ensure that other departments take notice of the project.</p>
<h3 id="important-decisions">Important decisions</h3>
<p>Once internal alignment and buy-in is achieved, the next step is to find a solution, and a partner, that will be able to deliver on the company’s requirements and give the programme the best chance of success. For the most part, corporates have two options: a bank-led solution, or the offerings of a technology provider – some large corporates have also developed their own in-house solution, although this isn’t typical. Both options have their own unique selling points.</p>
<h4 id="bank-led">Bank-led</h4>
<p>Here in APAC there are a number of banks that are offering supplier finance solutions. These are typically the US and European names, as well as a handful of regional players. In the view of Bruno Lechevalier, Head of Supply Chain Management Asia at BNP Paribas, a bank led solution, particularly that of an established name, has an advantage because “it has been tried and tested over many years in numerous markets”. This results in those banks having “best-in-class platforms and a standardised offering in terms of documentation that enables corporates to quickly and relatively easily set-up a programme”.</p>
<p>It must be noted however, that whilst the expertise of a bank and its well-developed platform can be an attractive proposition, bank-led supplier finance programmes are not homogenous. They can vary greatly depending on the footprint of the bank and its appetite to do business in certain countries. Understanding a bank’s network and future plans is therefore crucial when selecting a solution.</p>


<blockquote>The choice of bank is often more important than first considered when carrying out a supplier finance project.</blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source">Paul Melkebeke, Vice President, Supply, Asia, Samsonite</p>


<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>For Paul Melkebeke, Vice President, Supply, Asia at Samsonite, a company that opted for a bank-led solution, this point is especially pertinent. “The choice of bank is often more important than first considered when carrying out a supplier finance project,” he says. “All banks are able to talk-up their solution, but it is important to carefully evaluate their capabilities in the markets that you operate in and across the currencies that you use to make sure these align with your objectives. We operate a US dollar and RMB programme, for instance, and not all banks can offer a RMB programme.”</p>
<p>Samsonite’s banking partner did not only have to offer a suitable solution, however. It also had to have a significant presence in the markets that the company’s suppliers operate in. “We wanted to make sure that our suppliers had somebody local that they could speak to and who could visit them personally to discuss the solution. In my view, this was critical to ensuring the suppliers bought in to the project and its overall success.”</p>
<h4 id="bank-agnostic">Bank agnostic</h4>
<p>There are corporates however, that may not wish to align its suppler finance programme to a single bank. These companies are likely to be more interested in bank agnostic supplier finance solutions offered by third-party technology providers, such as Prime Revenue, Demica and Taulia, to name but a few.</p>
<p>In brief, these companies offer portals which sit in between the corporate, its suppliers and numerous sources of funding. The main advantage of these solutions, of course, is that it enables corporates to utilise numerous parties to fund their suppliers. This doesn’t have to be limited to banks, a corporate may use their own cash, or even tap into alternative funds such as hedge, mutual and even pension funds, all of whom are increasing their interest in trade receivables.</p>
<p>“The multi-funder strategy matches the pressures of today’s business environment as the needs of corporates, suppliers and funding providers shifts,” says Prime Revenue’s Medley. “By choosing a bank agnostic offering, corporates will not only be able to build a supplier finance programme in all the countries they need to, using the currencies they require, they will also be able to use their funding sources strategically.”</p>
<p>Building on this point, Medley notes that: “Supplier finance is not about one point in time. It is about developing a long-term viable solution that is scalable as the business ebbs and flows. Using a multi-funder solution therefore allows your supplier finance programme to adapt as the business, regulatory environments and banking relationships change.”</p>
<h3 id="regulatory-hurdles">Regulatory hurdles</h3>
<p>Whichever solution is selected, corporates and their partner(s) here in Asia will still have to navigate the region’s complex regulatory environment. When this is tied to the myriad of currencies that are used this can create a wealth of complexity, particularly if the solution has a broad reach.</p>
<p>In fact, it is this point that Standard Chartered’s Damacela believes has limited the penetration of regional supplier finance solutions across Asia. “We see many corporates offering supplier finance on a standalone single country basis. This is largely driven by the procurement patterns of corporates and generally reflects situations where the corporate has a local country entity that is doing a fair amount of procurement in country and in local currency. Corporates in these situations sometimes shy away from establishing a fully-fledged regional programme because of the complexity this could bring.”</p>
<p>There are various ways that companies can overcome these challenges. On the currency side, for instance, Samsonite have been able to entice all of its suppliers, aside from those in China, to accept US dollars for payment. As a result, the company has been able to launch a regional programme and also a RMB programme for its Chinese suppliers.</p>
<p>For those that aren’t able to do this there will be a need to launch a number of individual, in-country programmes. But as Standard Chartered’s Damacela, highlights, doing this means that it can be very challenging to “scale a solution similar to how a corporate would in the US and Europe, particularly if the corporate is not able to rely on a single bank partner across the region that understands the country level nuances and also possesses the required capabilities to successfully onboard suppliers”.</p>
<p>Even if the currency problem is overcome, regulation can still prove a big stumbling block. “In Asia, aside from when working in the developed markets such as Singapore and Hong Kong, there may be many blocking points that prohibit the roll out of a regional supplier financing programme,” says BNP Paribas’ Lechevalier. “In some countries, for instance, all transactions must be completed with recourse, creating accounting difficulties for the corporate seller,” he adds.</p>
<h3 id="selling-the-product">Selling the product</h3>
<p>The final, and arguably most crucial, aspect of any supplier finance programme is the ability to sell it to suppliers. It may also be the most challenging.</p>
<p>The aforementioned scepticism around the ‘win-win’ billing the product receives is arguably one key reason that supplier finance programmes are relatively difficult to initiate anywhere in the world. Treasurers and procurement professionals from both Europe and the US will be able to attest to the fact that when the solution is discussed with suppliers there is often some doubt that this will be a good deal for them. And indeed, the same belief exists here in APAC.</p>
<p>Take Samsonite’s experience, for instance. The company, due to both internal and external forces, holds working capital efficiency as a key performance indicator (KPI) and Melkebeke and his team were set the objective of pushing payment terms out to 105 days. There would be no exceptions, apart from with those business critical suppliers. This, of course, was a tough ask for a number of the company’s suppliers and had a detrimental impact on supplier relationships.</p>
<p>Supplier finance seemed to offer a solution. But when having initial conversations with suppliers about the solution Melkebeke found there to be significant resistance. “It seems that there are some negative connotations that exist in the market around supplier finance. Many suppliers seem to believe that there is no upside for them and that it is just a way for larger corporate names to take advantage of them and push out payment terms. It was a big task to convince suppliers that this solution is a win-win,” he explains.</p>
<p>To do this, the company set about educating its suppliers with the aid of its banking partner. “Key to these discussions was transparency,” says Melkebeke. “We never disguised that there was a cost involved for the suppliers – there is a cost for us setting up the programme after all. But we made sure that we communicated that, in the grand scheme of things, there is more upside for the suppliers. This is because by agreeing to join the programme they are able to receive cheaper funding than they could from financing their receivables with a local bank, they can have a more predictable cash flow, they will be able to access their cash faster than before and also by accepting our terms they will become our preferred suppliers and thus potentially receive more business.”</p>
<p>Melkebeke offers a final key word of advice: “It is vital that you take time to pick which suppliers you will trial the solution with. The success of the trial will ultimately make or break the programme. If possible this should be done with well-known companies in the industry to give your programme credibility and the best chance to succeed.”</p>
<h3 id="long-lasting-benefits">Long lasting benefits</h3>
<p>Samsonite has reaped the rewards of this approach, with nearly 95% of suppliers now accepting 105 day payment terms. “Once we went live with the first batch of suppliers, which were high profile names in our industry, the solution quickly gained credibility and traction,” explains Melkebeke. “Where once we had to explain the benefits to suppliers, now they are knocking on our door wanting to be part of the programme.”</p>
<p>As a result, relationships, which at first were tested due to the new payment terms, have actually been strengthened. Internally, there have also been many benefits including procurement now being a net contributor to working capital, for instance, due to the increase in the company’s days payables outstanding (DPO). Cash flow planning has also been greatly improved as a result of the certainty around AP.</p>
<p>“Based on our experience, there is no reason not to launch such a programme, especially if you are paying attention to working capital metrics and do not want to undermine your key supplier relationships,” says Melkebeke. “And now, given the low interest rate environment, is an especially good time to get suppliers on board.”</p>

<p><strong>Adam Smith Awards 2015 Winner – Best Trade Solution</strong></p>
<p>The culmination is a solution comprising three banks, each of which took on an equal role. It really is a uniquely collaborative solution for supply chain financing which you cannot afford to miss.</p>
<p>When representatives of three US banks attended the 2014 Adam Smith Awards ceremony they got more than their lunch! A conversation with last year’s Woman of the Year winner, Anita Prasad of Microsoft planted the seeds for the banks to collaborate on a unique supply chain finance solution. Microsoft insisted they wanted true equality and they would pitch this to their vendors as a financing offer from the three banks invited. After covering a lot of emotional, legal, regulatory, KYC and financial challenges, the three banks agreed. Hear from Anita how she achieved this.</p><p>This webinar was held on Thursday 12th May 2016.<br/></p>

<h2 class="h3 copy__heading">Questions asked throughout the webinar</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your approach to equality among your three major US banks (Citi, Bank of America Merrill Lynch or J.P. Morgan) is a very interesting approach. Would it be fair to say that it was because of who you are and the company being Microsoft that the banks reacted in that way? Surely there must have been one or two disagreements on their part and if so, which aspects of the end solution were impacted the most? Or was it truly a meeting of minds and the three banks really did step up to an equal plate? <strong>(10:39)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How long did it take you to get to that point where the three banks were all on the same page as you? <strong>(13:29)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In terms of the two SAP environments, you didn’t consolidate them you implemented across two separate SAP platforms? <strong>(16:35)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In terms of the overall project and its size, can you give us a feel for the scope and scale of this programme, which the three banks project managed collectively? <strong>(22:04)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many suppliers in total would that relate to? Are we looking at a few hundred or few thousand? <strong>(23:33)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given that pricing was required to be the same across all three banks, what was the goal of having all three banks offer the programme to the suppliers? Was it to allow for the vender to have choices even though the pricing was equal or the same? <strong>(30:22)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the customer wasn’t a client of one of the three banks, was onboarding problematic? <strong>(32:08)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You mentioned that the solution was implemented in a pretty quick time frame across two separate SAP environments, which areas of the SAP implementation were the most difficult and why? Did the three banks help you with the SAP component or was that done internally? <strong>(32:44)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regarding the three banks, was there any particular reason for this number and the actual three banks that you chose? If you were starting this project today, would you do anything differently? <strong>(34:16)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did legal or the Microsoft auditor require Microsoft to keep an arm’s length distance to the financing discussion with the bank? If so, how did Microsoft help ensure the pricing was the same across all three banks? <strong>(36:07)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How did Citi distribute the payment files to the other two banks? <strong>(37:53)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How were you able to reduce the impact of withholding taxes given the global width of the programme? <strong>(38:31)</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>The battle between the banks and the fintech disrupters for a bigger share of the global supply chain finance business is heating up. Both have invested heavily in their platforms over recent years. But who has got the solutions treasurers are really coveting?</em></p>
<p>Not too long ago treasurers interested in supply chain finance (SCF) all tended to follow the same well-trodden route. Sometimes treasurers would look to finance suppliers using payables; sometimes treasurers would look to raise finance themselves using receivables – but almost all the time they would look to one of their banks to deliver the service.</p>
<p>Then new providers came along, the self-proclaimed disrupters of the fintech world. A multitude of these nimble, bank-independent platforms began to spring up around the globe post-financial crisis, each looking to grab their share of a SCF market now said to be worth $275bn and expanding by 30% annually. The new platforms that brought multiple banks together for large programmes introduced new delivery methods to the market – web applications and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) – and they introduced SCF to a whole new type of client. As a result, corporate treasurers today are just as likely to access SCF by clicking a button on their cloud-based TMS or e-invoicing application as they are by picking up a telephone handset and calling a bank.</p>
<p>In this feature, we take a look at the conditions, like recent regulation and technological trends, and especially those that allowed new entrants to crack the SCF market, before explaining why the banks, despite the advantages their new rivals currently enjoy, are not going to give up ground in SCF without a fight.</p>
<h3 id="a-core-bank-product">A core bank product?</h3>
<p>In the battle for the SCF market, the banks sound confident that they will prevail in the long run. Although they are conscious of the challenge posed to traditional business models by fintech, most corporate buyers, they say, still see their institutions as best placed to deliver SCF programmes. “It is a big threat, because these smaller players have the ability to do anything and everything,” Parvaiz Dalal, Citi’s EMEA Supply Chain Finance Head tells Treasury Today. “But it encourages us to keep up the pace, and we are constantly re-engineering our business to ensure we are offering a very efficient processes.”</p>
<p>A large global bank may not be able to match the ‘lightness’ of smaller technology companies, but there are other persuasive arguments, they say, for sticking with them. Top of the list, of course, is the relationship. At a time when banks are looking to increase their share of wallet with key clients and, at the same time, end relationships that are no longer profitable, is it really wise to be giving away a service that could be delivered by a relationship bank to another, less critically important counterparty? “Some treasurers do see it as like buying a system, and will select a software solution,” says Jeremy Shaw, Head of Trade Finance, EMEA at J.P. Morgan. “But most corporates view it more as a core banking product which they allocate to their key relationship banks, because they know they can rely on them and have access to potentially deeper pockets in terms of investment.”</p>
<h3 id="the-long-tail">The long tail</h3>
<p>If there were some clients the tech firms knew they would never prise away from the banks that did not matter, however, because there were many more organisations in the market – the non-top tier corporates the banks ignored – that also needed affordable and accessible solutions.</p>
<p>In 2012, Eric Riddle, EVP &amp; Global Head of SCF at cloud-TMS provider Kyriba, was working for PrimeRevenue, at that time the largest third-party provider of SCF. Back then it was the banks, he explains, that seemed to hold all the cards. “At that time I felt the pressure from large global banks and that relationship capital they held was very significant in terms of their ability to influence decisions and win Reverse Factoring business,” Riddle says. “However, there was never any question that reverse factoring through a bank had limited application beyond a certain point.”</p>
<p>What Riddle means is that banks are encumbered relative to third-party competitors, like Kyriba, because of the various Know-Your-Customer (KYC) requirements such institutions now have to manage through as they onboard suppliers to the programme. Consequently, banks prefer to focus on a small subset of the market, the largest volume suppliers, from which the end justifies the means. These suppliers represent the largest materiality of transaction volume to justify benefit to both the buyer and the supplier as measured against the friction to onboard imposed by KYC. These suppliers are considered to be the low hanging fruit and are referred to as the ‘short tail’ of the SCF market; it is those large stock listed international companies that sit at the summit of the supply chain.</p>
<p>Non-banks have, sensibly, therefore, looked elsewhere for opportunities to intermediate. “Truly, the most dire need for capital, and the most significant opportunity for cash visibility and managing cost and risk in the supply chain is with the long tail,” says Riddle. Leveraging Kyriba’s SaaS-based TMS solution when combined with a non-bank lender, a broader set of companies can now access services such as dynamic discounting, reverse factoring and receivables finance in order to optimise working capital and mitigate risks in the supply chain. It is by virtue of not being a bank that gives Kyriba an advantage in delivering solutions to these types of companies. “In relation to the emergence of Kyriba and other technology providers, we are more willing to embrace innovative solutions and as a result can really have an impact on that long tail. In summary, there is a significant move to technology providers that are not banks and therefore not burdened by KYC.”</p>




<h3 id="onboarding-tips-from-procurement">Onboarding tips from procurement</h3>
<p>Whether it is a bank or a technology provider, picking the right solution is not the end of the job for the corporate treasurer. Indeed, very often, it is what comes next that is the most challenging part of the process.</p>
<p>For SCF to be considered an unmitigated success, the buyer must be able to bring on board all of the trading partners it has designated. But even with all the benefits SCF has to offer suppliers, this is not always as straightforward. As hard experience has taught treasurers time and again, when it comes to SCF, there are suppliers out there who can take some convincing.</p>
<p>What steps can be taken to ensure a better chance of success? Since the procurement department is, in most organisations, the commercial link to the supplier base, there are perhaps few better people to go to for insight on that question.</p>
<p>“I think it comes down to how a project is handled,” says David Loseby, Group Procurement Director, at the multinational transport company Arriva. “Even simple things like first piloting a solution before going ahead with a full-blown roll out are now and again overlooked. A more structured and considered approach will have more phases to it and the finance may not come through as quickly, but what it does give you in the long run is something more sustainable.”</p>
<p>When it comes to the specific issue of handling reticent suppliers, Loseby’s advice is simple: put yourselves in their shoes. It is all about communication. First, the treasurer must not keep in the dark counterparties who will be impacted by a project. Secondly, when treasurers do inform suppliers about an SCF scheme they wish to enrol them on, they must make an effort to communicate to them in a language they understand. Financial jargon, then, should be avoided at all cost. “The rules of all these things are actually very straightforward: keep it simple and keep the communication going keep it transparent and there is a good chance of success,” he says.</p>
<p>Finally, Loseby says, treasurers should, at the very outset, consider whether the solution they are looking for fits with the project’s objectives. Noting that there is a lot more to choose from today in the SCF market, he says that the choice between going through a bank proprietary solution or an independent third party, is made a lot simpler when one knows what one is trying to accomplish. “There have been a lot of developments in the technology space and, as a consequence, that starts to open up new opportunities. If there is an objective to ensure incorporation of SMEs, then that might start to drive a different approach in terms of looking at solutions from niche providers more geared up towards solutions in that market. So that is the overarching imperative for me – understand what is driving the requirement and then work from there.”</p>



<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<h3 id="facilitators">Facilitators</h3>
<p>Escaping that regulatory burden means these companies must be content with being facilitators. Indeed, most do not claim to sell a total solution; they offer platforms, but there are no balance sheet or onboarding capabilities. Another example of such a provider is Basware. The enterprise software company, much like Kyriba in the TMS-world, saw opportunities in the SCF solutions market to build upon its core offering, which happens to be, in this case, Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) solutions. Rather than becoming a regulated financial institution, Basware stands between enterprises looking to borrow and banks looking to lend, utilising the data residing in the network through which millions of companies are using to exchange e-invoices. The middlemen of SCF, if you like.</p>
<p>“Basware does not want to become a bank; we do not want to become a heavily regulated organisation,” explains Ad van der Poel, Senior Vice President, Financial Services, Basware. “So we are not the ones doing the actual financing we are merely facilitating or rather orchestrating between the network, the companies connected to that network and the data we have and the actual funders and financiers. We are actually partnering with the banks. They want to fund SCF, and we want to offer SCF to our clients.”</p>
<p>However, Basware bring something to the table that is invaluable when it comes to delivering SCF solutions to the so-called long tail. Unlike a bank, they already know not only the corporate buyer, but also the supplier, the goods that have been ordered, the amount that has been invoiced, and even when that invoice has been approved. Van der Poel says: “We have the data and we leverage that data by feeding it into risk and pricing assessments allowing us to tell companies, almost immediately, whether they are going to get financing and at what rate.”</p>
<p>All this points to the fact that the market for SCF might not be quite as clear cut as that dichotomous narrative of nimble disrupters versus dinosaur incumbents initially leads us to believe. Even when it is a TMS the customer goes to, it is the banks (together with an array of other institutional and retail investors) that are ultimately the ones providing the capital. Collaboration of this sort between technology providers and banks could be seen as being very beneficial for the corporate end-users of SCF; a means for them, perhaps, to overcome bottlenecks and potential credit inefficiencies found when using single banks.</p>
<h3 id="growth-potential">Growth potential</h3>
<p>For that reason, some banks recognise that there is value to them in participating in deals led by third-party vendors. However, significant investments have not been made by the banks in their own proprietary technologies for no reason. They are seeing growing demand for SCF, and they are convinced that their solutions are best placed to meet that demand. “We continue to see more interest from companies [considering SCF],” says J.P. Morgan’s Shaw. “There are companies who may not have had a programme in place previously in industries which, historically, were very cash rich, such as energy commodities, for instance which are now looking at supply chain finance. And there are also companies that have a programme, but now wish to look to expand it in size or geographically.”</p>


<blockquote>We have the data and we leverage that data by feeding it into risk and pricing assessments allowing us to tell companies, almost immediately, whether they are going to get financing and at what rate.</blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source">Ad van der Poel, Senior Vice President, Financial Services, Basware</p>


<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>For Citi’s Parvaiz, SCF is still a growth engine with opportunities to expand their services now presenting themselves across new regions as well as new market segments. “When you look at companies in developing markets, there is still a big gap between the best performers and the worst performers,” says Citi’s Parvaiz. “The worst performers are not necessarily the small firms, but rather the larger companies that simply have not been able to achieve the efficiency that some of their peers have achieved. Traditionally, retailers used to do a lot of supplier financing but lately we’ve seen a rise in energy segment like oil and gas, power, industrial housing, airlines and shipping. We are seeing new segments that are buying into this solution and deploying it. For that reason, I see a lot of room for growth in this business. There will be no slowing down.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the likes of Kyriba, Taulia and Basware are expected to continue to focus their attention in the area where they are seeing most interest, the long tail. But while there may be many more companies in this bracket – relative to those sectors that the banks are targeting – this does not necessarily mean technology providers have the best growth prospects. As Kyriba’s Riddle readily acknowledges: “The largest relationships are often the most powerful because around 80% of the money spent is with 20% of businesses in the supply chain. The banks do very well in the top of the supply chain – that short tail as they call it.”</p>
<p>The entry of new players into the SCF market, and the new ideas they have brought with them, has certainly given the incumbents of the banking world something to think about. But as the comments of Dalal and Shaw emphasise, SCF remains a growth industry. Are the banks likely to now give up on proprietary solutions that they not only have made considerable investments in, but are also now drawing interest from an ever-broader portfolio of corporate clients? Not a chance.</p>
<p>So, however one looks at it, the battle for the SCF market is looking increasingly finely balanced. However, for all the treasurers out there shopping for new solutions, it seems that the choice will ultimately come down to what they are looking to achieve through SCF and, in particular, the parts of the supply chain they are most concerned about supporting. If there is one overriding value the new competitive landscape brings to corporate treasurers, it is the range of new opportunities it presents for them to optimise both their working capital, and that of their suppliers.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>The last two decades have seen a seismic shift in global trade corridors. Where once trade was conducted primarily between developed western nations; today, emerging markets, and more specifically Asia, are now at the heart of those flows. So with trading relationships extending further afield and encompassing a broader range of companies than ever before, what has the impact been on international treasurers?</em></p>
<p>Over the course of history, global trade flows have continually shifted. For instance, in the 1800s, Asia sat at the heart of global trade until the industrial revolution propelled North America and Europe ahead, eroding Asia’s share to a fraction of what it was before. Western nations continued to dominate trade up until the 1990s when another shift began to occur, this time towards emerging markets (EMs).</p>
<p>EMs now account for nearly half of world exports – up from one fifth in 1990. And according to the IMF one-third of the $15trn of global trade is now conducted between emerging and developing economies, known commonly as south-south trade.</p>
<p>At the heart of these new (or in many cases re-opening) global corridors is Asia. UNCTAD figures suggest that Asia now accounts for over 80% of all south-south exports and that nearly three-quarters of this figure can be attributed to Asian countries trading with each other. China is the engine of the region, accounting for 11.5% of global exports – surpassing the United States in 2013 as the world’s largest trading nation.</p>
<h3 id="north-becomes-south">North becomes South</h3>
<p>The changes in global trade flows cannot be attributed to one key factor; instead they are the result of a variety of shifts and events in the wider world over the past few decades. For starters, geopolitical developments such as the break-up of the Soviet Union and the opening up of emerging economies have played a significant role. Improvements and a reduction in the price of communication technology, thanks to the rise of the internet, has also played an important role in making the world smaller and more interconnected, while the creation of trade bodies such as the WTO in 1995 has looked to regulate global trade and allow it to flow freer and fairer.</p>
<p>Using these developments as a springboard, EMs have blossomed as their governments have liberalised trade, recognising the economic benefits afforded to them by adopting an export-led economy. For instance, countries such as China have been able to build up their capital account balances, drive international best practices domestically, improve the productivity and standards of local firms, bring more jobs and FDI and also increase their competitiveness on the global stage.</p>
<p>Regional and bi-lateral trade agreements, which have proliferated in recent years, have been used to further widen the new trade corridors. Agreements such as ASEAN in 1992 and NAFTA in 1994 and the creation of the single currency in the Eurozone in 1999 are some of the headline announcements. But bi-lateral agreements between emerging nations, whilst not always widely spoken about in the mainstream press, have been just as vital. As Nick Diamond, Head of Global Corporates, Transaction Banking Europe at Standard Chartered explains: “These agreements not only offer a number of benefits including a reduction in tariffs and tax charges, but underneath the agreements there is also a clear indication by these countries to allow investment and make it easier for corporates to do business there.”</p>
<p>With it now easier to do business in many EMs around the world, corporates have taken the opportunity to transform their supply chains and trade policies, adopting a model known as the vertical supply chain. In a vertical chain the basic functions in the production cycle are outsourced to countries with low labour costs and the higher skilled functions are kept in traditionally more high-skilled countries – Apple’s goods, for instance, are designed in California and assembled in China.</p>
<p>The other popular method, the horizontal supply chain, sees parts sourced from countries with similar wage levels where specialist skills are sought after. Aeroplane manufacturer Boeing is a prime example of this, as the company imports many of their parts from highly developed western economies such as the UK, as well as Japan, before assembling the plane in the US.</p>
<h3 id="changing-trade-instruments">Changing trade instruments</h3>
<p>Although corporates have undoubtedly reaped many cost benefits from the vertical supply chain model, it has also increased their complexity and risk. Supply chains of today often involve dozens and sometimes thousands of suppliers located around the world. This risk is magnified when one considers how many of these suppliers are located in emerging Asian markets.</p>
<p>Of course, dealing with companies in EMs can be a risky business. Non-payment, fraud, corruption, geo-political disruption and natural disasters are just a handful of the potential threats a company can be exposed to. As a result of this, corporate treasurers around the world are beginning to place increasing emphasis on understanding their trade flows and counterparties. “Historically in Europe treasurers touched on trade – but many didn’t see it as something core to their function,” says Peter Jameson, Co-head of Product Management, Global Transaction Services for EMEA at Bank of American Merrill Lynch (BofAML). “In the last few years however, we have really begun to see our clients think of risk mitigation solutions through trade as a requirement.”</p>
<p>Corporates are placing increasing focus on the trade instruments that they use both to finance trade and to mitigate risk. Although the new corridors haven’t changed the products which are available that much – letters of credit (LCs), risk mitigation techniques, guarantees and receivables solutions are all still widely available – there has been a change in the popularity of certain products. As Baihas Baghdadi, Managing Director, Head of Trade and Working Capital International at Barclays explains: “Some decades ago, LCs and bank guarantees were the most widely used trade instruments, no matter the size of the counterparty. Today, however, they are secondary in the conversation.” The most popular solution that corporates ask Barclays for now is the open account.</p>
<p>It may seem peculiar that the general trend in global trade, even sometimes in risky markets, is away from LCs – tools traditionally used to mitigate risk – and towards open account transactions where there is no protection. But there is a good reason for this. Kuresh Sarjan, Head of Asia Pacific Trade and Supply Chain Finance at BofAML, explains that “we have seen lots of clients bolster their own credit functions in recent years, as a result of this they have turned counterparty risk into an art form.” In doing so, corporates have been able to move away from pricey and document-heavy LCs and towards open account. “Should there be any question marks corporates might look to use risk mitigating products such as insurance, for the extra piece of mind.” It is worth noting, though, that whilst LCs are arguably decreasing in popularity, they are still a crucial factor in trade and also can serve as collateral in transactions.</p>
<p>The bank payment obligation (BPO) however, may be a tool which will radically transform the trade landscape. The solution functions similarly to the traditional LC, but utilises fully automated electronic transmissions to increase efficiency and enhance risk mitigation. Since the first BPO transaction took place between BP Aromatics and Oman-based Octal Petrochemicals in 2011 progress has been slow, despite the International Chamber of Commerce issuing rules to govern the solution in 2013.</p>
<p>Yet, in recent months the BPO has once again moved into the headlines, thanks in part to the recent BPO+ transaction which utilised full electronic documents to complete the transactions. With these new developments it is hoped that the solution will gain traction.</p>


<h3 id="manufacturing-moves-west">Manufacturing moves West</h3>
<p>The growth of vertical supply chains has transformed China and has seen the country nicknamed ‘the factory of the world’, sitting at the heart of many global supply chains. China has been able to take the lead in this regard because its vast population has allowed for huge volumes of output and also for labour costs to be kept low. In fact, the rise of China as a global supplier is staggering: in the 1990s, China produced less than 3% of global manufacturing output by value, but joining the WTO in 2001 proved to be the catalyst for economic and trade policy reforms which has propelled China into being the world’s largest exporter. The country produces nearly 25% of global goods.</p>
<p>But recent signs suggest China may be intentionally loosening its grip as the world’s manufacturing hub as it shifts towards a more consumption-based economy, looks to expand its service sector, and its middle class grows. These developments are seeing workers in China demanding higher wages and thus the cost of business is increasing.</p>
<p>With the vertical supply chain model being built on low-cost labour and materials, China’s attractiveness may therefore decline. “We are already seeing a shift in trade corridors because of this,” says Standard Chartered’s Diamond. “There are clear signs that manufacturing is moving west, away from China and into other countries primarily in the ASEAN region, such as Vietnam and the Philippines, and also India.” In fact, in July this year Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn announced that it would be looking to shift some of its manufacturing to India due to increasing costs in China.</p>
<p>This is not, however, an unexpected development. Asia operates under what Standard Chartered calls a ‘flying geese strategy’ where manufacturing moves away once a country reaches a certain economic level. This has already seen Korea and Taiwan, for instance, morph from low-cost manufacturing centres, to developers and consumers of sophisticated products and services. China, many experts now believe, is at this stage. It is expected that trade will therefore continue to move gradually east towards the Indian-subcontinent and eventually Africa as China continues to develop.</p>
<p>The sheer size of China does mean that it will still have a part to play in manufacturing moving forward, however. Its capacity is too large to be consumed entirely by other nations in the region. And despite its decreasing role in manufacturing, its presence in global trade looks set to increase. “China is repositioning itself to become a mega-trader and as a gateway to the new Silk Road linking up emerging markets and being at the centre of south-south trade. We are seeing the Chinese government investing heavily in this,” says Diamond.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<h3 id="the-case-for-flexibility">The case for flexibility</h3>
<p>Away from the instruments corporates can use, there has been an increasing focus in the years following the financial crisis around stable and sustainable supply chains as well as the need for flexibility. “Every change in the global environment brings along new opportunities but also new challenges,” says Barclays’ Baghdadi. For example, the recent political troubles in Thailand may have caused disruption to some supply chains, especially in the technology sectors. As a result of the increased risks, some firms in developed economies have begun to question whether the costs of outsourcing certain essential stages of the production process may outweigh the benefits.</p>
<p>“Corporates are therefore placing increasing emphasis on diversifying their supply chains and, in some cases, onshoring elements of the production process. This reduces the dependence on these suppliers and can save costs at times when oil prices are high due to the reduced need to transport the goods,” says Baghdadi. This may also be occurring, according to Baghdadi, due to the changing nature of consumer behaviour and the desire to reduce the time to market in the fast moving consumer goods sector.</p>
<p>Onshoring is something that Bart Ras, Global Head Business Development, Global Trade and Receivables Finance at HSBC is also seeing occur in the market. But this is not to say that offshoring is a thing of the past. “Corporates are developing hybrid supply chains that are extremely flexible. Some companies, for example, may decide to have 80% of the production process offshore to reap the benefits that this offers. Twenty percent may then be left closer to the market.” Ras is also seeing some corporates being strategic in their procurement as a way to reduce dependence on certain suppliers. “Some of our clients look to procure large volumes of stock from core suppliers, this gives them a buffer should the supplier suffer from difficulties, be it financial or otherwise. Dual-sourcing or even multi-sourcing where possible are other possible strategies.”</p>
<p>The changing demographics and economic situations of many Asian economies may also see corporates once again change their supply chain philosophy. As these markets modernise and become more consumer orientated, it may be pertinent to keep some manufacturing in these markets despite the increasing costs. The reason: these regional supply chains will help reduce the impact of currency volatility and also match the speed of change in client and consumer requirements. For Ras, it is those companies who really think about their supply chain and turn it into an art form that are the most successful in today’s world.</p>
<h3 id="supporting-the-supply-chain">Supporting the supply chain</h3>
<p>However, for corporates and their supply chains, there may be another risk looming. The glut of regulation that has been placed on the financial services industry, not least Basel III, has reduced the ability for banks to lend to smaller players, leaving a significant, and growing, financing gap. In Asia alone, the Asian Development Bank estimates that the gap is as much as $425bn. With key players in supply chains therefore struggling to keep their heads above water, what can larger corporates do to ensure of the health of their supply chain?</p>
<p>“We have seen an increased focus on the management of working capital since the financial crisis,” says HSBC’s Ras, “but what is becoming more important for more clients is the health of their supply chain, both up and down stream.” Corporates are beginning to actively monitor their counterparties’ liquidity positions and working capital to ensure they know if others are suffering from financial difficulties. This also provides insight into whether production can be accelerated or decelerated without causing difficulties.</p>
<p>One of the implications of Basel III, and shrinking bank lending, is that the responsibility of supporting supply chains financially is increasingly falling onto corporates. As a result, supply chain finance (SCF) is a product that many treasurers of large organisations are eager to explore. “In Asia, there is a fundamental shift towards SCF,” says BofAML’s Sarjan. “Often corporates are sitting on large cash reserves and are looking at ways to optimise this cash and in turn ensure the sustainability of their supply chain.”</p>
<p>The increasing interest in SCF is also occurring in Europe. “We are having lots of dialogue around the solution with our clients,” says BofAML’s Jameson. “It can be a long process and many clients have to spend a lot of time considering what it means for them, their customers and their suppliers.” Jameson is also keen to point out that in Europe there can be an important reputational angle to SCF and its impact on suppliers.</p>
<h3 id="an-ever-changing-world">An ever-changing world</h3>
<p>Whilst there may be a level of uncertainty around SCF, what is certain is that the importance of trade looks set to increase and corporates must make the most of changing dynamics. Big four consultancy firm EY expects that the value of global trade will continue to proliferate, predicting the total of goods traded to reach around $35trn in 2020, two and a half times the value of trade in 2010. EY also expects that the changing nature of global trade patterns, which increased following the global financial crisis, will continue.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, emerging Asia will play an ever-more critical role in global trade with manufacturing moving into the ASEAN region and the Indian subcontinent. Trade flows between China and India, for instance, are expected to account for one-fifth of global trade by 2020. We can also expect to see activity in Latin America and Africa increase as these regions continue to develop. “Africa has the potential to cause a seismic shift in global trade flows, but this will be down to a continued social, political and economic stability,” says BofAML’s Jameson. There are also lots of questions that remain around whether Africa can position itself as a low cost manufacturing region, in addition to the existing flows driven by infrastructure investment and flows of natural resources.</p>
<p>Of course, with the landscape continuing to evolve, support will be needed. “Every country is trying to promote trade,” says BofAML’s Sarjan. “So corporates need to be aware of the benefits and challenges posed by each market and ensure they are taking full advantage of these by adopting the correct solutions.” With this in mind, corporates should take extra care when choosing banking partners for their trade transactions, to ensure that they can support the organisation across these key markets.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>A number of misconceptions exist around dynamic discounting. Here, we aim to dispel these myths and get to the heart of why dynamic discounting can be beneficial for both buyers and suppliers.</em></p>
<p>Seven years on from the global financial crisis and the famed ‘fortress balance sheet’ of the corporate big boys still exists. In early 2014, a Deloitte study reported that a third of the world’s largest non-financial companies are sitting on a $2.8trn gross cash pile. But change is in the air and these corporate heavyweights are slowly beginning to soften, seeking a return on their cash buffer.</p>
<p>With the current low, zero and even negative interest rate environment making that task all the more challenging though, treasurers have to evaluate innovative methods to put their excess cash to work. Introducing a dynamic discounting scheme may be one such way that a corporate can look to achieve this, effectively leveraging their own balance sheet to generate additional purchasing discounts. Such a set-up also has the added bonus of providing suppliers with an earlier injection of cash and improving their working capital metrics.</p>
<p>But what exactly is dynamic discounting and how does it work?</p>
<h3 id="understanding-the-premise">Understanding the premise</h3>
<p>Dynamic discounting is a simple concept – the supplier offers a discount for an early payment and the earlier the payment the greater the discount. It is also by no means a new concept as John Keating, European Managing Director at Taulia explains: “The principle of offering a discount in return for an early payment has existed for a long time. The issue is that these schemes traditionally have been static.” For example, the 2/10 net 30 – a commonly used discount in the US – can be negotiated into a contract and offer the buyer the opportunity to pay a supplier on day ten, instead of day 30 and in turn receive a 2% discount. Yet this is not necessarily a great deal for suppliers: “because the discount is fixed within the terms of the contract, suppliers often feel that they have no control over it,” adds Keating. “Because of this they are often not keen to sign up to such an agreement unless there is a desperate need for the cash.”</p>
<p>Aside from the lack of control, the deal was often unfavourable to suppliers financially. “If a supplier is being paid on day ten and giving a 2% discount then they are essentially borrowing at 36% APR,” says Chris Dark, President International at C2FO. “Most suppliers, even today, will be able to borrow from a traditional lender for less than this.” While some corporate buyers tried to sweeten the deal and pay even earlier for a slightly larger discount, the APR remained at 24% and “eventually this just gets pushed into the cost of goods,” he adds.</p>
<p>Dynamic discounting is therefore the next step in the evolution of discounting and addresses some of the issues with the traditional model. Flexibility is key, in most cases the solution (generally speaking) allows buyers to choose an APR and offer this to their suppliers on a sliding scale based on how early they are paid. The APR can therefore fluctuate and is not tied to 24% like traditional models. Buyers have control because they are able to segment their suppliers based on a number of metrics and decide who should be offered what discount. Suppliers on the other hand also have an element of control because they are able to decide on a case-by-case business if the deal offered suits their needs. As Drew Hofler, Senior Director, Solutions Marketing at Ariba puts it: “a dynamic discounting solution is like an ATM for SMEs.”</p>
<p>It is worth noting that not all dynamic discounting solutions are the same. C2FO for example gives the suppliers the power to name their rates, not the buyer. “The supplier can change this daily to meet their ever changing cash needs,” says Dark. “In doing so we have created a marketplace that ebbs and flows constantly and the aim is not to charge high APRs and only have a small amount of players participate but have more players participate and charge less.”</p>
<h3 id="drivers-of-the-solution">Drivers of the solution</h3>
<p>Despite the obvious benefits, dynamic discounting cannot yet be seen as a mainstream solution, as C2FO’s Dark comments “there is a lot of noise, but still only a small number of companies have a large dynamic discounting solution.” But it is a solution that is gaining traction, not just because of economic necessity from businesses, but also because of advancements in and the rise of automation.</p>
<p>“To make dynamic discounting worthwhile there needs to be a convergence of opportunity and capability,” says Ariba’s Hofler. Firstly, let’s look at the opportunity. To make dynamic discounting work there has to be an opportunity for an early payment. “If it takes 30 days to clear an invoice then there will be no room for early payment,” he adds. “This means that best practice has to be introduced to the invoicing process, it needs to be automated, cleaned up and exceptions will need to be eliminated.” To do this, some companies have turned to e-invoicing solutions, and while these are not a necessity to ensure dynamic discounting works, it certainly helps in making sure invoices are approved as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The capability driver comes from making the solution automated and integrated. “Buyers don’t want to go through and make manual offers to thousands of suppliers, they want to set the parameters of what makes a good offer and then automate these to be sent to suppliers as soon as the invoice is approved,” says Hofler. “Suppliers then should be able to log-in to the portal and select if they want to take the offer or not, based on their current needs.”</p>
<p>There is also a political driver that has become more visible over the past few years. A number of governments have now introduced initiatives that seek to encourage buyers to pay their suppliers early – or in the case of the UK’s Prompt Payment Code to pay them on time. The most prominent of these initiatives is perhaps ‘Supplier Pay’ in the US, a programme mandated by the Obama administration that seeks to strengthen small businesses by increasing their working capital, so they can grow their businesses and benefit the economy by hiring more workers. Corporate heavyweights such as Apple, AT&amp;T, Coca Cola, IBM and Lockheed Martin have all pledged their support.</p>
<p>However the role that government has to play in encouraging such behaviour is contested. “Nobody argues that there is a big need for suppliers to receive more financing,” says C2FO’s Dark. “The debate stems from who should be solving this problem; while governments may launch these initiatives that pressure companies to pay early, they are unlikely to legislate on payment terms.” And when they do, as was the case with the EU who tried to legislate 60 day payment terms, there are often loopholes. “It therefore is corporates and their treasury teams that have a key role to play in pushing the solution, not governments,” adds Dark.</p>
<h3 id="the-business-case">The business case</h3>
<p>Of course, as is the case for any solution, there needs to be a business case for corporate adaption to occur. With dynamic discounting the main benefit for buyers is clear: paying early and receiving a discount is a way risk-free way to earn a return on cash that cannot be found elsewhere in the current low interest rate environment. In fact, this can be a considerable amount, Taulia estimates that dynamic discounting generates returns 50 times that of money market funds (MMFs) or T-bonds.</p>
<p>But there are other benefits for buyers that can supplement this. The implementation of a dynamic discounting solution can offer the treasury a chance to revaluate its entire working capital strategy and move away from post-crisis thinking. “If used correctly it also can be used as a way to fund large initiatives such as bringing all suppliers onto a P2P network,” says Ariba’s Hofler. “One of our clients, for example, funded their entire P2P solution suite from the gains made from dynamic discounting.”</p>
<p>There are also reputational benefits that large corporate buyers can gain from supporting their supply chain. With the political pressure and negative press around how corporates have acted in respect to paying their suppliers later and later, adopting such a solution can go some way to reverse the perception that large corporates are ‘bullies’. Also, by adopting the solution corporates can help to ensure the security of their key suppliers.</p>
<p>For sellers, the fundamental business case is also clear, access to cash when needed. But again there are other benefits. “Certainty and control are two things that all business crave around cash flow,” adds Hofler. “Suppliers are no different and the ability to have the control to access cash and the visibility over when this will arrive is invaluable when it comes to forecasting.”</p>
<h3 id="barriers-to-adoption">Barriers to adoption</h3>
<p>As previously mentioned, dynamic discounting is by no means a mainstream solution and there have been and, in some cases, remain barriers to adoption. One friction point in particular, and one that still many corporates struggle to see past, is the impact of paying a supplier early on important working capital metrics such as days payables outstanding (DPO) and the overall cash conversion cycle (CCC). “These are still important metrics for many corporates,” says C2FO’s Dark, “and it goes back to the crisis. The issue is that in many cases the board will have asked the treasury and finance department to improve these metrics, so in the past when we have come in with our solution some treasurers have balked because it touches these metrics. This is changing however as corporates are beginning to understand how dynamic discounting can be extremely flexible in helping to manage these metrics, in addition to adding to profitability.”</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>There are ways that a corporate can implement a dynamic discounting solution without touching its DPO, he explains. “We offer an enhanced discounting solution,” says Taulia’s Keating, “this provides the corporate with third-party cash (from institutional investors such as banks, pension funds and hedge funds) that can be used to make the early payment. This is an extension of traditional supply chain finance (SFC) and means that corporates’ DPO metrics are not impacted.”</p>
<p>Ariba’s Hofler approaches this debate from a different angle, however, and argues that – contrary to popular belief – a dynamic discounting solution can actually improve a corporate’s working capital metrics, including DPO. “I have had the conversation around working capital metrics with lots of corporates over the years and there is a recurring pattern,” he says. “They will often have hundreds of different payment terms with their suppliers. Some of these will be short and others long. But armed with dynamic discounting, treasurers have the opportunity in many cases to extend their payment terms with all their suppliers, based on the fact that they can use dynamic discounting should they have an issue with cash flow,” he says. “So if payment terms are extended to 45 days with 75% of suppliers and 25% accept early payment, 50% will still be on 45 days, so what we normally see is that corporates are able to increase their DPO by four to six days net.”</p>
<p>Working capital metrics, however, are not the only hurdle. There may also be a challenge on-boarding suppliers to a dynamic discounting programme, especially those who have had issues with static discounting in the past. Also, if the relationship at the supplier is with the sales department, it is likely that the contact will not be motivated by cash flows, but by price. Treasury will therefore need to find a counterpart at the supplier who speaks the same language in order to really ‘sell’ the solution to them.</p>
<p>Also, there can be tax and accounting issues based around VAT. Nevertheless, dynamic discounting vendors generally recognise this and have teamed up with tax specialists to provide assistance, or in some cases have worked with the tax authorities to streamline the process for corporate clients.</p>
<h3 id="a-dynamic-future">A dynamic future</h3>
<p>Dynamic discounting, just as its name suggests is a solution that is constantly developing, with a number of providers approaching it in slightly different ways. So what does the future hold for the solution?</p>
<p>Taulia’s Keating expects its popularity to increase as businesses’ attitudes change and more corporates adopt the solution. “With critical mass it has the potential to revolutionise the early payments space,” he says. “What will get us there is education. The level of familiarity with the solution is lower in Europe compared to the US and this needs to change.” Keating also highlights dynamic discounting solution providers are only just beginning to harness the data that created with the solution. “There is huge potential for this moving forward to impact profoundly how corporates approach relationships with their suppliers and allow them to make smart and informed business decisions.”</p>
<p>Similarly to Keating, Ariba’s Hofler also expects the solution to grow in popularity. However, he expects it to be just one cog in a large revolution around payables. “There currently are lots of discrete solutions that are used in the payments process,” he says. “And this has been fine for a number of years, but as business are becoming more intimately networked many organisations are seeing the benefits of marry all of these on a network. We are working to get invoicing, tied with discount and third party financing and then tying this with the execution of the payment so everything is automated, seamless and all the data is rich and fully visible to all parties involved.”</p>


<blockquote>There is huge potential for this moving forward to impact profoundly how corporates approach relationships with their suppliers and allow them to make smart and informed business decisions.</blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source">John Keating, European Managing Director, Taulia</p>


<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>While again, unsurprising, thinking the dynamic discounting market will grow, C2FO’s Dark believes that it has the potential to develop into a vibrant marketplace, similar to the stock market. “Working capital should be a very tradable commodity,” he says. “It should be able to be securitised just like many other financial assets.” Also, Dark believes that smaller suppliers can offer the solution to their suppliers. “If the solution becomes ubiquitous then this will have a profound impact, and cash will flow down supply chains in seconds rather than the few years it currently takes. This could add trillions of dollars to global GDP.”</p>

<p>Richard Hite, Vice President, Supplier Finance joined Barclays in 2011 as a Supplier Finance product specialist. Hite has over 25 years of experience in banking, largely in relationship management, both in the US and the UK. He has also served as European Treasurer for a US Group as well as worked for independent Supplier Finance companies. He has a degree in Economics.</p>

<p>Companies continue to face significant economic and competitive pressures and, as a result, are increasingly focused on cash generation. Buying organisations are also increasingly aware of supplier risk and the reliance they have on their suppliers. What is more, procurement often represents the largest spend within a company and many companies believe there is value that may be extracted. This may come from improved efficiencies as well as from reducing the amount of capital tied up in working capital.</p>
<p>As such, most companies have working capital initiatives and targets. These are usually focused on improving their net working capital position, reducing their cash conversion cycle and reducing costs. There are various means of achieving these targets with the most straightforward ones being either to accelerate the collection of cash or to extend payment terms. Simply put, companies want to hold onto cash longer by paying later while getting paid earlier.</p>
<p>Large corporate buyers are aware of the consequences of paying their suppliers later and, with supplier risk and Corporate Social Responsibility becoming increasingly important, they are conscious of the need to support their suppliers. Suppliers are under similar financial pressures and many would benefit from the ability to accelerate the collection of cash.</p>
<p>Because of these competing interests, there is the possibility of a conflict between companies and their suppliers. One potential solution to this challenge is supplier finance.</p>
<h3 id="a-buyer-led-solution">A buyer-led solution</h3>
<p>There are various products available to suppliers to accelerate the collection of cash and not wait until the invoice due date to be paid. The most common include receivables financing and invoice discounting. Supplier finance distinguishes itself from these products by being buyer-led rather than supplier-led. It also offers improved efficiencies and quicker processing.</p>
<p>For buyers seeking to extend payment terms, their reluctance is due to the potential impact longer payment terms will have on their suppliers. The primary impact is the additional costs that the supplier will incur as a result of having to wait longer to be paid. Most suppliers will seek to recoup these costs from the buyer by raising prices.</p>
<p>Supplier finance removes the cash flow impact – and the cost impact – of extended payment terms. The cash flow impact is mitigated because suppliers have the ability to accelerate the collection of receivables in exchange for an early discounted cash payment – in effect, suppliers are able to get paid early. The cost impact is mitigated because the discount charge, or price, the bank charges is calculated using the buyer’s cost of funds and not the supplier’s. The interest rate arbitrage opportunity or differential between a buyer’s cost of funds and a supplier’s cost of funds is usually sufficient that it results in a lower financing cost for suppliers despite the longer payment terms.</p>
<p>The early discounted cash payment is the approved invoice amount less the discount charge. The bank has recourse to the buyer and not the supplier thus the reason the financing charge is calculated using the buyer’s cost of funds. On the due date, the buyer pays 100% of the approved invoice amount. It is a simple calculation to compare the costs and quantify the financial benefits to the supplier.</p>

<p>Supplier finance is sometimes called ‘reverse factoring’ or ‘confirming’ – the latter is used in the Spanish market where the idea was originally conceived over 20 years ago. From rather humble origins, supplier finance has grown into a globally recognised solution. Today, rather than just ‘noise’ around the subject, experts are starting to see a genuine uptake in supplier finance activity in the corporate sector.</p>
<p>According to a report released in February 2014 by the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) and Aite Group, the current global market size for supplier finance is estimated to be between $255 billion and $280 billion. “Despite its already impressive growth, the potential for further expansion in the market as more buyers and suppliers come to realise the mutual benefits of supplier finance is significant,” says Richard Hite, Vice President, Supplier Finance, Barclays.</p>
<p>“As the solution matures, the business case is becoming much clearer and the misconceptions around it are being dispelled,” he adds. “Supplier finance is not about buyers coercing suppliers to accept longer payment terms with little or no regard for the financial strain that places them under – that is not our experience. Supplier finance is very transparent and there are not any hidden costs. It’s quite a straightforward product that, when successfully implemented, produces real benefits for both parties,” notes Hite.</p>
<h3 id="reaping-the-rewards">Reaping the rewards</h3>
<p>For most buyers, they need to extend payment terms to derive any tangible benefit. To quantify the benefit, a 30 day extension will generate £8.2m of working capital benefit per £100m of spend. But it’s not just about payment term extension. Hite comments: “In addition to the working capital benefits, supplier finance provides enhanced visibility and improved control over payments and collections, and supplier enquiries are often reduced, which may lower administration costs. Many companies are beginning to see supplier finance as providing a competitive advantage”.</p>
<p>Supplier finance also reduces the buyer’s supply chain risk. According to Hite, “suppliers gain access to low cost, non-recourse cash, which is valuable to many of them”.</p>
<p>For the supplier, the main benefits are driven from their ability to effect an early payment. This allows suppliers to improve their net working capital position, shorten their cash conversion cycle and reduce costs. The opportunity to view approved invoices, confirmed payment amounts and the due dates on-line are an added benefit.</p>
<p>The cost of financing is also typically lower than the cost of finance arranged directly with a bank. Supplier finance is also generally cheaper than other, more traditional, forms of supply chain finance such as factoring or invoice discounting and there is no recourse to the supplier.</p>
<p>Finally, using a supplier finance platform compared to invoice or receivables discounting, introduces a highly automated technology solution compared to what is often a largely paper-based process. This improves visibility, control and reporting functionality for both buyers and suppliers, while promoting process efficiency.</p>

<h3 id="getting-on-board">Getting on board</h3>
<p>For buying organisations that have decided to establish a supplier finance programme, choosing the right provider and solution is critical to success. This might sound a fairly simple process but it is actually not that straightforward. The decision is really driven by your requirements and what you need from a provider, and there are a number of factors to assess.</p>
<p>Hite says, “there are a number of important considerations. These include relationship, experience, approach and methodology. Depending on your geographic requirements, footprint may be a deciding factor. Credit appetite is another important consideration. Finally, don’t underestimate supplier on-boarding. It is often overlooked with implementation frequently being the focus, however supplier on-boarding is probably the most important consideration”. And as Simon Enticknap, Director, Trade and Working Capital at Barclays notes, “there is an increasing polarisation around the choice of provider and platform. Is it better to choose a proprietary solution or to look for more neutral technology? Corporates are understandably torn between the two.”</p>
<p>In Hite’s view, relationship plays an important role in making the right decision. “Buyers should seek a provider that understands their objectives and requirements. They should avoid a situation where a supplier finance programme is successfully implemented only to find further down the line that the funding is being withdrawn. Relationship banks that have a broad relationship with a buyer are likely to be more inclined to work with and support their client and its suppliers, particularly in a downturn.”</p>
<p>Understanding the buyer’s objectives is essential because it drives the entire process. The provider will take on board the client’s objectives when it conducting its working capital analysis and in developing a supplier on-boarding strategy. An analysis of the buyer’s spend with suppliers is key to a successful programme. The provider is able to quantify the benefits of supplier finance both to buyers and suppliers and calculate other financial metrics, including building a business case. This should be formally presented to the buyer along with a recommended best solution. “The buyer is making part of its credit limit available to these suppliers, so it is absolutely natural for the buyer to ensure that it is getting maximum value out of the arrangement,” Enticknap points out.</p>
<h3 id="supplier-finance-at-barclays">Supplier finance at Barclays</h3>
<p>“We have a team of dedicated experts who work closely with the buyer to offer a solution that is aligned, and specifically tailored, to their working capital needs. Our approach is consultative and collaborative,” says Enticknap. “We also do all of the on-boarding legwork.”</p>
<p>Once the implementation of the Barclays programme is complete and suppliers have been on-boarded, it is a highly efficient process and very light touch. This is how it works on a day-to-day level:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The supplier submits their invoice to the buyer for approval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The buyer approves the invoice and electronically transmits the payment instruction to Barclays. The payment instruction is the buyer’s commitment to make a payment of a specific amount on a date in future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The supplier is notified that their invoice has been approved by email and can view the data online, including the invoice details, amount due and the confirmed payment date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The supplier has the option to request an early discounted cash payment electronically via the platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon Barclays’ acceptance of the request for discount, the net amount will be credited to the supplier’s designated bank account within 48 hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the payment due date, Barclays debits the buyer for the full invoice amount.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the supplier has not submitted an early payment request, Barclays pays the supplier the full amount on the due date.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="setting-up-your-supplier-finance-programme-best-practice-for-buyers">Setting up your supplier finance programme: best practice for buyers</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Find a provider committed to understanding your objectives and which completes an analysis of your spend. This will quantify the financial metrics, build the business case for supplier finance and identify suitable suppliers. It will also assist in developing the supplier on-boarding strategy. Most importantly, the output from this analysis will confirm if supplier finance is appropriate for your business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider all aspects of a provider’s offering. A great deal of attention is on implementation, for example, however supplier on-boarding is essential to a successful programme and perhaps the most important aspect. The provider’s approach and methodology and ‘after-sales support’ should be assessed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Key internal stakeholder buy-in is essential. Finance, procurement, legal and IT must all be committed to the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obtain auditor sign off for accounting treatment before implementation. Buyers want their trade payables to remain classified as trade payables, not reclassified as debt, as does your bank.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Form a project team and appoint an internal project champion. The team should include representatives from finance, procurement, legal and IT. The project champion will drive the programme within the buyer’s organisation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Internally communicate the details of the supplier finance programme ensuring every party understands their responsibilities and the benefits from their own functional perspective. Engaging internal stakeholders at every level is vital to the programme’s success.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Choosing an experienced, committed and reliable provider that understands your requirements and objectives as well as having the credit appetite to support your programme, should be among the key considerations. Pricing is often a key differentiator but when evaluating a provider, it is actually one of the least important considerations.</p>

<h3 id="evolution-and-future">Evolution and future</h3>
<p>Now that companies are quite comfortable with the premise of supplier financing, we are also seeing some interesting tweaks to the vanilla model, Enticknap believes. “A handful of companies actually have in place self-invest programmes, which essentially put them in charge of buying their own risk. Others are looking further into the area of rebates and how these can be leveraged more effectively. So there is a lot of interesting and creative thinking going on in this space and the product continues to mature at an impressive pace,” he notes.</p>
<p>Likewise, the wider supply chain and trade marketplace continues to come of age. With the bank payment obligation (BPO) slowly gaining traction and e-invoicing now being integrated into supply chain solutions, the way companies carry out their commercial transactions is certainly changing. What remains constant, however, is the need for intelligent finance solutions that enable companies to maximise value across the supply chain.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Different banks and providers use myriad names for it – some misleading or even erroneous. Little surprise then that there is often confusion around what supplier finance actually is. Referred to by many under the generic supply chain finance (SCF) banner, and by others as ‘reverse factoring’, supplier finance is actually a form of receivables-driven financing that is initiated by the buyer, through their relationship bank(s).</p>
<p>A balance sheet efficient solution, supplier finance works by allowing the supplier to leverage the buyer’s credit rating and access an agreed percentage of the due payment up front from the bank. It is described as a ‘win-win’ since, in return, the buyer is able to extend out payment terms or benefit from early settlement discounts, safe in the knowledge that their supplier is being supported financially – and that there is no arrangement fee to pay.</p>
<p>Despite the obvious benefits, “a number of misconceptions still exist around supplier finance,” says Rene Chinnery, Head of Supply Chain Finance, Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking. “On the buyer side, there is a fairly widespread perception that supplier finance programmes require a great deal of systems integration, for example. That’s simply not the case. All that needs to happen is for a report to be written and the file to be exported from the company’s standard accounts payable system.”</p>
<p>On the supplier side, continues Chinnery, “the main misconception that we encounter is that ‘there must be a catch’ – it seems too good to be true. But supplier finance is referred to as a ‘win-win’ solution for very good reason.”</p>
<p>Somewhat ironically however, it is precisely this ‘win-win’ label that seems to be one of the factors holding supplier finance back. After all, when a bank comes knocking at your door promising a solution that works in favour of all parties, it’s only natural to feel a little suspicious. As Anil Walia, Head of Supply Chain Finance, Global Transaction Services, RBS notes: “There is still a lack of education on the mutual benefits of supplier finance, so there is a certain amount of insecurity around the way it works – not least the fact that it is a form of off-balance sheet financing.”</p>
<p>In many senses, these psychological barriers are the most difficult to overcome. As supplier finance becomes more deeply embedded in the consciousness of treasurers and procurement professionals, however, the rationale for such programmes should seem increasingly obvious to both buyers and suppliers – these mental barriers will shrink. And as more and more supplier finance programmes become a success, momentum will only continue to gather. But how can corporate buyers make their supplier finance programme one of these success stories?</p>
<h3 id="get-your-ducks-in-a-row">Get your ducks in a row</h3>
<p>The first step towards supplier finance success is getting internal buy-in and making sure that all the relevant departments within the corporate are ready for the programme to begin. According to Oliver Petersen, Global Head Supply Chain Finance, ING, “one of the main challenges is internal alignment. If a large buyer is not ready from an internal perspective to implement a supplier finance programme, it is unlikely that the rollout will achieve maximum efficiency.”</p>
<p>There is a dialogue which needs to happen within the corporate, he says. “It’s not a very ‘typical’ conversation because it actually requires the alignment of people from treasury, procurement, the IT department, and accounting and legal as well. In our experience, it is very beneficial if this alignment is also supported from top down. You need upper level management support, from the CEO to the CFO.”</p>
<p>RBS’s Walia agrees, saying: “Every buyer has its own environment, both internally and externally, and that is actually what creates the challenge when implementing a supplier finance programme. Corporates often still work in siloes and different departments will have varied, and sometimes conflicting, KPIs.”</p>
<p>The approach that Petersen advises is “for KPIs to be implemented in line with the rollout to keep track of accountability. These KPIs could range from implementation dates to cash flow targets.” He adds that: “A well-structured supply chain finance programme tends to generate free cash flow more quickly and generally grows larger than those programmes that are not so thoroughly thought through. This is because people are more engaged – and once the benefits start to show, everyone is motivated to continue.”</p>
<p>Internal timing of the programme is another critical success factor, since supplier finance requires so many different corporate departments to come together and work collaboratively on the project. “If it begins in November for example, it is likely that delays will happen as the company will be busy setting up its annual report for the following year,” Walia explains.</p>

<h3 id="auchan-a-shining-example">Auchan: a shining example</h3>

<h4 class="fn">Arnaud Crouzet</h4>
<h5 class="title">Head of Group Global Payments Development</h5>
<img alt="Auchan" class="logo org" height="20" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/auchan-logo-2014-90x20.png" width="90"/>

<p><em>Arnaud Crouzet joined the Auchan Group in 2010 as Head of Group Global Payments Development. He is also General Manager of Auchan Suppliers Advanced Platform SA (ASAP SA), the company in charge of managing the Group’s supplier finance programme. Here, Arnaud explains how the programme came about and what factors have contributed to its success.</em></p>
<p>Back in 2010, requests began coming in from suppliers across the different countries in which Auchan operates to assist with earlier payment of their invoices. This was in large part due to the difficult credit environment at the time. Some suppliers were asking for factoring arrangements, while others were looking to negotiate reduced payment terms. Since Auchan has very strong and valued relationships with its suppliers, the company’s treasury function began looking into possible solutions.</p>
<p>“We analysed a number of possibilities, but it was reverse factoring that seemed to tick all the boxes,” says Crouzet. Given that there were few large scale supplier finance programmes in the market at the time, there were some initial hurdles to overcome. “What we found was that many of the reverse factoring programmes that were out there were beneficial for the buyer, but not so interesting for the suppliers. Certain programmes virtually forced suppliers to join. But we felt that this was not a fair approach and it certainly didn’t match the Group’s philosophy,” he explains.</p>
<p>“What we were looking for was something open, transparent and flexible that we could offer to all of our suppliers. We wanted a programme that suppliers could decide to use – or not use – however they wanted.” Additionally, Auchan needed a solution that would operate on a multi-country, multi-currency, multi-bank and multi-lingual basis. The best way to achieve this, it was decided, would be to manage the programme in-house, rather than outsourcing it to a third party.</p>
<p>A significant number of RFPs were sent out to gather information on the type of platform that would best meet the company’s requirements – whether it be an out-of-the-box solution or something bespoke. “We wanted to get the broadest possible view of the market, so the RFPs were sent out to banks and software vendors not only in Europe but also in the US and Asia. It was a huge amount of work, but it was definitely worth the effort,” says Crouzet.</p>
<p>What the research highlighted was the importance of a platform that would not only meet the company’s needs from a buyer/supplier perspective, but also from a treasury perspective. After consideration, Auchan chose to work with Kyriba to deliver the platform as the vendor was able to respond to all of the requirements set out in the RFP through its white-label offering, while addressing the need for integration with the treasury workflow. “We were pleasantly surprised by Kyriba’s response to our RFP. Only knowing the company by name, we spoke with some other corporates who were using Kyriba’s treasury software and the feedback was extremely positive. As such, we chose to run a pilot programme with Kyriba.”</p>
<p>A handful of companies were involved in the pilot, and it went very smoothly so Auchan was soon able to expand its reverse factoring programme. “The programme is currently live across several different countries and Auchan entities, with many different suppliers now onboard. On the whole, our suppliers are very pleased with the programme – we can see that from the level of uptake and the fact that once they are live with one Auchan entity, they are asking to go live with others. The platform gives them a single window on their transactions with the entire group. It also gives them a lot of flexibility – they can ask for payment manually or automatically, specifying their requested payment date. They also know exactly how much to expect, which helps them with their cash flow forecasting,” he notes.</p>
<p>Auchan chose to work with multiple banks to provide the financing for its supplier finance programme and this provides an extra level of flexibility for suppliers. “We arranged it so that the suppliers can access funds at a very reasonable rate – and through their bank of choice.”</p>
<p>It is precisely this flexibility and transparency that Crouzet believes has made the programme such a success. “Nothing is imposed on our suppliers. They are free to use the programme if they wish, or to leave it if they wish. What you see is what you get – there is no hidden agenda. For me, this is vital to make a real success of reverse factoring.”</p>
<p>Another key success factor, he believes, is the intuitive and user-friendly supplier portal, which Auchan has worked with Kyriba to enhance. “Financial software is often over-complicated. We wanted something very simple, so that no specific training would be required to use it. Not only have we achieved this easy-to-use functionality – suppliers can request payment in just two clicks – but it looks great too,” Crouzet explains. The supplier portal is also available 24/7.</p>
<p>For other companies thinking about implementing a supplier finance programme, Crouzet has the following advice: “Don’t forget the legal side of things. This can be extremely complicated and it’s very important to get it right, so make sure you allocate sufficient time and resources to that. Marketing the benefits of reverse factoring to suppliers is also key – if you make the business case clear to suppliers, this will help to speed up the onboarding process. However, I must re-emphasise the importance of not forcing suppliers to join the programme. A fair approach is always best.”</p>

<h3 id="choose-the-right-partner">Choose the right partner</h3>
<p>Although there are a handful of large corporates that run their own supplier finance programmes, without the help of a banking partner or third party provider, the vast majority do have external involvement. What is more, the choice of provider can have a significant impact on the seamlessness of the programme’s implementation and its overall success.</p>
<p>The challenge here is, as Walia puts it, that: “All of the supply chain providers can talk the talk, but which of them can deliver? That’s a key question for the treasurer to consider.” Looking at implementation times and previous experience in the space will help the treasurer here. “Those providers that have established themselves well in supply chain finance now have quite streamlined business propositions in this field. From an RBS perspective, five years ago, it used to take us two to three months to put in place the connectivity between the buyer and our system – now it takes all of ten days,” says Walia.</p>
<p>But it is not just the buyer’s implementation experience that matters in the overall context of ‘success’. The partner bank’s standards and practices around supplier onboarding are also vital, and again these vary greatly from institution to institution – not least where documentation is concerned. “At RBS, our supplier documentation is simple and ranges between two and a half and four pages, depending on the jurisdiction,” he notes. It is not uncommon for documentation to run into double figures, however, and this can be extremely daunting for smaller or family-owned suppliers.</p>
<p>The way that banks approach supplier onboarding can also have a significant impact on uptake. “Some banks believe that suppliers can be onboarded through overseas call centres,” says Chinnery. “That’s not Lloyds Bank’s philosophy. We have a team of experts on hand to support the onboarding process at every step. What is more, they understand how each supplier’s business works and where supplier finance fits within that.”</p>
<p>Jacqueline Keogh, Managing Director of Global Trade, Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, re-emphasises the benefits of this: “Each supplier has the support of a named point of contact at Lloyds Bank who is equipped with the knowledge to answer all their questions. We establish relationships with every supplier; they are never ‘just another number’.”</p>
<p>RBS’s Walia supports this philosophy, adding that: “There needs to be a relationship of trust between each supplier and the bank, too. Before suppliers join an RBS programme, we assure them that we will not use their data to approach them for any other business – it’s a question of mutual respect.”</p>
<p>The right banking partner can also help to overcome any concerns the supplier might have, or iron out creases in the plan. Petersen explains that one such hurdle might be “if the supplier has existing financing in place that has essentially locked up the company’s assets as security – meaning that all of the receivables can’t be pledged.” In this case, he says, “we would urge the supplier to go back to its lenders to either waive the overall requirement or ask for a basket in terms of what they can approve. After all, supplier finance brings in cash more quickly for the supplier, so it’s in the best interests of both the supplier and its lenders.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere, having a professional third party service provider, who has experience in implementing supplier finance programmes, either engage in a benchmarking or business case exercise or simply validate what the corporate buyer has in mind, can also be extremely valuable in ensuring the programme is a success for everyone, Petersen believes.</p>
<h3 id="support-your-suppliers">Support your suppliers</h3>
<p>Ensuring suppliers are on side and up-to-speed with supplier finance is not just up to the provider, however. For Keogh, “a successful supplier finance programme is largely determined by the level of buyer engagement and support in promoting it. Some buyers are very restrictive around which suppliers they will allow to join, while others have been known to give their suppliers no choice but to participate. In our experience, best practice constitutes a supportive buyer who encourages supplier uptake, without making the programme mandatory.”</p>
<p>Walia echoes this sentiment, saying: “In the spirit of best practice, the buyer should not be influencing suppliers by pushing them to join a programme. That said, much can be done around educating suppliers about the benefits of supplier finance.”</p>
<p>This education might not be the typical ‘small supplier’ conversation, either. “If you have a supplier which is stronger rated than the buyer,” explains ING’s Petersen, “supplier finance can be a great risk management tool. Take a company that has just been acquired by a private equity firm, for example. All of a sudden, the credit metrics don’t stack up – and if there is no credit insurance available, supplier finance is a very quick and efficient way to de-risk.”</p>
<h3 id="embrace-technology">Embrace technology</h3>
<p>The kind of technology that a supplier finance programme leverages can also have a significant impact on its success and uptake. User-friendliness is imperative. “When it comes to platforms, simplicity is key,” says Lloyds Bank’s Chinnery. “While our platform has global reach, is multi-currency and is available in multiple languages, we have never had to provide on-site training to a supplier because it’s so intuitive.”</p>
<p>Indeed, when looking to implement a supplier finance programme at French international retail group Auchan, the company knew that, among other key ingredients, the right technology platform would make a real difference to the overall outcome – as the case study opposite clearly illustrates.</p>
<h3 id="play-the-long-game">Play the long game</h3>
<p>A final word of advice for both corporates and banks in the supplier finance space is to think to the future. After all, supplier finance aims to build sustainable supply chains. According to Petersen, “it’s all about the long-term view – this is not something that you put in place just for one or two years, it’s about understanding how the client is developing and what the future business case is.”</p>
<p>Keogh adds that: “Longer-term, the industry will need to further analyse and respond to the need for cross-border supply chain finance. While FI networks and partnerships are becoming more collaborative and transparent, cross-border supplier finance is most definitely an area that deserves greater attention going forward.”</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Establishing a distributor finance (DF) programme may not be at the top of too many corporate treasurers’ to-do lists for 2014. But as many small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) distributors continue to struggle to find affordable and flexible credit, DF could be the key to unlocking growth for both the corporate seller and its distributors. So what exactly is DF and how does it work?</p>
<p>An alternative financing technique that can complement traditional supply chain finance (SCF), DF can be defined, according to Demica, as: “Financing solutions that support the working capital needs of a corporate seller’s distributors and potentially the distributors’ resellers, to ease the flow of product through the channel.” In other words, DF allows the large corporate seller’s bank relationships, credit strength and knowledge of its channel partners (in this case, distributors) to be leveraged in order to provide affordable finance to the downstream supply chain.</p>
<p>This is important because “a lot of these channel partners are typically less well capitalised than the larger manufacturing entity – what we call the anchor client – for this reason they really need more flexible working capital than they could normally access on their own,” says Jon Richman, Head of Trade Finance and Financial Supply Chain Americas at Deutsche Bank.</p>
<p>Often offered on a short-term basis, DF essentially allows corporate sellers to grow their sales by injecting working capital and liquidity into their distribution channel. This in turn allows the seller to improve its cash flow, and lower its risk while enabling its distributors to purchase more product by giving them access to an additional source of funding at a lower cost than traditional bank financing. DF can also reduce counterparty credit risk, and improves performance metrics, although this is not the primary reason that most corporate sellers turn to the solution.</p>
<p>There are three main types of DF solutions. The first is a receivables-based programme, which allows the corporate seller to receive early payment through the purchase or discounting of receivables – the benefit is then passed on to distributors in the form of extended payment terms (increased DPO). Another method sees distributors provided with direct loans or credit facilities that are backed (to a varying extent) by the anchor client. Finally, other asset-backed financing may be provided, again with backing from the anchor client. A good example of this is dealer floor plan financing in the automotive industry.</p>
<h3 id="capital-hungry-distributors">Capital-hungry distributors</h3>
<p>Early adopters of DF programmes included carmakers, technology companies (Dell and HP, for example, have well established DF programmes in place) and some industrial sectors, such as equipment manufacturers. Nevertheless, the range of industries in which DF programmes can be applied is wide – it includes consumer products, food and beverages, and chemicals companies.</p>
<p>“DF programmes are generally applicable anywhere where there’s an imbalance of power between the anchor and its distributors, where the anchor client – often a large manufacturer with a lot of leverage and a good credit standing – uses distributors who are not as well capitalised,” adds Richman.</p>
<p>“Industries where there is a tendency to outsource services, where there is a strong demand for stocks of spare parts in a short time, or cases where an original equipment manufacturer takes on a service guarantee for its own products, are likely to increasingly look to DF programmes in the future,” says Sigurd Dahrendorf, Vice President, Corporate Treasury at Knorr-Bremse. Rail companies operating in countries like Sweden and the UK, where rail traffic is liberalised, very often have these attributes.</p>
<p>“DF is most attractive to corporates with international supply chains, particularly those looking to expand into emerging markets,” says Phillip Kerle, CEO at Demica. Successful DF programmes can help propel corporates into markets or segments where they want greater reach, as well as allowing smaller distribution partners to grow in their own right. Demica identified Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America as regions where there are already a number of DF programmes running in a DF report last year. It went on to say that Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Russia, South America and the Far East should provide scope for DF development in the future.</p>
<h3 id="limited-provision">Limited provision</h3>
<p>Despite the apparent usefulness of DF, the provision of services is still somewhat limited. “There are not as many providers as one would think,” says Richman. “Apart from those few, the options are limited to smaller, local banks that have traditional ways of extending credit, usually on a bilateral basis, to the local distributors they have established relationships with.”</p>
<p>But the big bank DF providers have a different approach. They look at the relationships their major anchor clients have with their distributors, financing only the transactions that take place between the two. “We take the view that if it’s a close relationship, and if the distributor is prioritising the obligations they have to the anchor over other obligations, then the credit risk we are taking in financing those transactions is less than the credit risk we’d be taking if we just had a traditional bilateral relationship with that distributor,” says Richman.</p>
<p>This effectively lower credit risk enables the DF provider to extend more flexible credit and more of it, often at better prices, than would ever be possible through a traditional bilateral arrangement.</p>
<p>Thomas Dunn, Chairman of supply chain finance company Orbian, agrees that there is still something of a dearth of banks providing DF programmes. “It’s a bit like supply chain finance services. A lot of the big banks tend to talk it up a lot, but the actual amount of dollars they are putting behind DF is still really rather modest.”</p>
<p>Rather than being offered as a standalone service, DF services are often combined with bank providers’ other products as part of their global relationship with clients, and are usually adapted to the nature of the industry concerned. DF schemes are typically funded on-balance sheet by banks, and can be syndicated with other banks if the deal is material enough to pose capital requirement concerns.</p>
<h3 id="industry-participants">Industry participants</h3>
<p>DF is principally the domain of global banks which have a highly developed trade finance business. This international expertise differentiates them from local, domestic banks who can find providing these cross-border facilities a challenge.</p>
<p>There are also non-banks that provide DF, who are typically big manufacturers that have developed their finance operations. The key advantage of these non-bank DF providers is that they tend to have a very strong understanding of the underlying goods involved. GE Capital, for example, provides customised DF programmes wherein it manages its manufacturing clients’ financial relationships with their distribution networks.</p>
<p>Furthermore there are a handful of technology and service companies in the DF space. These companies do not typically provide credit for DF, but rather facilitate programmes through a technology platform.</p>
<p>Dahrendorf believes the paucity of provision is to an extent due to the level of demand for such services. “The market for DF services is not as strong as for traditional supply chain finance solutions. There is perhaps the perception that DF programmes offer less benefits than traditional SCF solutions.”</p>

<h3 id="what-to-look-for-in-a-df-provider">What to look for in a DF provider</h3>
<p>Choosing a DF provider with a robust credit process in place, one that takes the nature of the relationship between the counterparties into account, is key to addressing credit risk.</p>
<p>DF programmes can also pose a variety of operational risks to the provider, owing to the diverse funding flows, reporting requirements, activity reconciliation, and management of credit notes involved. Providers of DF therefore need to have a solid infrastructure, including a technical platform, in place to support this operational complexity.</p>
<p>However, the financial risks of DF are partly mitigated by the fact that the counterparties involved have core relationships with the underlying client. “There’s a high degree of operational integration and a far more profound relationship, so if there is any disruption on the credit side or on the financing side, it can be managed within the context of the corporate’s overall goods and services relationship with the distributor. There’s a lot less risk for the corporate than there would be, for example, for a financial institution that was trying to provide this directly to the distributors,” says Dunn.</p>

<h3 id="compliance-considerations">Compliance considerations</h3>
<p>This somewhat negative perception of DF is not helped by the fact that DF is often conducted on an international basis, meaning that there are certain compliance challenges. However, compliance is almost always handled by the DF provider, not the corporate client. For providers, KYC – the client, their industry, and their distributors – is essential. The challenge of collecting this data is amplified when especially large pools of distributors are involved.</p>
<p>Providers must be diligent in ensuring that central bank regulatory reporting requirements and tax considerations are taken into account. While major global banks offering DF programmes usually have the infrastructure in place to deal with cross-border compliance issues, this challenge is more difficult for smaller domestic banks to address. Corporates weighing up DF providers should bear this in mind.</p>
<p>“It really depends on the jurisdiction. Some countries, for example, have regulations covering the financing or purchase of receivables or inventory, while others may require you to have some kind of financing licence in order to have a DF programme. You need to look at it on a case-by-case basis,” adds Dunn.</p>
<h3 id="keeping-an-eye-on-risk">Keeping an eye on risk</h3>
<p>Richman’s advice in setting up a DF programme: choose the distributors you put on the DF programme carefully. Ideally they should be trusted partners the corporate intends to keep for a long time. This should keep the risk to the corporate seller to a minimum. A sound knowledge of the territories in which it has distributors can also help the corporate seller when it comes to arranging a programme with a provider.</p>
<p>Furthermore, once the corporate has chosen trusted partners, it should keep an eye on them. “Monitoring the distributor’s financial wellbeing at frequent intervals is crucial to a successful DF programme,” says Demica’s Kerle.</p>
<p>Corporates also need to make sure that taking the DF route does not negatively impact them from an accounting perspective. They should ensure with an accounting expert that they will still be getting the accounting treatment they are used to post-implementation. This is not normally an issue with a well-structured DF programme.</p>
<h3 id="df-to-take-off">DF to take off?</h3>
<p>So is DF the key to allowing corporate sellers and their distributors to grow and flourish together? Will it provide a helping hand to drive development in emerging markets? Or is it destined to be a niche service provision from banks with little interest among corporates?</p>
<p>Richman believes it is already on the up, and predicts it will continue to rise. “Corporate treasuries are much more focused on working capital management than they used to be. DF, which allows corporates to more effectively manage their working capital cycle and support their trading partners, helps them address this,” he says.</p>
<p>The evolving credit landscape is also driving the growth of DF. As distributors, particularly smaller operations, find it increasingly difficult to access flexible and affordable finance (partly due to changing banking regulations), DF can extend credit to them at rates that they would not typically be able to get from their relationship bank. It is important to note that DF is supplementary to the credit companies have with their relationship bank.</p>
<p>Another growth driver will come as major manufacturing companies look to expand on an international scale, often in emerging markets. Distributors in these markets often have a much greater need for access to capital to support their own working capital cycles. This trend shows no sign of slowing down.</p>
<p>A desire among corporate sellers to build longer-lasting, sustainable links across the supply chain is contributing to the rise of DF, too. “DF, just like supplier finance, is going to continue to grow as more of the world’s leading companies adopt a very much higher prioritisation for sustainability across their supply chains: both their supply relationships as well as their dependent distributor relationships. This is a theme that we see coming through constantly from the highest quality companies, and it’s actually become something that defines the true quality of a company: the extent to which they are focusing on enabling the greatest success, both upstream into their suppliers and downstream into their distributors and sellers. They want to make their dependent constituents – suppliers and customers – more successful,” says Dunn.</p>
<p>On top of these drivers, the increasing awareness of the benefits DF can bring should entice more corporates to seek out DF solutions. This interest should in turn encourage more banks to look into devising a DF offering.</p>

<p><span>Joy Macknight (Treasury Today):</span> The global economic climate remains challenging and many banks are still facing ratings issues. How is the overall economic state-of-play impacting corporate cash management?</p>


<p><span>Neil Peacock (ABB):</span> To a certain extent the most recent developments are not having much of an impact, when put into the context of the past five years. Since 2007/8, the focus has been on ensuring that we have visibility and control – effectively centralising as much of our cash as possible to ensure it is available. Having visibility over cash in Egypt, Cyprus or Greece is one thing, but being able to use it is another.</p>
<p>In more restrictive countries in terms of moving cash in and out, such as China, India and Malaysia, we try to minimise risk by knowing where the cash is and how we can access it. These are the key drivers for cash management today – the immediate impact of recent events is not influencing us to do things differently to what we have been doing for the past three or four years.</p>


<p><span>Joy Macknight (Treasury Today):</span> Does that resonate with the other corporates in the room?</p>


<p><span>Michal Kawski (GM&amp;T):</span> Yes absolutely, I agree with that. Fundamentally nothing has changed in terms of the methodologies and tools we are using. However, recent events inside the Eurozone, or the situation in Egypt for example, are interesting signs of the times. In the Eurozone, we are centralising our euro liquidity into one place, just in case another euro crisis erupts at some point. The Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) project gave us the opportunity to further optimise our euro liquidity.</p>


<p><span>James Marshall (Virgin Media):</span> From a consumer-based corporate perspective – and a slight aside from treasury – we are keeping an eye on rising costs, which will impact customers’ ability to carry on subscribing to our products. Home connectivity and entertainment is no longer regarded as discretionary for many families, as it has proven to be of greater value compared with other activities, but nevertheless consumers’ incomes are being squeezed.</p>
<p>Virgin Media’s business is based in the UK and in sterling, but much of our capital expenditure (capex) is used to import equipment. Over the past few years we have seen more demands placed on us in terms of trade finance solutions and letters of credit (LCs), for example, which we have not had to deal with before; but this is perhaps symptomatic of a period of international fiscal uncertainty.</p>


<p><span>John Murray (Citi):</span> It is important to look at liquidity from a global standpoint, as opposed to solely from a European perspective. By concentrating funds in various currencies in a single location, clients are now challenging their banks to come up with creative solutions, particularly in trapped markets such as China and Russia. They are asking their banks how they can do more to get trapped cash out of these markets and concentrated into a single location.</p>


<p><span>Steve Everett (RBS):</span> China is at an interesting stage, as it opens up further with renminbi (RMB) internationalisation. However, it is important to remember some of the lessons from other countries in the past, particularly in terms of trapped cash, and think about what could or couldn’t happen in China if a slowdown emerges.</p>

<p><span>Filipe Simão (BNP Paribas):</span> Interestingly, the Chinese word for crisis includes both danger and opportunity – and our customers are increasingly asking for greater flexibility, a word that I will stress. It is flexibility that will ensure that the company remains agile to either postpone opportunities or take advantage of them. Importantly, flexibility is key in the way in which liquidity structures are implemented, electronic banking (e-banking) solutions are chosen and SEPA XML is leveraged.</p>


<p><span>Neil Peacock (ABB):</span> Although we have said a lot about China, we also need to consider the emerging markets, particularly in Latin America, such as Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela. We had quite high hopes for these countries, both in terms of cash generation and being able to access that cash. But we have seen some worrying signs: economic slowdown, increased controls and inflation. I think you are right, Steve, that we mustn’t forget that if things aren’t resolved in the short term to everyone’s satisfaction, things can change back the other way quite quickly. But I am quite positive about China.</p>


<p><span>Steve Everett (RBS):</span> Going back two years ago, we were constantly answering questions about the euro and what should people be doing, particularly US clients. However this has abated and we now hear minimal concerns around the Eurozone. Whilst there are lingering problems and occasionally new issues crop up, people are broadly content with what they need to do and feel that they are in control. I agree that it is very much an emerging markets issue now.</p>


<p><span>Joy Macknight (Treasury Today):</span> Are corporates finding it easier to attain the desired level of cash visibility, or is there something you need to do/have in order to get to the next level?</p>


<p><span>Neil Peacock (ABB):</span> ABB experienced a crisis in 2002, which forced it to put in place clear, accurate cash forecasting because without that it would not have had support from its banks. So for any company that is thinking about implementing a cash forecasting process, I can recommend having a crisis because there is nothing like it to focus the mind. ABB is now in the position where what was put in place ten years ago is still extremely effective today. Having good visibility and control over cash definitely helped us during the 2008 financial crisis. But it is not one of those things that you put in place and then sit back. It’s continually evolving and as markets open up, technology improves and new structures and products become available to be able to centralise cash, then we need to be ready to take advantage of those developments.</p>


<p><span>James Marshall (Virgin Media):</span> I agree with the sentiment that a crisis galvanises action to generate better cash forecasting. Due to the financial crisis, and to a certain extent our shareholders support for share buybacks, we have been able to drive down our cash balances. We can now manage cash at a much lower level as a result of better forecasting.</p>

</figure>
<p><span>Michal Kawski (GM&amp;T):</span> GM&amp;T’s formal treasury activities were set up in the summer of 2008, so you really can’t think of a better time for setting up a treasury function. This whole situation allows us to build a high profile within the organisation. But it’s not only crises that give us this opportunity. Energy or commodity trading is a volatile business today, so without good cash flow forecasting and building provisions against volatility, we wouldn’t be able to operate.</p>


<p><span>Joy Macknight (Treasury Today):</span> There has been a lot of press about corporates holding record levels of cash, yet due to Basel III short-term deposits are not so attractive for banks. Where are corporates placing their cash?</p>


<p><span>Steve Everett (RBS):</span> There are two dynamics at play here. Firstly, banks need to balance their balance sheets, only taking deposits providing we can lend them out. Currently we have excess cash and if we cannot use it, we need to review our pricing in line with the cost of holding the excess liquidity.</p>
<p>Secondly, Basel III regulations introducing liquidity coverage ratios mean certain deposit types will be fairly punitive to hold. As a result banks will face substantial costs for traditional short-term time deposits, eg those under one month. That will have a knock-on impact on our clients. We have already started thinking about our product propositions and pricing, but the unintended consequences for corporates will put a question mark over where they will be able to place this short-term cash.</p>


<p><span>John Murray (Citi):</span> I agree with you. I would add, from a banking perspective, it is important that we still support our clients and provide a safe, secure environment where they can leave their funds with a counterparty that they trust. Clients are not necessarily always chasing yield, but because the environment has improved they are starting to seek additional incremental basis points.</p>


<p><span>Filipe Simão (BNP Paribas):</span> Although Basel III gives us some leeway in reaching those famous liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) levels, many banks want to achieve the ratios ahead of schedule. Therefore, banks are very keen to accept corporate deposits because they are considered more stable than wholesale deposits. As you mentioned John, we see a growing attraction for yield, but counterparty risk is still very important. When you see market turmoil such as recently when the Portuguese stock exchange lost 5% or the events in Egypt, these remind us that risk is still important, be it sovereign or bank risk.</p>


<p><span>Michal Kawski (GM&amp;T):</span> What we learned in 2008 was that there can be counterparty risk on the banking side, which was a major change in the treasurer’s paradigm. Before that, depositing money with an institution that was rated much higher than you was a no-brainer. Since then companies began building up their own investment policy, spreading risk across different institutions and products. This is when money market funds (MMFs) took off because everyone realised that suddenly something which is AAA rated one day could be BBB rated the next, even large European financial institutions.</p>
<p>GM&amp;T now has a wider credit risk assessment policy and has diversified its portfolio across many banks and products, which is similar to other corporates. An interesting question is what will happen to the MMF industry? This will be an interesting debate over the next year or so.</p>


<p><span>Neil Peacock (ABB):</span> I would just like to add that one alternative is to invest your cash in acquisitions. Could you achieve a better return by acquiring companies and developing your business, which makes sense economically, rather than getting three basis points on a short-term deposit?</p>
<p>From our point of view, it does make sense and we have been very acquisitive. Over two years ago, we had €10 billion in cash and no yield. If you are a shareholder, is that good enough? No. Can you get a better return by acquiring companies in different markets, such as China or North America? Those are some of the decisions that need to be looked at from a strategic business standpoint.</p>


<p><span>James Marshall (Virgin Media):</span> From a governance perspective, we have an audit committee who provides oversight to many of the company’s financial operations, one responsibility of which is to look at our treasury and credit risk policies. Interestingly, their attention has been focused mainly on the products, ratings, funds, security and plans, rather than yield.</p>
<p>To your point Neil, our cash has been used to invest in the business and as a result we were not as leveraged as we could be. We have gone through a deleveraging process over the past few years with the support of our shareholders. But this was a different approach compared with pre-2008.</p>


<p><span>Joy Macknight (Treasury Today):</span> In the year of SEPA implementation, as we head towards the deadline of 1<sup>st</sup> February 2014, what challenges still remain and what is your estimation of corporate readiness?</p>


<p><span>John Murray (Citi):</span> SEPA is proving to be a challenge for corporates throughout 2013. Our main priority is to ensure that our clients have the support they need to become compliant. If you look at the rate of uptake of SEPA Credit Transfers (SCTs), as of August it is about 42%; whereas the rate of uptake of SEPA Direct Debits (SDDs) is only about 2.5%. This illustrates the readiness of the market. A particular challenge, therefore, for corporates is to be ready for SDDs. From a payments perspective, you will still be able to send wires; but the concern will be one of confidentiality should you need to make payroll payments. We are focused on ensuring that our clients are aware of the challenges, the benefits, and the risk of doing nothing – what will happen after 1<sup>st</sup> February 2014?</p>


<p><span>Neil Peacock (ABB):</span> At the beginning, treasury and shared services were the only ones involved in SEPA compliance. And then someone said ‘What about payroll? What about HR?’ There was a realisation that getting the other business units involved is quite important – what if we aren’t able to pay our employees on time?</p>

<p><span>John Murray (Citi):</span> Additionally, are your customers ready? Will you actually receive your receipts? And if you don’t, what impact will it have on your business? Payments is a network business and any network is only as good as its weakest node.</p>


<p><span>Michal Kawski (GM&amp;T):</span> When operating in a number of European countries, you realise that there are plenty of local regulations behind SDDs, which effectively means a slightly different SEPA wherever you go. SDDs may be relatively straightforward in the Netherlands, for example, but in Germany written consent is required from some counterparties, on top of technical challenges and a massive bureaucratic hurdle. We actually started our SDD project with a conference call with one of our banks just to discuss the situation country-by-country. Therefore, I can understand why SDD projects are still behind schedule. We are still not fully migrated but are on track for the deadline.</p>


<p><span>Filipe Simão (BNP Paribas):</span> We are not too concerned with SCT readiness. The migration rate is relatively high, banks are reachable and clients can easily find software solutions for converting file formats and International Bank Account Numbers (IBANs). However, on the collections side, SDD still has a very low migration rate and the migration effort required can be significant. In most countries, the SDD creditor-driven mandate flow works in the opposite way to the legacy direct debit. One piece of advice is for clients to talk to their IT vendors and banks who have in-depth migration expertise. Either way, action is to be taken now. As we get closer to the end-date, the resources available on the market will become scarce and expensive. Corporates should not assume that the deadline will be pushed back. The regulators in all European countries are committed to maintaining the end-date at 1<sup>st</sup> February 2014.</p>
<p>Clearly the focus today is regulatory, which is correct. There will be plenty of time to look at leveraging SEPA opportunities next year. This will include cross-border direct debits, payment factories and payments-on-behalf-of (POBO).</p>


<p><span>Neil Peacock (ABB):</span> Certainly we have taken a country-by-country approach because there are different levels of SEPA readiness. Finland, for example, has been 100% compliant for over a year now and we are using them as a role model, setting them up as the SEPA experts and using them as the consultants for the rest of the group. But we used SEPA not just to be compliant from a regulatory perspective, but actually to drive a pan-European cash management project.</p>


<p><span>Joy Macknight (Treasury Today):</span> Do you think that corporates will be able to carry the momentum through and leverage the benefits post-deadline?</p>


<p><span>Neil Peacock (ABB):</span> As long as treasurers start thinking about the rest of 2014 and ensuring that they have a budget available then yes they can do it. But they need to be clear as to what they want to achieve. We are trying to take advantage of the benefits that SEPA will bring in terms of bank account and bank rationalisation, as well as payment processes standardisation. Not doing that now seems like a missed opportunity and a duplication of work.</p>


<p><span>John Murray (Citi):</span> I agree that it is potentially a missed opportunity, but I think that at the moment corporates are primarily focused on being compliant and will then focus on embracing the opportunity to reduce their bank accounts to maybe one or two per country or even one across the whole of the Eurozone. Our clients are starting to consider the longer-term benefits as we talk to them about the opportunities that SEPA can bring.</p>


<p><span>Michal Kawski (GM&amp;T):</span> The SEPA topic can be split into two aspects: credits and debits. We addressed the credits side more than two years ago. From the costing perspective, generating those payments is cheaper, which is a fantastic step forward. Debits, on the other hand, are a different story but I agree that there are many areas where corporates can improve their existing cash management structures, such as centralising collections in one bank and having just one account, for example, based in London.</p>


<p><span>Neil Peacock (ABB):</span> One of the frustrations I have is the lack of harmonisation within Europe from a tax payment standpoint. So it would be great to have one central bank account, but I will still need to have a bank account in Italy, Portugal and France, for example, in order to make certain types of payments or collections.</p>


<p><span>Joy Macknight (Treasury Today):</span> What challenges remain in terms of setting up POBO and collections-on-behalf-of (COBO) structures?</p>


<p><span>Filipe Simão (BNP Paribas):</span> At BNP Paribas, we have seen corporates doing POBOs since 2003, so well before SEPA. The difference is that at the time companies were doing POBO only for cross-border payments or for payments in non-functional currencies. The way the accounting implications work are thus well known and implemented. Globally, the difficulty with POBO is to make sure that the debtor information reaches the beneficiary and that they are able to match it, otherwise the invoice will remain open. Additionally, in some countries such as Poland, it is not possible to make payments through a POBO model. It may also trigger regulatory reporting issues when used on non-resident accounts for some payments. But clearly POBO is something which has been at the heart of the in-house banking (IHB) solutions since the turn of the century; SEPA just makes it much easier.</p>

<figcaption>
<h6>James Marshall, Virgin Media</h6>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span>James Marshall (Virgin Media):</span> Because of the structure of Virgin Media, POBO is something we have always struggled with. For example, we still need to split out Virgin Mobile from Virgin Media for all employees and capex payables, but the difficulty has always been that if one shared service centre (SSC) is processing bills there is complexity in having them all paid out from the correct entity, which adds to the confusion.</p>


<p><span>John Murray (Citi):</span> I think technology will be the enabler of POBO – having one ERP system will help facilitate POBO. Having one single instance, with all entities on the same system, will make life a lot easier for the IHB in terms of managing inter-company lending.</p>


<p><span>Neil Peacock (ABB):</span> The technology is there and corporates need to understand what is available. On the back side of POBO and COBO is the virtual accounts set-up. This is where COBO really makes sense because you can have a million virtual bank accounts and allocate one to each of your customers and business units – it makes the reconciliation process a lot easier. Then you don’t necessarily need a single ERP solution, as you can split MT940s based on the virtual account set-up. And if we can do it in Europe, then why not on a global scale?</p>


<p><span>Filipe Simão (BNP Paribas):</span> Still on the technology front, corporates have started developing XML to do their mandatory technical migration to SCTs, and then discovered that they can leverage the same formats to make payments in other currencies. So XML is not just for SEPA.</p>


<p><span>Joy Macknight (Treasury Today):</span> Regulations are coming thick and fast; some have a direct impact on corporates and some indirect. How are these new regulations expected to change the treasurer’s behaviour and how can banks help their clients best prepare for what is coming down the line?</p>


<p><span>Steve Everett (RBS):</span> The ultimate knock-on impact for corporates with regards to all of the new regulation is the amount of internal change it means for the banks. A large proportion of every bank’s investment budget is now being spent on these regulatory projects, which intuitively must have a knock-on impact in terms of the discretionary value-added spend that we would normally make. As a result innovation in new services and products is either being reduced or is delivered slower than in the past. This problem is the same for all banks.</p>


<p><span>John Murray (Citi):</span> Banks spend lot of time reviewing and understanding the implications of local regulations to ensure they are aware of how these will impact their business and their clients in all the markets in which they operate. To help our clients, Citi has a knowledge of regulation not just within the Eurozone or North America, but in all the countries where we operate. This helps us to understand the local challenges. So as corporates do business around the world and seek guidance, we have people with local knowledge and experience to help them through the regulatory challenges.</p>


<p><span>Neil Peacock (ABB):</span> Corporates are a little bit like water – we always find the path of least resistance. If an obstacle is put in its way, the water finds a way round it. For example, after the financial crisis, when bank funding dried up, the bond markets became much more active. Similarly, if the Financial Transaction Tax (FTT) ever gets imposed, corporates will just deal where it is not implemented.</p>


<p><span>Filipe Simão (BNP Paribas):</span> The discussions on the FTT are still ongoing, with many banks, officials and economists voicing their concerns as to the dramatic implications if it is implemented as currently proposed by the European Commission (EC).</p>


<p><span>Michal Kawski (GM&amp;T):</span> All the regulations we’ve been talking about will impact what we do: Basel affects the funding side of our operations; FTT affects our transactions and the financial products we use; and the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) will affect the derivatives side. EMIR has been at the top of our agenda for the past 24 months at least. I know there has been a lot of debate within the treasury industry around what it actually means for corporates. Suddenly companies could be forced to make a choice: are they going to invest money in acquisitions or support the liquidity of a derivative portfolio?</p>
<p>Of course, given the latest rules recently put in place, this is probably of less relevance. However, there remain reporting requirements, which is a fairly new workload for treasurers. A number of my peers have told me that they are not sure about the formats and exactly what they are supposed to be reporting. They have to report positions from the past 18 months, so it means plenty of new challenges and much IT effort as well.</p>


<p><span>Joy Macknight (Treasury Today):</span> Many corporates are looking to alternative sources of funding. What are the corporates in the room doing?</p>


<p><span>James Marshall (Virgin Media):</span> Virgin Media had been on a deleveraging path until the Liberty Global merger and we had begun discussions around how to improving working capital with the senior executive team. This year was the first that our senior executives have working capital metrics included in their bonus calculations. The purpose of this was to enable the company to carry on its deleveraging path. The next set of discussions are focusing on supply chain finance (SCF) and other routes to reaping more working capital benefits. Liberty wholeheartedly supports this initiative and is actively pursuing this programme across Europe.</p>


<p><span>Michal Kawski (GM&amp;T):</span> In terms of alternative sources of funding, I’ve been observing the development of the retail bond market. There were a number of successful issuances in the London markets, and I also heard about a retail bond issuance in Poland a few months ago where the biggest refinery in Poland issued its bonds and they were sold out in two days – generating a few hundred million zloty. This concept seems to be attracting a new group of investors.</p>

<p><span>Filipe Simão (BNP Paribas):</span> We see a growing interest in terms of public bonds and private placements as a way for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to get mid-term financing. We are also teaming up with a treasurers association to see how we can help SMEs tap the commercial paper markets. Obviously these are instruments that are more associated with companies which are publically rated, but an increasing number of SMEs are interested.</p>


<p><span>Michal Kawski (GM&amp;T):</span> That’s interesting because the message we normally receive about the private placement market is that it is long term, for example pension funds.</p>


<p><span>Filipe Simão (BNP Paribas):</span> They tend to be long term, but we start looking at these types of products for maturities of three years.</p>


<p><span>Joy Macknight (Treasury Today):</span> Is there a tighter integration happening with cash management and trade finance, and if so, how does that help with cash forecasting?</p>


<p><span>Michal Kawski (GM&amp;T):</span> I can’t even imagine trade finance and treasury working separately in our environment. We have trade finance facilities which involve both issuing letters of credit (LCs) and a funding element, so they are tightly aligned and reporting is done together.</p>

<p><span>Steve Everett (RBS):</span> That is interesting Michal, because we have regularly put trade people in front of cash people and the general reaction is ‘that would be a nice to have’. I think it comes down to the industry you operate in. Personally I find it surprising that cash and trade are still not coming together as there has to be an opportunity around the use of liquidity, supply chain financing and forecasting across the two product sets.</p>


<p><span>Filipe Simão (BNP Paribas):</span> It depends on the industry, but also geography – cash and trade are more integrated in Asia, but more piecemeal in Europe.</p>


<p><span>Neil Peacock (ABB):</span> We have two distinct departments and actually sit on different floors, but have become closer together in the last year or so through working on shared projects such as SCF or advanced trade payable finance. We are also working together on reducing the number of bank accounts and banks, as well as centralising and standardising the issuance of guarantees. This is exactly what we are trying to do on the cash management side as well.</p>


<p><span>John Murray (Citi):</span> At Citi we are constantly seeking innovative ways to further integrate cash and trade, particularly in the purchase-to-pay space, and specifically with regards to enabling our clients to leverage their invoices and pay suppliers.</p>


<p><span>Neil Peacock (ABB):</span> Adding to John’s point, at ABB the purchase-to-pay is part of a different function, in a different building. It is part of the shared accounting services, which is part of finance and controlling. However, in some of the projects we are involved in we are working much closer with them, as well as with order-to-cash.</p>


<p><span>Michal Kawski (GM&amp;T):</span> Reducing the number of bank accounts is an interesting challenge for us at the moment. Each time we set up a trade finance facility with a bank, we need to open bank accounts for four entities. So if you multiply that by another five facilities, then the number of bank accounts increases significantly. An interesting challenge would be to work with our banks on rationalising the number of bank accounts and thinking about the structures which would allow a simplification. I know that there are difficulties in doing this, as there are many legal constraints that would block this process, but it would be an interesting challenge to take on.</p>


<p><span>Joy Macknight (Treasury Today):</span> Obviously what is happening in the market place is placing some strain on the corporate-to-bank relationship, but how are banks living up to the corporates’ expectations and what could they be doing better?</p>


<p><span>James Marshall (Virgin Media):</span> Virgin Media has been through a period of leveraging up and back down again, but in all fairness our relationships with our banks have always been very constructive. We have looked to do a lot of business with our lending banks and that has been an important part of our approach. One thing that has been interesting, certainly since 2008, is that we are now having more conversations with banks that maybe wouldn’t have been interested in offering us transaction services before, but are now very keen to have that discussion. To a certain extent, we are always happy to chat if it promotes further competition and new ideas in the marketplace.</p>


<p><span>Steve Everett (RBS):</span> But equally, providing that the core lenders can provide the services and the stability of systems, probably 95 times out of 100 corporates are sticking with the banks they know. A good two-way commitment is crucial, and it is very difficult to gain new clients if you are not in the relationship as a primary lender.</p>


<p><span>John Murray (Citi):</span> James made a very good point – since the financial crisis, a number of new banks have entered transaction services because they see the benefits of having a long-term relationship with the client and supporting them on a day-to-day basis. Maintaining the bank account provides an opportunity to offer new solutions and services to a client. If you have that account you are able to have a deeper dialogue and more knowledge of the client’s needs and subsequently identify new solutions that the client could benefit from. From a bank perspective, it is important to understand the client’s needs, to listen and to identify how the bank can help the client achieve its objectives. I think banks are getting better at that.</p>


<p><span>Joy Macknight (Treasury Today):</span> Do the corporates in the room agree with John?</p>


<p><span>Neil Peacock (ABB):</span> Yes, I actually think it is a great time to be in a corporate in transaction services because I think there are maybe ten to a dozen banks that are world class in terms of cash management. Since the crisis much more investment has been put into transaction services and there are some very good people involved. Many corporates will stay with their incumbent provider because switching would only deliver an incremental – not a dramatic – improvement in the products and service level. If you are with one of those dozen, you are going to get good service, products and support – and I think we are quite lucky in that respect.</p>
<p>We have been through some very detailed RFPs in Europe and the US in the past six months, and to a certain extent it wouldn’t have mattered which bank we chose because they would all have done a good job. It is really about choosing between the one with rainbow sprinkles and an extra cherry, or the one with chocolate and fudge. We are quite lucky, and the financial crisis actually helped that a bit because banks moved away from investment and equity trading and placed more emphasis on its transaction banking business.</p>


<p><span>Filipe Simão (BNP Paribas):</span> Do you see a difference between these ten to 12 world class cash management banks or is global transaction banking a commodity? Are there other subsets within the commodity, such as value-added services, flexibility or a long-term relationship commitment, that corporates perceive as differentiators?</p>


<p><span>Neil Peacock (ABB):</span> They aren’t all equal, just slightly different flavours. We looked at nine different categories and 37 different sub-categories, including ratings, service, structure, technology and capability. Geographic reach was also an important criteria – if we have a requirement for a bank account in Italy for collection purposes, does the bank have a full branch service in the country, or is it a rep office, or do they use a partner bank? But this is small stuff compared with the big picture.</p>


<p><span>James Marshall (Virgin Media):</span> As a consumer business, through our RFPs we evaluate the whole customer experience. From start to finish the customer experience has to be outstanding. Today our bank review meetings are not about problems, but what new technology might look like, for example mobile payments (m-payments). A number of our banks have been invited to make presentations on banking technology to help us get slightly ahead of the curve. We want to make sure that if customers want to pay us via tablets and phones for example, then we have the ability to receive their money in whatever way makes sense for them.</p>


<p><span>Neil Peacock (ABB):</span> James, you hit upon a pertinent point, which comes back to Filipe’s question as well, what is the best fit for the underlying business? If you require m-payments then you might choose the leading bank in m-payments. We make the same decisions: in the US, for example, we were offered one solution that was fantastic, but it didn’t fit the business requirements as closely as the one that wasn’t quite as good. So we went with the solution that was the best fit for our business.</p>
<p>In addition, we are looking for a long-term commitment – not just two or three years, as I don’t think we will continue to do RFPs every two or three years, but more like six or seven years. Therefore, we are also looking at the bank’s long-term ambitions and its creditworthiness as well.</p>


<p><span>Michal Kawski (GM&amp;T):</span> We have a centralised treasury function with global business operations, so it has been quite challenging to find a bank or banks that are able to support this. We wanted a bank that really understands our business – and how it is different to other businesses – and which is proactive enough to address our needs. During the RFP process we learned that some banks have a centralised approach to providing cash management services globally, whereas others are more decentralised. After the process we were absolutely convinced that the solution we decided on was a good choice and fitted well with our business.</p>


<p><span>Joy Macknight (Treasury Today):</span> And the final question, what are your predictions for hot topics in 2014?</p>


<p><span>Steve Everett (RBS):</span> The beginning of 2014 is going to be all about SEPA, whether we like it or not. The industry will be trying to cope with preparing for last minute readiness or dealing with the fallout of issues that people hadn’t fully thought through. The rest of the year will see a lot of the other regulations coming closer to live dates – Basel III, Dodd-Frank – and as a result I’m afraid there won’t be much in the way of new developments happening, as most banks and corporates remain focused on keeping their businesses on the road.</p>


<p><span>Michal Kawski (GM&amp;T):</span> I agree that regulations will dominate the agenda, unless things heat up in the political sphere. The unwinding of quantitative easing (QE) at some point might prove to be an interesting challenge for all of us, but it is more likely to be regulatory changes in 2014.</p>


<p><span>John Murray (Citi):</span> I fully agree in terms of regulations, especially SEPA. Additionally, I think that corporates should be exploring what they can do with technology and how they can leverage it to become more efficient. An example here is SAP’s Financial Services Network (FSN) and what that will enable in terms of connectivity, security and file format translation.</p>

<p><span>Neil Peacock (ABB):</span> I will be well into our euro cash concentration project by the start of 2014, so this will be taking up most of my time. We will continue to focus on regulation – we have to be compliant and take advantage of compliance and the change it brings as well. It is pretty boring really and that is a good thing – more of the same.</p>


<p><span>Filipe Simão (BNP Paribas):</span> You don’t need a crystal ball to see that the main topic until early 2014 will be SEPA. But looking a bit beyond the SEPA end-date, we see interesting developments on the retail side, such as e-wallets, mobile acquiring – which will dramatically lower the entry barriers for small merchants – and tablet usage in corporate treasuries. A few of these solutions are already out there, offered by software vendors, payment providers and banks. Inevitably some will fail and some will thrive.</p>


<p><span>James Marshall (Virgin Media):</span> When I gaze into my crystal ball, my challenge is to change from being a UK-centric cash manager into one that is part of a pan-European operation. Therefore I think it is going to be about the systems for us, to demonstrate a fit with our Liberty colleagues. This is something that we can take a lead on, as well as it being an interesting project for a treasurer to get involved with. The UK treasury team will not shoulder the burden of refinancing because this will be done by Liberty, so we can now turn our attention to supporting the business. Every time treasury assists the UK business, we add value through different payment types and modifying the business methodology.</p>


<p><span>Joy Macknight (Treasury Today):</span> Many thanks to you all for participating.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Supply chain finance (SCF) may have been available for many years, but there is no shying away from the fact that it has never quite taken the starring role in the pantheon of banking products. It may lack glamour but, for those that know, it is a simple and effective working capital solution that functions in the background helping both corporate buyers and their supply chain. Lionel Taylor, Head of Trade Products at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, gives Treasury Today a guided tour of all that SCF means today – and what it may mean in the future.</p>

<h4 class="fn">Lionel Taylor</h4>
<h5 class="title">Head of Trade Product</h5>
<img alt="Lloyds Bank" class="logo org" height="20" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/lloyds-bank-logo-2012-120x20.png" width="120"/>
<p>Lionel Taylor is Head of Trade Product at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking. He leads a team responsible for the development and delivery of the bank’s international trade products and supply chain finance proposition. Taylor has over 25 years of international trade and receivables finance experience – at senior management and director level – with major European and US financial institutions including RBS, Citi and Rabobank. He has extensive knowledge of working with companies operating in Asia and is also at the forefront of innovation in the field of supply chain finance.</p>

<p>The often unrecognised beauty of working capital solutions, also known as supply chain finance (SCF), is that it is simple and it works. There is no mystery or magic about its success – it just provides an answer for trading partners that otherwise have polarised needs, which often lead to the buyer wanting to pay their supplier as late as possible by extending their payment terms (days payable outstanding (DPO)), and the supplier wanting to reduce those terms and be paid as quickly as possible (days sales outstanding (DSO)).</p>
<p>“One political critic recently suggested that SCF may well be redundant if large companies paid their bills on time”. This opinion entirely misses the point as the payment terms and approval process dictated by the buyer may themselves be prohibitive. Also, if corporate buyers use up their excess cash by paying their suppliers earlier, they will deplete their own working capital which is essential for investment and expansion as the economy grows. In essence, a SCF programme is (mostly) a bank-led bridge spanning the needs of a buyer and its corresponding supplier chain. Despite this, a supplier only has to calculate its cost of borrowing for carrying the receivable under its own credit line on its existing terms and compare it to the cost of supplier finance initiated by its buyer to see that it will probably (but not always) be better off signing up for the latter.</p>
<p>What’s more, because most major buying organisations prefer to be seen in a positive light, in terms of business conduct, and most suppliers are keen not to upset the balance of the relationship with their buyers, both buyer and supplier need to exist in a state where all forces are equal and opposite and anything that can facilitate this state of harmony is surely welcome. Buyers are looking to introduce the SCF scheme as part of a wider corporate social responsibility (CSR) policy.</p>
<h3 id="taking-scf-further">Taking SCF further</h3>
<p>The common perception of SCF today begins with the payables finance model operating between a large corporate buyer and its many suppliers. This model enables an accelerated payment to a supplier based on the buyer’s approval of its invoices.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to understand the whole spectrum of buying and selling for a specific company, it is essential to get straight to the heart of a client’s trade relationships and the context in which that business is carried out. This demands a detailed discussion covering the precise nature of the business, where it is buying from and under what terms, what it is doing with its purchases, who it is selling to – and so the list of questions continues. It is an exhaustive, but nonetheless essential stage that enables Lloyds Bank to offer the right solution first time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Lloyds Bank, the aim is to take such an offering beyond mere talk of a specific product and steer it towards an intelligent discussion, based on genuine customer need. “We spend a lot of time across the whole of the transaction banking space talking about working capital solutions,” says Lionel Taylor, Head of Trade Products at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking. “We have a variety of products ranging from an overdraft to more specialised offerings such as trade finance, but the bank is focused on being able to find out exactly how our product set best suits the needs of our customers.”</p>
<p>This inclusive approach within Lloyds Bank transaction banking requires an intimate knowledge and understanding of the supply chain of each client. From order-to-pay, this must include the various touch points along the way, from agents to shippers to financiers, depending on the nature of the business. “It starts with trade cycle analysis,” explains Taylor. In order to understand the whole spectrum of buying and selling for a specific company it is, he notes, essential to get straight to the heart of its client’s trade relationships and the context in which that business is carried out. This demands a detailed discussion covering the precise nature of the business, where it is buying from and under what terms, what it is doing with its purchases, who it is selling to – and so the list of questions continues. It is an exhaustive, but nonetheless essential stage that enables Lloyds Bank to offer the right solution first time.</p>
<p>Indeed, whilst any discussion around SCF with a client implies an immediate or impending need, Taylor says engaging in this way generally opens up a wider discussion based around anticipated growth and expansion of that client’s business. This is exactly the reason why Lloyds Bank has adopted the inclusive approach he says, but stresses the need to be mindful that future-proofing cannot be executed at the expense of today’s need. “We find out where the pressure points are and then start to think more closely with the customer as to how we might provide the right solution. This is for the long term and we want to make sure that what we put in place does what the customer needs now and in the future.”</p>
<h3 id="aligning-the-functions">Aligning the functions</h3>
<p>There is a natural tension within the buyer organisation between the treasury’s need to extend terms and the procurement department’s desire to pay early to protect its supply chain. “But in recent years I have seen a trend evolving towards a greater degree of alignment between the divisions,” notes Taylor. The progressive move to open account trading by some trading partners may have seen some buyers wanting to push terms out ever further. But as the economic environment turned downwards, a number of companies started to think more in terms of how to protect key suppliers with programmes such as SCF spearheading the way.</p>
<p>By ensuring suppliers can take advantage of more competitive funding, secured through the buyer’s superior credit strength, it secures the supply line and potentially puts improved pricing on the buyer’s table, and also enables treasury to extend terms. “It’s good for everyone,” comments Taylor.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="putting-a-programme-in-place">Putting a programme in place</h3>
<p>Once Lloyds Bank receives a mandate from its client to put a SCF programme in place, it will begin working with that client to introduce the concept to its suppliers. “We take as much care on the supplier side as we do in bringing in a major buyer,” states Taylor. The care and attention required, particularly on the part of the supplier, can sometimes reveal SCF as a product that takes a while to be put together, erroneously making it a target for criticism.</p>
<p>“The truth is that if a programme is put in place, the buyer will be extremely sensitive as to how it works before they will consider rolling it out fully,” Taylor explains. The buyer will typically want to see a pilot project to make sure it works, and that, he concedes, does take time. Lloyds Bank consciously adopts a ‘softly, softly’ approach with suppliers because most will have established payment patterns in place. SCF will move them away from those patterns. “The supplier, rightly so, has to make its own decision about SCF in its own time and that decision must be right. It is a fallacy that they do what their buyers tell them to do – even the smaller suppliers will speak up if it is not right for them.”</p>
<h3 id="transparency-and-simplicity">Transparency and simplicity</h3>
<p>A phrase that Taylor hears from time to time in discussion with suppliers is that SCF “sounds too good to be true”. Getting funding at a competitive price and without having to give any security does seem like a fanciful proposition for any supplier but, he assures, SCF is what it claims to be. It may not suit some suppliers, particularly those that are part of a larger group who can benefit from advantageous inter-company lending rates, but generally SCF really is beneficial to all parties.</p>
<p>“Transparency is the key,” notes Taylor. Because it provides suppliers with greater visibility over buyer approvals, although many suppliers will “watch and wait for a while” before immersing themselves in SCF, it often becomes the preferred method of payment. “Suppliers also tell us that it removes some of the concentration risk they have with certain buyers.”</p>
<h3 id="programme-success">Programme success</h3>
<p>Having typically been through a request for proposal (RFP) process to secure the client mandate, all stakeholders will be keen to ensure the success of an SCF programme. From a banking perspective, Taylor says it is essential to know that every function that SCF will touch in the buyer organisation is entirely comfortable with the concept, not least because suppliers invariably call upon their contacts on the buyer side to learn about the programme independent of discussions with the bank.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main concern around international expansion is not necessarily one of technology or risk mitigation, but instead more around the management and care of suppliers. On-boarding a supplier in a country far-removed from its buyer may not be easy if that supplier is located in a country not served directly by the bank running the programme: a global bank may have a presence in that country, but it is unlikely it will have a team dedicated to SCF. Thus it becomes a matter of ensuring the level of service is of an equally high standard across the board.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once the facility is in place and Lloyds Bank has created the necessary web pages and portal for suppliers to enrol, the bank will undertake an educational programme, putting together comprehensive and bespoke information and training material for both buyer and supplier. This programme may also involve joint roadshows with the buyer, where more intensive and personalised discussions are held with suppliers. Whilst most of the work in creating a successful SCF programme must be done upfront, the good news, Taylor says, “is that once suppliers are on-board, because it is largely automated, from then on it is easy to run”.</p>
<h3 id="technology">Technology</h3>
<p>The technology required for most providers’ SCF programmes, at least at the user interface, remains purposefully simple. Each has to make information available and visible, so a supplier can see what has been approved and choose if and when it will discount those invoices, with payment being made automatically if required. But it must do so in the most intuitive way. Like most things in life, states Taylor, the simpler it is, the better. “The key with SCF is to resist the temptation to over-engineer it, making it more complicated than it needs to be.”</p>
<p>This is a challenge for a bank such as Lloyds Bank where there is a clear need to drive the service deeper into its banking infrastructure – to open up products and solutions from other banking sectors – or expand functionality beyond payables finance and, for example, enable funding against purchase orders. Because the immediate function of an SCF programme is largely about the interpretation of data, technology has a major role to play. But, insists Taylor, “whatever challenges arise at the back end, it still has to be as clean and simple for the user as possible.”</p>
<h3 id="making-the-difference">Making the difference</h3>
<p>If the SCF products offered by the banking community are all purposefully uncomplicated and somewhat similar in approach, at least at the front end, how does Lloyds Bank mark itself out from the crowd?</p>
<p>“The truth is that differentiation is all about the execution and whether the client is confident that its bank can provide the right level of service and due care and attention for both buyer and supplier,” notes Taylor. With a strong reputation in terms of its relationship with customers of all segments, he adds, “this is where Lloyds Bank achieves and succeeds very highly” and where the focus is on “people meeting people” and “real conversations”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once the facility is in place and Lloyds Bank has created the necessary web pages and portal for suppliers to enrol, the bank will undertake an educational programme, putting together comprehensive and bespoke information and training material for both buyer and supplier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means following-up on every promise, ensuring progress is being made and that if an issue is raised, it is tackled quickly and effectively. This applies equally to buyer and supplier but, for suppliers, there will perhaps be special provision: “As simple as the concept may sound to some, there may be a supplier who has no knowledge of it whatsoever. We have to respect that and take them through each step.”</p>
<h3 id="what-lies-ahead">What lies ahead</h3>
<p>The challenge for banks in advancing their SCF programmes lies in how they will expand their international capabilities, Taylor notes. One up and coming enabler for an SCF programme in this context is SWIFT’s Bank Payment Obligation (BPO) tool. Where a Lloyds client (as a buyer organisation) is working with a trading partner in another country, trade will require a level of guarantee between the two banks; if the overseas bank is making a payment to a supplier under the SCF scheme, it will of course seek a recovery from Lloyds Bank if there is an issue. In this respect, he feels that the BPO mechanism would mitigate that risk, acknowledging the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC)-approved solution as “an aid going forward”.</p>
<p>However, Taylor feels the main concern around international expansion is not necessarily one of technology or risk mitigation, but instead more around the management and care of suppliers. On-boarding a supplier in a country far-removed from its buyer may not be easy if that supplier is located in a country not served directly by the bank running the programme: a global bank may have a presence in that country, but it is unlikely it will have a team dedicated to SCF. Thus it becomes a matter of ensuring the level of service is of an equally high standard across the board, says Taylor.</p>
<p>“At Lloyds Bank, because our service in the UK is run so well, it is natural for buyers to ask if we can look at expanding it to other areas. We can do this – on a very careful, step-by-step basis – by collaborating with other best-in-class banks in the relevant region,” he explains. “But whatever we put in place, it has to be at least as strong as it is in our client’s home market.”</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>The age-old problem of buyers wanting to pay as late as possible and suppliers wanting the cash immediately seems an intractable one at best. Of course, corporate buyers could pay their suppliers in good time, but different markets have different attitudes to this issue. D&amp;B reported a set of figures from its annual review of Asian, European and North American payment practices last year which showed that in 2011 Taiwan led the pack on due-date settlement with 69.3%. Hong Kong had a 34.5% punctuality record and China 33.1%. The European average was 37.8% with Germany way ahead on 74.7%, while Switzerland followed with 55.3% and the UK lagged way behind at 26.3%. Only Portugal was slower to pay, with a punctual payment figure of just 21.8%. The US displayed an average 51% punctuality record, while Canada’s average due-date payment was 44.9% and Mexico was 59.9%.</p>
<p>Lelaina Lim, CFO of RSH Limited, told Treasury Today that when she first started in her role as the Shanghai-based Regional Financial Controller of International SOS (a medical evacuation company) she was faced with a receivables turnover of 350 days. She brought this down to 120 days over a two-year period but said even this was not easy. “It was hard and people thought I was very harsh, but after two years people realised that it was a do-or-die situation. A business that doesn’t collect cash can’t survive.”</p>
<p>In Europe, the EC issued Directive 2011/7/EU to try to encourage a fairer play between both parties. The directive came into force on 16<sup>th</sup> March 2013 as a means of combating late payment in commercial transactions. However, the Directive does not harmonise payment periods across the region, but instead creates a statutory right to interest 30 days after the date of the invoice, unless of course another payment period has been negotiated in the contract.</p>
<h3 id="a-place-for-scf">A place for SCF</h3>
<p>This is where supply chain finance (SCF) has a role to play in easing the tension. SCF has been playing an increasingly significant role in the trade finance portfolios of some banks, with major global institutions claiming an average annual growth rate of up to 40%. According to the annual industry survey of global banks and corporates by working capital solutions, advisory and technology provider, Demica, this sustained uptake will continue to the end of the decade.</p>
<p>Growth in SCF programmes indicated by those surveyed is highest in the US and Western Europe, particularly in the UK (with its low payment punctuality record) and Germany (with quite the opposite), with Eastern Europe, India and China (the worst of D&amp;B’s payment punctuality Asian countries) noted as leading regions with the greatest SCF market potential. Some 90% of bank respondents see SCF as a “must-have” financial product for corporate buyers and more than 75% of them see it as an “added-value” product. Respondents believe that domestic SCF programmes will lead the expansion and that the level of competition between banks will soon commoditise the offering. The adoption of cross-border SCF programmes will continue to gather pace but the greater complexity involved will enable it to retain its ‘value-added’ status.</p>
<h3 id="asian-trade">Asian trade</h3>
<p>Sanjay Dalmia, EVP Global Cash Management and CEO of Fundtech India, notes “a pick-up” of interest in SCF, particularly in the Asian markets. “But challenges remain,” he adds. From the banking perspective there is a degree of separation from the actual beneficiaries of the solution. As banks work with the CFOs, it can be difficult to steer procurement managers and suppliers towards a common platform and to get them to understand the benefits of such a programme. The parties often cite perceived issues and complexities around supplier on-boarding and technical integration of systems and workflows as a reason for not doing it.</p>
<p>Although he agrees there may be workflow issues within certain corporates, Dalmia says this is not solely an IT issue, but also one of poor communication caused by operational silos. These silos underpin a misalignment of purpose internally between accounts payable (AP), procurement and treasury, and where respectively each is intent on holding on to cash, keeping suppliers happy and keeping on top of cash management.</p>
<p>The purpose of supplier finance in its various forms is to bridge the payment gap between a supplier’s delivery of goods and the final settlement of its invoice by the buyer. The latter typically initiates a programme via its own bank (and so it does not impact the buyer’s own balance sheet), using its own strong credit rating to secure better rates than its suppliers can on their own. The corporate may even self-fund the programme “if it is flush with liquidity”, notes Dalmia, adding that this obviously has balance sheet implications and that any charges must be set “at arms length”.</p>
<p>In terms of technology, Dalmia comments that “the tools are improving all the time, but the model of operation broadly remains the same.” David Gustin, President of Global Business Intelligence, a Canada-based international trade research and advisory firm, has been following the industry closely for many years and notes that there are a lot of misconceptions about what the various forms of supplier finance are and how they work. As part of his research Gustin is currently finalising a ‘vendor positioning grid’ that looks at a multitude of vendors that market various working capital technology solutions to try to understand the lay of the land.</p>
<p>“Certainly in an effort to leverage the wider adoption of supply chain automation tools, or in believing specific under-served opportunities exist, many vendors have been adding working capital capabilities to their product suite,” he notes. These solutions may not fit all purposes and Gustin notes too that large-scale buyers – multinationals – that have developed approved programmes have tackled the matter in a way that complements their own industry peculiarities and as such “they are all very different and have met with varying degrees of success”.</p>
<p>The typical view of the supply chain, from the finance perspective, considers the funding of suppliers. This will mostly take the form of post-shipment finance but increasingly in Asia the requirement is for pre-shipment finance, says Ashutosh Kumar, Global Head of Corporate Cash and Trade at Standard Chartered. The beneficiary of post-shipment finance is the direct supplier. Pre-shipment finance will push the finance “much deeper into the supply chain”, to the point of funding the upstream suppliers that supply raw materials to direct supplier, he explains.</p>
<p>These upstream suppliers tend to be in the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector and often do not have a sufficiently strong balance sheet to secure lower-cost bank funding, or may even find that funding in their domestic market is not readily available. The arrangement of pre-shipment finance moves away from a predominantly balance sheet-based discussion towards a supply chain risk analysis, executed by the bank (because it is the one taking the financial risk) in tandem with its corporate client. This, explains Kumar, must consider many points of the relationship between buyer and supplier to determine acceptability, pricing and so on. Assessment includes factors such as the unresolved rejection rate of the goods supplied, the nature and marketability of the products being bought and the dynamics of the market itself.</p>
<h3 id="the-other-half-of-the-story">The other half of the story</h3>
<p>But SCF is “only half of the story” in the Asian markets, says Kumar. Corporate clients of the bank are now asking for extended programmes to cover funding of their distributors too. “Of late we have seen a much greater demand for distributor finance; currently every company is looking to sell more and this is a way of helping distributors to achieve more sales without having to worry about finance.”</p>
<p>Indeed, in China, Benjamin Lam, China Trade Head, Managing Director, J.P. Morgan, noted in a recent Treasury Today Question Answered article that as domestic companies increasingly trade cross-border and international firms continue to invest in China, demand is rising for properly integrated SCF solutions that can link upstream and downstream procurement, buyers, vendors and distributors.</p>
<p>Distributor finance mirrors supplier finance in that the large corporate buyer becomes the supplier, using its credit status to finance the distributor’s purchase of goods. It is prevalent in markets such as India, China and Korea and, notes Kumar, it is evolving in quite a few other regional markets, but in all cases cuts across a broad spectrum of industries.</p>
<p>There is a difference between the procurement and sales side in how risk management is handled. As a corporate moves into an Asian emerging market trading on open account terms (because letters of credit (LCs) may prove too administratively restrictive or expensive), a detailed supply chain risk analysis is essential. But this almost takes the reverse view of a pre-shipment finance risk assessment, considering factors such as the marketability of the corporate’s own products, its position in the market, the relative strength of that market and the financial dependencies between the corporate as supplier and its distributors.</p>

<h2 id="case-study-1">Case study</h2>
<h3 id="ab-electrolux-and-deutsche-bank-on-boarding-suppliers">AB Electrolux and Deutsche Bank –<br/>on-boarding suppliers</h3>
<p>AB Electrolux is a global household name. It manufactures white goods for distribution in more than 150 markets, generating revenues in 2012 of $16.9 billion. In June 2011 the company asked Deutsche Bank to help set up a SCF programme for its North American business. Amongst the main aims of the project, AB Electrolux wanted to improve supplier liquidity (funded by the bank) to reduce “often costly” supply chain disturbances, said James Krikorian, North American Treasury Manager, AB Electrolux. Speaking at the recent EuroFinance Miami conference, he said the company also had a keen eye on freeing up its own working capital by extending days payable outstanding (DPO) (using the cash instead for core business growth), moving towards a standardised electronic invoicing (e-invoicing) process and harmonising payment terms for its suppliers.</p>
<p>In total, AB Electrolux uses 300 suppliers with which it has an annual spend of around $2.7 billion. The majority (225 businesses with a spend of $1.115 billion) are based in Europe, with seven in Asia (spending $400m), 60 in South America ($750m) and 20 in North America ($400m annual spend). AB Electrolux’s more than 50 buyers are located in 25 countries, with US and Australian dollar, euro, Thai baht and Chinese renminbi as the main currencies. This structure is not set in stone and given the changing economics of global manufacturing AB Electrolux has some major plans involving some 450 targeted Asian suppliers located in eight countries in the region. The flexibility and scalability of its SCF programme will be tested, but the preparation work has ensured it has a solid base to work from.</p>
<p>The original project was managed by a cross-functional team within AB Electrolux covering procurement, legal, AP, IT and treasury, and followed discussions with other companies that had already implemented similar programmes. Krikorian advised anyone considering this path to start by gaining top management buy-in and to use key performance indicators (KPIs) throughout to “keep focus on the SCF programme and ultimately to reach those targets”.</p>
<p>In practical terms, the first step for Krikorian’s team was to build a comprehensive picture of flows with a view of seller and buyer locations and currencies. From here it was possible to build a business case and evaluate the inherent risks, which might include counterparty risk (whether that is the chosen bank partner or platform provider). Therefore, a set of what-if scenarios were prepared so that should the worst happen and the programme had to be wholly or partly terminated the results could be understood. The regulatory environment for each jurisdiction and the accounting treatment of the programme was also considered as part of the foundation project.</p>
<p>In assessing its banking partner – naturally the chosen one had to match the existing supplier and buyer locations of AB Electrolux, have the credit capacity to handle the full programme (using a syndicated structure where necessary) and not present any IT integration issues – both credit capacity and IT integrity were considered “pass or fail” criteria. However, AB Electrolux was seeking not only financial, technical and IT expertise for operations and support (including the ability to provide data extracts of AP) but also the ability of the bank to on-board and follow up on suppliers in additional countries and in local languages, especially as the Asian expansion programme was on the horizon.</p>
<p>Having established the partnership with Deutsche Bank, AB Electrolux was able to form a rigorous on-boarding strategy using the experience of the bank to support its decisions. Krikorian also reported that one key contact was appointed from procurement for the SCF programme and other members of the department were trained to assess and understand the effects of the programme on the suppliers, each considered for their criticality to the manufacturing process, their current payment terms, level of business and spend and current credit rating. In building out the approach for its supplier base, AB Electrolux established a number of on-boarding models, using one-to-one meetings, seminars, webinars and mailing of details regarding the mandatory change of current terms. Suppliers were then divided into one of three tiers (as Krikorian noted, “one size does not fit all”) and some “low-hanging fruit” were identified as potential “quick and easy wins”.</p>
<p>By defining a timeline for supplier negotiations and establishing the level of internal resources needed it was possible to allocate with precision “who does what and when” and to set expectations. To test its processes, AB Electrolux set up a small number of “well connected” suppliers as pilot cases to try “two or three of the preferred on-boarding strategies” and to test its file and payment transfers before evaluating and adjusting prior to full roll-out.</p>

<h3 id="the-role-of-swifts-bpo">The role of SWIFT’s BPO</h3>
<p>Where a corporate exhibits a level of discomfort with the counterparty risk of its buyers, credit insurance would be appropriate but, says Standard Chartered’s Kumar, this is not readily available in some Asian markets. This drives companies to use LCs as a risk mitigation tool but, he notes, these can be inefficient from an administrative perspective, often adding up to ten days in processing time.</p>
<p>This is where the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC)-approved SWIFT Bank Payment Obligation (BPO) (which became effective in July of this year) could play a major role by helping firms working in and out of the region to mitigate the counterparty risk arising from open account trading. Standard Chartered has already carried out transactions – with BP Chemicals and its client Octal – using this tool (<a href="/2013/05/a-credit-to-the-industry-david-vermylen-bp">see Treasury Today’s May 2013 Corporate View with BP Petrochemicals’ David Vermylen</a>).</p>
<p>SWIFT promises that the BPO will give easier access to risk mitigation around pre and post-shipment finance. It allows sellers to electronically send trade documentation to their buyers and exchange the documentation data with both obligor and recipient banks. This enables them to get involved earlier facilitating payment as soon as the buyer raises the purchase order (PO), not delaying until the invoice has been approved as is the case with LCs. The four-party approach also means suppliers can use their own local bank rather than the buyers’ banks (as would be the case in the traditional SCF programme), removing Know Your Customer (KYC) from the process and potentially lowering on-boarding costs.</p>
<p>“Asia is the centre of global trade growth and as the supply chain space evolves, more corporates will be looking towards open account and supply chain solutions,” says Vinod Madhavan, Standard Chartered’s Global Head, Local Corporate Products and Receivables and SCF. “Our expectation is that many corporates will now start using BPO to free up their working capital.”</p>
<p>Whilst treasurers know that freeing up working capital is beneficial, an increasing number of large corporates are aware that doing it by extending days sales outstanding (DSO) too far can harm their suppliers – as such SCF is gaining traction. The two case studies illustrate different ways in which it can be approached.</p>

<h2 id="case-study-2">Case study</h2>
<h3 id="stanley-black-and-decker-and-citi-a-centralised-working-capital-tool">Stanley Black &amp; Decker and Citi –<br/>a centralised working capital tool</h3>
<p>Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SBD), a global supplier of tools, hardware, appliances and security systems for industrial and consumer use, has an inclusive approach to improving its working capital management including supplier finance. Yannick Croiger, Director of Financial Risk Management and Corporate Finance, explains that since 2007 the company’s primary focus has been the implementation of the group-wide Stanley Fulfilment System (SFS), covering the central management of inventory, accounts payable (AP) and receivable (AR). The system is based on a number of common platforms including SAP, Hyperion, Navision, JDA, Red Prairie, Demand Solution, Share Point Server, Business Objects and Citi’s Supplier Finance platform.</p>
<p>The problem with working capital, Croiger notes, is that it is cash that is locked up in operating the company from day-to-day and as such it is preferable to have as little as possible in this state; it is money that could be used for more accretive purposes. Decreasing inventory, collecting payables sooner and working out how to pay suppliers later without damaging them is the goal. “The concept is extremely easy to understand. Implementation on the other hand requires effort and discipline.”</p>
<p>What SBD is creating (it has been an ongoing project since 2007) is a methodical, process-based approach to supplier finance and working capital that provides a “user friendly, automated and error-proof customer experience, from intent-to-purchase to shipping and billing to payment”. From a group perspective it has become a “critical business process that keeps supply and demand in balance”.</p>
<p>Kicking off a project of this nature will require senior management buy-in and it is also essential to communicate a policy on minimum terms and to enforce this policy right from the start. The centralisation of the project team at corporate level helped SBD leverage the knowledge and experience of cross-functional teams drawn from treasury, global sales and marketing, IT and accounting departments.</p>
<p>In practice, SBD’s suppliers follow existing protocol for submitting and processing invoices but, for those within the scheme, twice a week SBD will upload payment files (which include invoice-level details based on established terms between SBD and the relevant suppliers) to Citi’s web-based Supplier Finance platform. Suppliers are then notified of the due payment of their approved invoices via email. They may then log into the system and elect to discount some, all or none of these. Having done so they will typically receive funds (less the discount) on the next working day, with SBD paying Citi in full on the invoice due date, according to the agreed terms.</p>
<p>Entities (and thus their suppliers) within SBD that wish to join the scheme are prioritised around considerations of jurisdiction, currency and internal credit capacity as well as practical matters such as connectivity with the ERP. Croiger says it now takes between three to six months to admit a new company member. This allows the team to assess the most suitable supplier candidates, the preparation of legal documentation, any IT work and of course for the procurement team to introduce the Citi Supplier Finance concept to their suppliers.</p>
<p>For SBD, its efforts and actions have resulted in outperformance of its industry peers in terms of working capital reduction despite continued growth through acquisition. Croiger feels that the process may have initially “caused headwinds” but ultimately it has provided opportunities; SBD has seen a working capital reduction in the last 12 years of over $450m. However, he is adamant that the kind of discounting alternative the company has used “should be used to supplement good operating procedures, not to mask poor or lagging performance”. Indeed, Croiger warns anyone considering this model to first establish rigorous operating processes, especially as it requires the business to strive for automation and the leverage of common platforms where possible. As well as ensuring the structure is as scalable as possible, he advises companies to invest time and money automating as much as possible up front, “even if the implementation takes longer”.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Adding value along the supply chain]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Financing the supply chain has become a popular topic in the treasury world, but many people may be surprised to learn that the origins of supply chain finance can be traced back to solutions developed nearly 20 years ago by Spanish banks. These solutions are now attracting more widespread interest in response to the challenges faced by trading partners worldwide. We look at the ways in which such solutions can be employed to add value along the supply chain.</p>
<h3 id="drivers-for-financing-solutions">Drivers for financing solutions</h3>
<p>The recent interest in financing solutions has arisen due to a number of factors. Two of the most important are outsourcing and the growth of open account trading.</p>
<h4 id="outsourcing">Outsourcing</h4>
<p>Corporates are increasingly outsourcing production, often to other countries, in order to take advantage of lower manufacturing costs. As supply chains are extending across the globe, large corporates are realising that they need to be more collaborative and distance themselves from the traditional tug-of-war that usually takes place between buyer and supplier.</p>
<p>In order to maximise working capital, it may seem to be in the buyer’s best interest to increase their Days Payables Outstanding (DPO) by extending credit terms with suppliers. However, the pressure that this approach places on the supplier means that there are often repercussions for the buyer in the form of higher prices. This has recently given way to a more collaborative approach. Co-operative supply chain management is fast becoming considered best practice and supply chain finance is one of the solutions that have been adopted as a result.</p>
<h4 id="open-account-trading">Open account trading</h4>
<p>Although letters of credit (LCs) show no signs of becoming extinct just yet, their relative market share of global trade is decreasing and 80% of global trade is now conducted on open account. Open account trading has its advantages. Letters of credit are generally regarded as time consuming, paper intensive and prone to delays as the documents on which payment is contingent are often rejected when first presented by the exporter. Open account, meanwhile, is less complex, as suppliers simply submit an invoice and receive payment in due course. From the buyer’s point of view this arrangement is ideal.</p>
<p>Despite the overall growth of open account, LCs are still important in certain countries and in particular circumstances. LCs are widely used in Asia, for example, where they are particularly valued as a source of integrated pre- and post-shipment finance. Open account is more open to abuses such as late payment and is therefore more suitable for adoption in well-established business relationships. LCs still have a significant role to play in new trade relationships when the counterparties do not know each other very well. In such cases, a bank guarantee can give counterparties added comfort when trading with each other. Similarly, LCs are often used in support of high value transactions and specialised industries, such as oil trading.</p>
<p>The switch to open account trading, on the other hand, can put suppliers at a disadvantage. For them this is a riskier method than LCs because they have to ship goods without receiving any guarantee of payment. This is of particular concern in today’s global environment, where suppliers may be funding the shipping of goods to the other side of the world without knowing for certain if they will be paid. The onus is on the suppliers to find additional forms of financing while they wait for payment, without the comfort of a LC from the importer’s bank.</p>
<h3 id="receivables-financing">Receivables financing</h3>
<p>Various traditional forms of receivables financing solution exist, including factoring and invoice discounting. In this type of arrangement a financier advances a percentage of the funds due to the supplier before the customer has actually paid.</p>
<p>In a factoring solution, for example, the financier (factor) will advance the supplier up to 80% of the face value of the invoice. The factor will then chase payment from the buyer. Once the buyer has made payment, the factor will then pay the supplier the remaining percentage of the invoice’s value, minus a fee or discount.</p>
<p>One of the problems with this type of solution is that banks do not know whether or not the buyer has approved the invoice when they advance funds. More recently, there has been a surge of interest in the area of supplier financing, which is structured to take the buyer’s creditworthiness into account, rather than just the supplier’s.</p>
<h3 id="supplier-finance">Supplier finance</h3>
<p>Supplier finance, or supply chain finance (SCF), works in a similar way to factoring, hence its alternative name of reverse factoring. In this type of arrangement, the financer gives the supplier 100% of the due payment upfront, minus discounting charges. Unlike other receivables financing arrangements, which are generally initiated by the supplier, a supplier financing arrangement is initiated by the buyer through the buyer’s own bank.</p>
<h4 id="spanish-origins">Spanish origins</h4>
<p>Spain has a history of developing financial instruments for the improvement of working capital management: bills of exchange were already used as a type of commercial credit back in the 15<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> centuries, and more recently Spanish banks were ahead of their time in realising the importance of the invoice in financing solutions. If the buyer approves an invoice then a bank is better able to mitigate risk and offer reduced financing costs. The crucial role of the invoice is at the heart of many of the financial supply chain products that are available today, including supplier finance.</p>
<p>Supplier finance originated nearly 20 years ago in Spain, for similar reasons to those that have brought it to the forefront of treasury management today. The conflict between the needs of buyers and the needs of suppliers was heightened by Spain’s traditionally long credit terms. This encouraged the development of a new solution that provided suppliers with additional finance without antagonising buyers.</p>
<p>The development of supplier finance was also stimulated by the local practice of charging stamp duty on bills of exchange which were widely used for raising working capital finance. Santander was the first bank to develop a reverse factoring solution in Spain, called Confirming<sup>®</sup> (see interview box).</p>
<h4 id="the-process">The process</h4>
<p>Supplier finance provides suppliers with reliable finance at a lower cost than other solutions. This is achieved by using the buyer’s stronger credit rating or access to better credit conditions, which allow the buyer’s bank to offer finance on more favourable terms than the supplier can normally achieve. A corporate´s balance sheet size, bank relationships and country risk premium can vary widely from those of its suppliers, especially when trading partners are located in different countries. In this way, corporates can negotiate or ‘arbitrage’ trade terms according to the relative value they attribute to reducing working capital compared to other factors such as cost of goods, as well as local financing costs versus proposed supply chain finance costs.</p>
<p>In some scenarios, buyers can benefit from both longer payment terms and a lower cost of goods, due to the reduced pressure on the supplier. The involvement of the bank as an active third party in the transaction creates a win-win situation and a happy compromise between the needs of the buyer and those of the supplier.</p>
<h4 id="benefits-for-suppliers">Benefits for suppliers</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Opportunity for early settlement of invoices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suppliers receive a higher percentage of invoice face value upfront than under traditional arrangements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Funding is non recourse and off-balance sheet, and can consequently reduce existing bank debt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the supplier and the buyer have differing access to credit or have different financial objectives, the cost will often be lower than the cost of conventional financing methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Visibility and information throughout the transaction.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="benefits-for-buyers">Benefits for buyers</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reduced cost of processing supplier payments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved visibility of outgoing cash flow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fewer queries regarding the status of invoices as suppliers can check this on the bank’s multi-language portal or contact centre.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opportunity for improved (ie longer) terms with suppliers, hence improving their working capital position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opportunity to negotiate lower cost of goods from suppliers, due to improved financing terms achieved.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="liquidity-management">Liquidity management</h3>
<p>Financing solutions are not the only way to add value to the supply chain. Efficient movement of money, maximisation of interest and minimisation of costs are key elements to any supply chain management solution.</p>
<p>Cash pooling is an effective way to manage liquidity, particularly within large companies operating in many different countries. By setting up a cash pool, either domestically or cross-border, a company is able to retain central control of the group’s liquidity while maximising the interest gained on individual account balances.</p>
<p>Notional pooling, in which funds are not physically moved but rather considered together for interest optimisation purposes, allows subsidiaries to maintain their own independence and has the benefit of not creating inter-company loans. Pooling through zero balancing, on the other hand, physically concentrates funds into a single master account.</p>

<figure class="portrait left"><img alt="Portrait of Carlos Rodriguez de Robles" class="photo" height="150" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/2008/04/2008-04-tt-05-bb-carlos-rodriguez-de-robles-100x150.jpg" width="100"/></figure>

<img alt="Santander Global Banking &amp; Markets" class="logo org" height="38" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/santander-global-banking-and-markets-logo-130x38.png" width="130"/>

<h5 id="why-did-santander-develop-the-confirming-solution">Why did Santander develop the Confirming<sup>®</sup> solution?</h5>
<p>Confirming<sup>®</sup> was first developed nearly 20 years ago as a cost effective alternative to discounting commercial bills of exchange on which stamp duty was payable. The solution has evolved into a highly successful web-based payment and financing solution, which enables creditworthy corporates to optimise working capital through Days Payable Outstanding. At the same time, it permits suppliers to accelerate cash flow and reduce Days Sales Outstanding by discounting confirmed receivables on a non recourse basis.</p>
<h5 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Buyers use Confirming<sup>®</sup> to outsource to Santander their supplier payments, both domestically and internationally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buyers upload files of approved or ‘confirmed’ invoices to Santander.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Santander advises suppliers that payment is due to be made to them at invoice maturity and offers to discount these payments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suppliers accepting this non-recourse early payment complete a receivables assignment short form contract and receive discounted payments into nominated accounts with any bank.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At invoice maturity buyers settle with Santander.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buyers and suppliers can access Santander’s platform and download extensive reporting and reconciliation information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="how-is-it-different-to-other-supply-chain-financing-solutions">How is it different to other supply chain financing solutions?</h5>
<p>The main difference between Confirming<sup>®</sup> and other types of payer-backed reverse factoring programmes is that Confirming<sup>®</sup> has already been adopted on a large scale in our core markets – Spain, Portugal and Latin America – with hundreds of thousands of buyers and suppliers using Confirming<sup>®</sup> via the web and with tens of billions of euros of invoices being settled in this way each year. Over the years, our Confirming<sup>®</sup> platform has undergone a series of enhancements ensuring a flexible range of capabilities in terms of financing, reporting and reconciliation, which we believe give us an edge over more recent solutions in the market.</p>
<p>With our international track record, Confirming<sup>®</sup> is now being extended into other geographies, with the required expertise to add value to our customers’ supply chain management. Significant effort has been invested in understanding legal and accounting issues, such as the importance of perfecting receivables assignment under local laws of the supplier, which in turn helps buyers to avoid needing to reclassify trade payables on their balance sheet as bank debt, which would otherwise impact negatively on debt gearing.</p>
<h5 id="what-future-developments-do-you-think-we-will-see-in-the-area-of-supply-chain-finance">What future developments do you think we will see in the area of supply chain finance?</h5>
<p>Supply chain finance based on discounting approved invoices would benefit from faster approval of invoices, since this enables a bank to make earlier discounted payment to suppliers. Hence innovative banks are integrating e-invoicing solutions into their supply chain product range in order to deliver greater working capital benefits. We also see significant value in delivering solutions to streamline corporate processes earlier in the supply chain trade cycle, for example by helping our customers to distribute purchase orders efficiently and providing matching services against invoices.</p>
<p>This approach not only reduces costs and raises efficiency, but also creates opportunities for pre-shipment finance as well as post-shipment finance, with significant working capital benefits. These solutions of course involve integrating more closely with our corporate clients’ ERP systems, enhancing information flows between ourselves and our clients and delivering improved straight through processing (STP).</p>
<p>Banks are also streamlining their documentary trade finance solutions through use of the web and scanning so that it is easier and more cost effective for their clients to manage their letters of credit, bonds and guarantees and collections, which remain valuable instruments in certain scenarios, geographies and early stages in a business relationship. We believe this holistic approach to trade and supply chain will continue to be of value to our clients, combining open account and documentary trade finance solutions.</p>

<h4 id="electronic-banking">Electronic banking</h4>
<p>Most international banks offer electronic banking platforms that allow companies to move cash efficiently between entities. These platforms facilitate the processing of high volumes of transactions, coverage of a wide range of locations, automated procedures, such as payment and collection reconciliation, and connectivity to a company’s ERP system. Banking networks such as SWIFT, meanwhile, now allow corporates to use one platform to connect to a range of banks.</p>
<p>In emerging markets, where local requirements vary from one country to another, it is important to work with banks who have a strong local presence, with the necessary in-country expertise and reach to provide regional cash and liquidity management solutions.</p>
<h3 id="industry-initiatives">Industry initiatives</h3>
<p>The growing focus on SCF and supply chain optimisation has led to a number of interesting initiatives. SWIFT’s Trade Services Utility (TSU) is a bank-to-bank solution which matches data in certain types of trade document. Corporates effectively outsource the matching of documents such as purchase orders and commercial invoices to the banks involved in the TSU.</p>
<p>TSU Release II, due towards the end of 2008, is expected to include a Bank Payment Obligation instrument. This will be a guarantee to pay a bank a certain amount on a specified future date, providing a particular condition is met – such as a match of certain data presented through the TSU. The automation of this bank guarantee model will allow banks to develop new variations on current financing solutions.</p>
<p>A range of other solutions have been set up to streamline the flow of trade data for corporates and banks. Bolero, one such initiative, developed a multi-bank platform that enables large corporates to issue import LCs and be notified of export LCs in a highly automated and paperless way. The platform can be directly linked to corporates’ ERP systems and to banks’ back-end trade finance processing capabilities, improving straight through processing for all participants. However, such solutions still need to reach critical mass in order to provide an effective solution, and so far no single multi-bank platform has emerged as an overall winner in this area.</p>
<h3 id="the-future-of-supply-chain-finance">The future of supply chain finance</h3>
<p>Over the last few years, the European Commission has begun promoting e-invoicing as a valuable means of reducing processing costs. The Euro Banking Association (EBA) is also investigating the possibility of offering e-invoicing services as a logical extension to their payments and collection work regarding the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA).</p>
<p>Although these are medium- to long-term initiatives, banks are already collaborating on e-invoicing developments. In addition to cutting processing costs, e-invoicing has the potential to ensure that greater volumes of invoices are processed in a shorter space of time, accelerating cash flows for suppliers. A central role for banks in e-invoicing would be consistent with their current positioning in payment and collection processing. There are numerous initiatives to enhance processes in the corporate to bank space in terms of cash management, trade and supply chain solutions, such as TWIST, Bolero and TSU. There is still some uncertainty over which of these will prove most successful, but one would anticipate that those industry-wide initiatives with backing from banks and corporates will eventually prevail.</p>
<p>Supplier finance has been around for longer than most people realise but is now widely recognised as an effective solution for buyers and suppliers. It has spread from Spain into Portugal and Latin America and is now increasingly becoming available in other regions, supported by technological advances in the treasury field. As payment and invoice processes become increasingly automated, it is likely that the evolution of supplier finance will continue to embrace change and refine supply chain finance and working capital management even further.</p>
