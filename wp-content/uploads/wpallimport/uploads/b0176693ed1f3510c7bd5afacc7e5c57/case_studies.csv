<p style=""clear:both;"">No company can last over 100 years, as fibre cement maker James Hardie has, without being innovative and flexible through the ages, not least in how it goes about meeting its funding needs.</p>
<p>The financial crisis of 2007-2008 certainly demanded a response on that front at the Australia-listed group and James Hardie International Finance (JHIF) Designated Activity Company, the treasury subsidiary tasked with handling all of the group’s treasury related activities played a key role.</p>
<p>For Kevin Daly, Assistant Treasurer of the five-strong Dublin-based treasury team, the funding challenge posed by the crisis for the group, which employs 4,800 globally and generated sales of US$2.1bn in fiscal 2018, was clear: “We were on a growth path before the crisis. Being so exposed to the building industry meant we were very vulnerable to the eventual fallout, especially in the US which accounts for a majority of our business. But we were confident things would turn eventually and that investment would be needed going forward.”</p>
<p>At the same time, treasury understood that, in the dramatically changed post-crisis environment, it had to evolve its banking and funding structure. “We knew, for instance, that we would need high capex spend coming out of the crisis and larger facilities over a number of years so we began to look into debt capital markets as well. Diversification became a key objective.”</p>
<h3 id=""making-the-change"">Making the change</h3>
<p>In 2014 JHIF decided to evolve from bi-lateral USD facilities to a USD syndicated facility and also get a credit rating so that it would be able to access the bond markets. It engaged with the main agencies to secure ratings, allow time to build up relationships and knowledge with the agencies and ultimately to enable it to access the debt markets.</p>
<p>But actioning that strategy wasn’t a case of starting from scratch. The company had built up “very strong” long-term relationships with the six banks it borrowed from on a bilateral basis and it didn’t want to lose those alliances. The solution was to syndicate the existing banks: “It meant we gained the best of both worlds: the close one-to-one relationship with each one as well as the syndicate.”</p>
<p>There have been marked cost and economic benefits from the changeover, says Daly: “With the bilateral arrangement we had a number of different facilities maturing at different times so you were frequently into the refinancing of one facility or another. Syndication enables terms and conditions to be aligned and administration to be simplified. This funding structure also allowed James Hardie to finance the acquisition of the German- based business Fermacell in April 2018 with a 364 day term loan. This loan was refinanced in October 2018 with an inaugural EUR bond issuance, following multiple USD bond issuances over the last few years.”</p>
<h3 id=""lessons-learnt"">Lessons learnt</h3>
<p>Overall Daly believes JHIF’s strategy has evolved very well in recent years. Important lessons have been learnt: “A clear strategy is key. Have you got the right banks? Will you need more banks in the future? It’s about aligning funding with the business, so look carefully at what will be needed in a few years’ time and put a funding strategy in place now because it takes time to anticipate the optimal funding requirements and build the right relationships.”</p>
<p>He also urges colleagues evolving their own regime to understand what the banks are looking for bearing in mind that, the pressure is on them to remunerate their capital: “Banks generally need business over and above the lending facilities. It’s also important to make sure they are comfortable with their position within the structure – there’s no point in having a stressed bank as it reduces flexibility when you most need it.”</p>
<p>Daly is keen on treasurers sharing experiences and best practice and as a member of the Irish Association of Corporate Treasurers (IACT), he believes the body is playing a vital role in connecting them. “It’s particularly important for small departments of just one or two people. They often don’t have individuals around them to bounce ideas off and the IACT facilitates that through seminars and various gatherings, encouraging interaction. There are opportunities to critique and understand what’s going on in treasury and build strong relationships with other treasurers.” The IACT’s annual conference takes place on Wednesday 14th November 2018 in Croke Park Stadium, Dublin.</p>

<p>SEEK is a diverse group of companies that have a unified purpose to help people live more fulfilling and productive working lives and help organisations succeed. The company is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange where it is a top 100 company employing over 6,000 people and with a market capitalisation close to AU$6bn.
</p>

<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>Over the past decade, Melbourne headquartered employment marketplace, SEEK, has experienced rapid domestic and international growth. Today, the company is present in 18 markets across Asia Pacific, Africa and South America.</p>
<p>Whilst this growth is fantastic for the company, it has created some interesting challenges for SEEK’s centralised treasury team in Australia. As Malcolm Andrews, Group Treasury Manager at SEEK, explains: “Many of the markets we are present in, such as Brazil, China and South East Asia, operate strict currency controls that make it difficult for us to bring any profits home. This leaves us with significant levels of surplus cash trapped in these countries.”</p>
<p>The issue is especially acute in China, SEEK’s largest overseas market. “Traditionally our business in China has invested most of our surplus cash with domestic Chinese banks in term deposits,” explains Andrews. “However, as our revenues in China have grown, we have looked to strategically diversify our investment portfolio and ensure compliance with our treasury policy, mitigate concentration risk and optimise yield pick-up.”</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>After an evaluation of the investment landscape in China, SEEK’s treasury team selected China International Fund Management Co., Ltd. (CIFM), which is the joint venture between J.P. Morgan Asset Management Limited and Shanghai International Trust Co., Ltd. in China, to be its main provider of short-term investment solutions. “It was a fairly easy decision,” says Jeff Dart, Group Assistant Treasurer at SEEK. “The investment solution provided by CIFM was very conservative, but still delivers a very competitive yield rate, which is in line with our investment policy.”</p>
<p>While yield rate is not guaranteed, CIFM’s solution targets an even more competitive investment return because of a tax advantage. “When we invest in bank deposits, there is a tax that is applied to any yield made on deposits in China,” says Dart. “This reduces the return on investments and adds additional complexity because of the need to account for the tax and work with the Chinese tax authorities. There are no income taxes applied to any fund in China which means higher effective returns and fewer complexities, which is a big bonus for us.”</p>
<p>Solidifying SEEK’s decision to work with CIFM in China is the ability to access liquidity when needed. “SEEK is very active in the mergers and acquisitions space and because of this, often needs access to liquidity quickly, which CIFM’s solution provides,” says Dart.</p>
<p>This is also a reason that SEEK uses J.P. Morgan Asset Management’s AUD denominated local liquidity product in Australia. “The big-four banks in Australia dominate the short-term deposit landscape, but they are mainly focused on term deposits of two, three and six months,” explains Dart. “This doesn’t work for us because of our cash requirements and this is where J.P. Morgan Asset Management step in, providing competitive yield and same-day or next-day access to cash.”</p>
<p>With SEEK enjoying the benefits offered by J.P. Morgan Asset Management’s liquidity solutions in some of its key markets, there is a desire to extend this relationship further. “We are keen to work with J.P. Morgan Asset Management in every market they are present where we have trapped cash,” says Dart. “They are an obvious choice because they provide great diversification and are competitive when it comes to yield.”</p>

<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>Diversified industrials major, thyssenkrupp was blighted by a disparate and highly complex IT architecture comprised of over 100 SAP ERP systems and over 150 non-SAP ERP systems. To make matters worse, these different ERPs had their own interfaces with over 2,000 bank accounts around the world. “Complexity, lack of standardisation, lack of connectivity and lack of automation created many problems,” says Peter Kellner, Group Processes and Information Technology, thyssenkrupp. “This included a lack of visibility over our cash positions, the need to conduct many processes manually and an extremely lengthy and painful process whenever we needed to change anything.”</p>
<p>A group-wide project – codenamed daproh – was launched in 2015. Focusing on data and process harmonisation, it provided the catalyst for Kellner and his team to begin solving these issues and build a global payments platform. With the company looking to move to a single instance of SAP, the treasury team had to devise a way of creating a central platform that would enable it to standardise, warehouse and utilise all the data on the disparate ERP systems. Spotting an opportunity, Kellner also wanted to move away from ad hoc host-to-host (H2H) connectivity with the banks, instead using EBICS or SWIFT to communicate with the Group’s banks from the central ERP.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>Following an extensive research project into the different providers that could help thyssenkrupp achieve its objectives, Kellner and the team opted to utilise Hanse Orga Group’s FinanceSuite (FS). “There were a few different options available, but what set Hanse Orga apart was that its solutions exist within SAP,” he says. “We were also impressed with the user-experience its solutions offered and its high-profile client base.”</p>
<p>To achieve its objectives, thyssenkrupp has adopted a host of Hanse Orga modules. Kellner notes that one of the key components has been the payments solution. The solution gives thyssenkrupp the ability to seamlessly connect its disparate ERP systems to the new central ERP whilst these are phased out. “The solution takes the data from the old ERP systems and converts it into a standardised format that is compatible with the latest version of SAP that we are using,” explains Kellner. “This has enabled us to optimise existing processes without having to wait for the full company-wide migration to be completed.”</p>
<p>Whilst the Payment Management solution has allowed thyssenkrupp to knit together its technology infrastructure internally, the use of the Account Statement Manager, AutoBank and eBAM solutions has driven standardisation and efficiency in how it works with its banking partners. Kellner advises that today, all bank statements sit centrally in the ERP and are processed and reconciled automatically, based on different rules set up by thyssenkrupp. Finally, they also now have central administration of bank accounts, including signature authorisations for all group companies.</p>
<p>As thyssenkrupp upgraded the Group’s ERP system to SAP S/4 HANA 1610, Kellner and his team took the chance to upgrade to the latest version of Hanse Orga FinanceSuite, FS². “We were once again very impressed with how smooth this process was – it took place without any major issues,” he says. “Indeed, throughout our partnership with Hanse Orga, we have been very impressed with its ability to meet our wishes quickly and efficiently, even when we have bespoke in-country requirements in markets like Brazil, for instance.”</p>
<p>Kellner is keen to note that despite all the improvements gained already through its work with Hanse Orga Group, there is still a lot more to be done. “We are continuing to roll out the Hanse Orga Group modules around the world and expanding our use of them to ensure we get maximum value out of the investment,” he says. “We are also looking to take advantage of some of the solutions recently launched by Hanse Orga Group, such as its embargo screening tool which enables payments to be automatically screened against sanctions blacklists before we send it to the banks, ensuring that further STP can be achieved in our payments process.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>Since its launch in 1999, Alibaba.com – the international B2B eCommerce marketplace – has grown exponentially.</p>
<p>Increased collection volume created a challenge for the Alibaba treasury team, whose legacy collections process was manual and ill-equipped to deal with such an inflow. As Griffin Peng, Director of B2B Payment &amp; Financing at Alibaba explains: “Traditionally we asked our overseas buyers to send us payment via wire transfer to our account in Hong Kong. We would then manually reconcile these before distributing the funds to the sellers in mainland China.” The problem with this process, he adds, “is that we found it increasingly difficult to match the incoming funds with the buyer’s orders, leading to delays in distributing the funds to the sellers”.</p>
<p>Not only did this inefficiency harm Alibaba’s image in the eyes of its sellers, it also increased costs due to the need for more manpower. “We realised that if we were to continue supporting business growth, then we would need an automated solution to allow us to reconcile and process these payments quickly and accurately,” says Peng. “We also wanted to do this without changing our customers’ payment experience.”</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>After exploring and evaluating the different products available, Alibaba decided to utilise Citi’s multi-currency Virtual Account Solution. Peng notes that this solution’s ability to automatically match payments with payers, streamlining and automating the reconciliation processes, perfectly matched the requirements of Alibaba.</p>
<p>“The solution enables us to assign each buyer a unique virtual account number that is linked to our master account in Hong Kong,” he explains. “The system can then automatically match the payment with the data that we have on the transaction, allowing us to automate this process.” To drive even more efficiency, Alibaba has established host-to-host connectivity with Citi, facilitating automated payment initiation to Alibaba’s sellers once the incoming payment is reconciled.</p>
<p>Citi worked closely with Alibaba to customise the solution to meet the company’s unique settlement and reporting requirements – the system generates reports every ten minutes. The bank also helped with the technical integration, linking the virtual accounts with Alibaba’s ERP system. Overall, the whole project was delivered in an impressive three-month period.</p>
<p>During the implementation, Citi also made Alibaba aware of another opportunity to drive greater efficiency and cost savings in its collections process. “Citi suggested that we use ACH direct debits in the US and bulk transfer these over to our Hong Kong account,” explains Peng. “This has reduced our international transaction volume and costs considerably.”</p>
<p>Since going live with Citi’s multi-currency virtual account, the Alibaba treasury team has benefited from improved reconciliation rates, leading to time and cost savings. “In addition, we now have greater control over our cash flow – and payment errors have been minimised,” says Peng. “This has all been achieved without changing our customer’s processes.”</p>
<p>Peng notes that the power of Citi’s multi-currency Virtual Account Solution has been recognised by other parts of the group. “There is a lot of interest in potentially rolling out a similar solution to Alibaba’s other business lines in the future,” concludes Peng.</p>

In line with this philosophy, the company historically had a very short-term investment horizon, primarily investing in money market funds (MMFs) and overnight cash deposits. “In times of crisis, such as in 2008, we would go ultra-cautious and invest in short-dated US treasury funds,” explains Alex Fiott, Head of Front Office, Treasury at AstraZeneca.</p>
<p>Although nothing was fundamentally wrong with this approach, Fiott and his colleague Peter Walker-Smith, believed that cash could be managed more actively. They set about reviewing how it segmented its cash and found that much of it could be invested for a longer time horizon, potentially resulting in more yield.</p>
<p>“Being so heavily invested in MMFs that invest in a high concentration of financials meant that AstraZeneca was effectively paying for somebody else’s liquidity,” says Fiott. “This, tied with the changing banking and MMF regulatory landscape, made it a good time to step back and challenge our existing investment policy to see what else we could do. We therefore reached out to our liquidity partners to see what alternative solutions were available.”</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>They decided to use tri-party repurchase agreements (repos) and separately managed accounts<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup> (SMAs) to invest its short-term cash. AstraZeneca chose to use SMAs because of the flexibility they offer. A further benefit was the opportunity for the team to leverage the knowledge and expertise of its fund managers by mandating them to make investments in longer-dated securities on AstraZeneca’s behalf. It was hoped that this would provide incremental returns above those of MMFs, while still retaining the aim of capital preservation and flexible liquidity.</p>
<p>Moving to these products was welcomed by senior management, not least because of the treasury team’s proactive approach. “Given the changing regulatory environment, we were really taking steps to get ahead of the game,” says Fiott. “And because the products we are using fit within the parameters of our existing investment policy, it didn’t take much to persuade the risk committee that this was a positive step to take. The security of capital preservation remained, but our cash worked harder.”</p>
<p>It must be noted, however, that adopting these solutions comes with its challenges. Fiott highlights that the documentation and legal work which is needed can put some corporates off. “It can take several months to do this and there is a lot of ancillary work that is required, especially when setting up a tri-party repo agreement,” he observes. That being said, Fiott notes that the benefits have been well worth this effort<sup id=""fnref:2""><a href=""#fn:2"" rel=""footnote"">2</a></sup>. Not only does AstraZeneca have a more diversified portfolio; the tri-party repos and SMAs are yielding 25/30bps over MMFs a year.</p>
<p>Working with an experienced and trusted liquidity partner such as J.P. Morgan Asset Management has been instrumental to AstraZeneca. “J.P. Morgan Asset Management was our partner on this journey from the very beginning,” says Fiott. “Perhaps what is most important is that they always offer us an unbiased view of what is happening in the market and breadth of solutions that are available. This helps lead us to reach best practice, and focus on our actual needs. Their track record and expertise in operating short-dated liquidity funds also instils confidence when outsourcing your investments to them.”</p>
<p>Fiott notes that segmenting the group’s cash and exploring alternative investment vehicles has been a rewarding exercise for AstraZeneca and one that he would recommend to other corporates. Looking forward, the treasury team is also planning to explore what more can be done to refine the existing product solutions in order to diversify further thus continuing a proactive approach to managing liquidity.</p>

<p><i>For global confectionery giant Mars, legacy technology meant that the company’s FX dealing processes were at times inefficient and error-prone.

<p>Headquartered in the US, Mars Incorporated is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of confectionery, pet food and other food products. With a workforce of over 80,000 people in 78 countries around the world the company achieved annual sales of US$33bn in 2015.</p>

<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>Given the company’s global reach, the effective management of FX is a crucial tenet of the overall risk management function at Mars. However, the company’s legacy technology infrastructure was causing the treasury team a considerable headache.</p>
<p>Challenges were primarily caused by the outdated treasury management system (TMS), which was prone to crashing – especially at critical times such as during the treasury’s routine trading window. The system also didn’t allow Mars to trade multiple value dates simultaneously, which exacerbated the workload for the currency team.</p>
<p>To complicate matters further, the treasury still relied on spreadsheets for around a quarter of its trades. “Unsurprisingly, errors were common,” says Alex Haigh, Regional Currency Manager EMEA at Mars Chocolate. “We had to spend a significant amount of time finding the errors in the spreadsheet and correcting these. Even when everything worked, there was limited straight through processing. A significant amount of time was spent manually managing each trade.”</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>It was clear that the situation needed to be addressed. The treasury team had already been using Thomson Reuters FXall for deal execution for some time, but much of the functionality remained untapped. The implementation of a new TMS provided an opportunity to leverage the functionality offered by the system more effectively by closely integrating FXall into the new TMS.</p>
<p>“We talked to our Thomson Reuters relationship manager about our new TMS installation and what we wanted to achieve. They then worked seamlessly with the TMS provider, explaining how the FX account structure at Mars worked, which then enabled FXall to be bolted onto the system seamlessly and to our exact specifications,” explains Haigh. “We then vigorously tested FXall within the new TMS architecture using different currency pairs, deal volumes and multiple value dates and found that very few issues occurred. After this we were able to go live – it was incredibly straightforward and seamless.”</p>
<p>The integration of Thomson Reuters FXall into the new TMS has transformed FX dealing for Mars. “We now run the numbers in the TMS and once we accept the hedge recommendation we are able to export these instructions into FXall,” Haigh explains. “Once the deal is executed in the module, confirmation will be received in less than one minute. This will then be sent back to the TMS and the system will be updated automatically, allowing us to instantly run new reports and share these with other departments in the company.”</p>
<p>Enabling the full functionality of Thomson Reuters FXall by integrating it into the company’s new TMS has delivered a plethora of benefits for Mars. Haigh claims that around 12 working days a year have been saved through the efficiency provided by the new set-up and the ability to trade multiple value dates in one transaction. “What is more, we are also saving a significant amount of time by no longer having to spend hours finding errors in spreadsheets – these have been completely eradicated from the process.”</p>
<p>Mars has also posted impressive cost savings. “FXall always enabled us to get best price execution,” says Haigh. “But now we have unleashed its full functionality, we are able to achieve a netting benefit as well when trading multiple value dates. We are saving tens of thousands of dollars a year on spreads as a result.”</p>
<p>More benefits may follow. “Now that we are using FXall to its fullest, it is providing us with a richness of data that we never had before, enabling us to leverage numerous analytical tools and ensure we are operating best-in-class,” adds Haigh. “We are now able to use these insights to build better FX hedging strategies and look at ways to add more value to the business.”</p>

<p>BASF is the world’s leading chemical company. The cash management function in the Germany-based Shared Services Center – BASF Services Europe GmbH – takes responsibility for the European bank account management. Given the scale of the operation, this demands tight control over key tasks such as account opening and closing, managing signatories, and validating year-end closing statements.</p>



<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>Although BASF Services Europe is a long-haul SAP user, its core banking data had historically been stored and managed in a series of Excel spreadsheets. With manual processes and even paper-based analysis being executed in support of bank account management (BAM), it was increasingly apparent to Cornelia Hesse, Head of Cash Management, that process tracking, auditability and resource allocation was falling short of her required efficiency and effectiveness targets.</p>
<p>Whilst Hesse admits that aspects of BAM are “not amongst the most interesting tasks in treasury”, she absolutely acknowledges the importance of clear and correct record keeping. A call for data from an on-site auditor, for example, must be handled quickly and with precision. The most desirable way to achieve this, she believes, is to automate the entire process, facilitating timely delivery of accurate data “at the push of a button”.</p>
<p>Hesse had a clear set of goals to achieve. She was seeking to reduce complexity, paperwork and the time-consuming and risk-laden nature of manual BAM tasks through automation of all BAM processes within SAP. She also sought to create a procedure for heightening BASF Services Europe’s audit compliance. This, she felt, would in part be achieved through electronic storage and archiving of all bank account data – including legal forms, terms and conditions and correspondence.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>Following a full scope of the market for solutions, a timely meeting with an existing provider – the SAP-certified financial technology and consultancy firm, Hanse Orga – revealed the most promising option for Hesse. The vendor had just announced that it was going to market with its own XML-based FS² eBAM (electronic BAM) offering.</p>
<p>Having signed up as an early adopter, the implementation lineup (sourced mainly from Hesse’s team and internal IT) was subject to a tight six-month schedule. In order to expedite the project, Hanse Orga worked towards delivering a ‘train the trainer’ model. Working closely with a key member of Hesse’s team during the set-up stage enabled the cascading of information to other BASF Services Europe personnel.</p>
<p>As the project progressed, this model created an exponential flow of knowledge across the whole team. It worked. The project finished one month ahead of schedule. It helped that there were no connectivity issues to report but Hesse’s approach was such that the “house-keeping” of all data – ensuring it was de-duped and as clean and normalised as possible pre-migration – was managed to perfection in-house. “We like to be the master of our own data,” she states. “It’s easy to have a consultant helping but at some stage they will go. You must take responsibility for your own data.”</p>
<p>With the solution fully rolled-out to the companies within the service group, and with new entities capable of being brought on-board immediately, Hesse has a clear sense of what has been accomplished. “I had to have a business case for the project application and I have achieved that,” she says with justified pride. “Our data is always up to date, we can track all open requests and the documentation is always available. It also means any audit requests, wherever they are issued from, are easily managed. What we expected was met.”</p>
<p>But Hesse and the team are not finished yet. Full automation, with end-to-end electronic processes between BASF Services Europe and all of its banks, is not yet a reality. This, she states, is not a reflection on Hanse Orga. “We already have the eBAM solution but we will only have true eBAM when the bank account opening, closing and changing process is fully supported by banks in an electronic manner,” she explains. “This is what all corporates and banks need to work on.”</p>
<p>The independent SWIFT CGI-MP workgroup (a multi-agency forum dedicated to progressing various corporate-to-bank connectivity topics) continues to engage all stakeholders in achieving this goal through the development of common message standards. In the meantime, having partnered with Hanse Orga in its move towards full automation, BASF Services Europe is very much in an advanced state of readiness for the moment this becomes a reality. And, adds Hesse, with the right tools in place, she is now insisting that all future cash management banking proposals feature the functionality to deliver eBAM.</p>

<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>Given its position in the market, global supply chain manager, Li &amp; Fung process a large number of trade transactions on a daily basis. The company had established host-to-host connectivity with Citi’s payment factory, allowing it to automate the execution of many of these payments and alleviate much of the manual work that was previously required.</p>
<p>But while Li &amp; Fung’s payment process had been automated and made highly efficient, its trade financing activity was largely manual. “Traditionally, our working capital needs were largely bridged by unsecured credit facilities” notes Denis Savastano, Corporate Treasurer at Li &amp; Fung. “These credit facilities are quite pricey and required substantial manpower to process.”</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>Together with Citi a solution was developed that leverages the host-to-host connectivity and enables Li &amp; Fung to issue standing trade finance instructions linked to its trade transactions through the ERP system. These instructions then flow straight through to Citi, allowing the bank to approve and process these in accordance with the standing instructions pre-agreed by Li &amp; Fung in a fully automated fashion.</p>
<p>Li &amp; Fung also had to make sure that the solution met its governance requirements. As such, Citi ensured that appropriate authorisation protocols were put in place to guarantee that only key signatories were able to initiate any financing requests.</p>



<blockquote>Throughout this journey the bank proved to us that they are not simply a provider of solutions, but a trusted business partner.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source""></p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>From an efficiency perspective, the benefits of this approach are clear. “The cumbersome manual processes and heavy documentary burden that traditionally slowed trade financing was greatly alleviated,” says Savastano. “The fact that the solution is fully automated, end-to-end, means that the risk of human error and fraud has been reduced.”</p>
<p>Substantial cost savings have also been achieved for the group. “We benchmarked the pricing that different banks were offering for the various types of facilities that would cover our working capital requirements,” he says. This innovative and highly customised global solution was implemented within a short timeframe of three months. “Given the tight deadline for the project it was vital for there to be close collaboration between ourselves and Citi for it to be successful,” notes Savastano. “Thankfully, Citi already had an intimate understanding of our business and what we are trying to achieve, as well as the trust of key executives within our organisation.”</p>
<p>But what was most crucial for Savastano was Citi’s willingness to go above and beyond to make sure the project was a success. “Throughout this journey the bank proved to us that they are not simply a provider of solutions, but a trusted business partner. They offered excellent project management to make sure that it ran smoothly, as well as sharing their expertise and insights gained from a wealth of experience working on other similar projects at every stage of the process.”</p>
<p>Having achieved these benefits from the import and export trade solution, Savastano and his treasury team at Li &amp; Fung are pleased with the results. “We are always looking at solutions that can benefit the group and its shareholders. And the host-to-host connectivity that exists between ourselves and Citi is a great channel for us to use and we hope to be able to leverage this further in the near future.”</p>

Lupin is the fifth largest and fastest growing top ten generics player in the US (IMS Health) and the third largest Indian-pharmaceutical company through sales globally. The Company is also the fastest growing top ten generic pharmaceutical players in Japan (ranked ninth) and South Africa (ranked fourth – IMS Health).</p>

<h2 id=""problem"">Problem...</h2>
<p>With the business growing very rapidly, Indian pharmaceutical giant Lupin was finding the administration around marketing spend for the various promotional events it hosts increasingly complex and time consuming. Traditionally, administration around such payments was conducted manually. Marketing personnel across various departments and regions would reach out to the central administration team for payment of the required hotel arrangements, which would then be paid in advance or with a credit card number belonging, more often than not, to a senior representative of the admin team.</p>
<p>The process created a heavy workload across the company. Treasury had to ensure that the account for making these payments was funded on a regular basis. Reconciling transactions, managing vendors and attempting to gain visibility and control over spend for promotional events was also proving increasingly time consuming for admin staff.</p>
<p>“Our traditional methodology worked while the company was still relatively small,” says Suresh Chettiar, Vice President – Treasury, Lupin Limited. But with the company averaging 20 to 22% CAGR in revenue over the past ten years, marketing spends were also growing. A new way of working was evidently required. “As the company grew over a period of time, handling our marketing spend in this way became quite tedious and difficult,” Chettiar explains. “And that is why we started looking for a solution.”</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">...Solved</h2>
<p>A solution was required that would meet the demands of each of the three main internal stakeholders: marketing, administration and treasury. The company’s marketing executives wished for a solution allowing staff to simply make a telephone call to colleagues in the admin team with details of the booking required to get a budget assigned. The admin team, on the other hand, wanted something offering simpler reconciliation and greater visibility and control over payments. Finally, given the very large value of the sums being spent on events, treasury required a solution that would allow it to extend payment terms to improve working capital metrics.</p>
<p>After carefully considering the problem, Citi suggested a virtual card solution to be integrated into Lupin’s internal workflow. Using Citi’s Virtual Card Platform, a unique 16 digit card number is generated every time there is a request for payment. These card numbers can be generated for specific values, validity dates, merchant categories or even suppliers – thereby eliminating risk of misuse or fraud. The vendor, having received the card, then accepts the payment and the bookings are confirmed.</p>
<p>A company-designed authorisation matrix is accessed on the platform providing controls on the issuance of credit card number. Citi’s solution gives Lupin’s team capability to input up to 30 fields of enhanced data at the time of card generation including department information and invoice details, amongst others. A consolidated management information system (MIS), including the enhanced data and payment information, is shared back with the designated administrators within Lupin.</p>
<p>The whole process around event payments is running much more smoothly now. Marketing executives can select a venue for an event without any time constraints, coordinate payment for the event with the admin team, and have a wider choice of event hotels and venues to the dealing teams, thanks to Citi’s Virtual Card Platform. In essence, they have all the information they need to process the transaction at their fingertips. Working capital blockages have also been removed since payments for events no longer need to be made upfront. Finally, reconciliation is greatly simplified thanks to the additional data elements captured with each payment request and offers convenience to marketing, administration and accounts teams.</p>
<p>Of all the solutions on the market, Lupin felt Citi’s Virtual Card solution was the best fit. The strength of the company’s relationship with Citi and its confidence in the bank’s support staff were identified by Chettiar as important factors in that decision. “We have a lot of experience working with Citi and that provides great trust and comfort,” he says. “Because of that we know if something does go wrong, Citi has a very strong backup team”. Chettiar says, “the solution represents a landmark shift for Lupin, and the company is now looking to increase the coverage. We are extremely satisfied with the solution,” he says, “and that is why we wish to expand it into new areas.”</p>

<p><em>Treasury Today Asia explores how J.P. Morgan Global Liquidity’s money market fund offerings solved Alibaba Group’s requirement for a short-term liquidity investment instrument at a time when the availability of suitable options was limited.</em></p>



<h3 class=""fn"">Randy Ou</h3>
<h5 class=""title"">Vice President, Treasury, The Alibaba Group</h5>
<p>The Alibaba Group, a global leader in online and mobile commerce, provides the fundamental technology infrastructure and marketing reach to help merchants, brands and other businesses that provide products, services and digital content, engage with their users and customers through the power of the internet.</p>



<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>With a strong renminbi (RMB) cash position in onshore China, Alibaba’s treasury team were looking for short-term liquidity investment tools that would give them a better yield without compromising liquidity. Yet at a time when China had not begun to liberalise its interest rate market, higher yielding cash investment products meeting Alibaba’s corporate investment criteria were very few and far between. Alibaba’s treasury team needed not only a short-term investment solution offering higher yield with liquidity, but also one that would meet their expectations in terms of transparency and credit rating.</p>
<p>As Randy Ou, Vice President, Treasury at Alibaba Group explains: “A few years back when China’s interest rate market was not as market-driven as it is now, our options were limited. What’s more, the choice of investment tools with a satisfactory credit rating was even more restricted back then.”</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>Then Alibaba’s treasury team began to familiarise itself with the RMB money market fund (MMF) offerings distributed by J.P. Morgan Global Liquidity (JPM GL)<sup id=""fnref:1""><a href=""#fn:1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup>. “Investing with JPM GL gave us a new perspective,” Ou says. In 2013, Alibaba’s treasury team first began investing in the JPM GL’s RMB MMF offering in relatively small amounts. These amounts gradually increased in scale over the space of two years as the RMB MMF offering steadily gained the confidence of Alibaba’s treasury team. “For us it was really straightforward,” Ou says, “at that time we had real business needs and JPM GL had the solution that met our requirements”. Such requirements met by JPM GL’s RMB MMF offerings included:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The T+1 feature meets the company’s daily liquidity needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The MMF’s transparency and AAA rating by an international rating agency means it can be accepted by both internal and external stakeholders. The fund’s AAA rating is important, Ou explains, because Alibaba, like many companies, has minimum rating requirements for different types of investments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dividends paid by the MMF are exempt from corporate income tax, something which is not always the case with investment products in China.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But the investment solution’s benefits extended far beyond the immediate benefits of achieving a better yield and highly flexible RMB liquidity. Working with a global partner improved options for Alibaba’s offshore liquidity too, helping their treasury team meet its liquidity demands globally. The relationship has also helped Alibaba benchmark investment decisions against those of its industry peers through the opportunity to participate in the annual J.P. Morgan Global Liquidity Investment PeerView℠ survey. This flagship survey captures the investment behaviour of CIOs, treasurers and other senior decision makers around the world to identify critical trends in the money market funds space, with the 2015 survey attracting over 400 participants.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Alibaba’s treasury found in JPM GL all the qualities they were looking for in a liquidity solutions partner: the ability to achieve balance between international standard and local specialty, risk management capability, dedicated client service and, last but not least, the capability to deliver good investment return.</p>
<p>Ou expects many more corporate cash investors to follow Alibaba’s example and begin investing in RMB MMFs especially at a time when banking regulation is making banks more selective about the liquidity they accept from companies. “Compared with US and Europe, the percentage allocated to MMF by cash investors is still small,” he says. “Though the MMF market is not well developed in Asia yet, I can see an acceleration and progress is certainly being made. That also means it has room to grow, particularly if more banks start to have concerns on taking deposits because of implementation of Basel III.”</p>
<p>The regulatory environment around interest rates and deposits in China is changing rapidly. But for Ou that only underscores the importance of having a liquidity solutions partner that can demonstrate, in his words, “a proven track record”, and has the expertise to help the corporate treasury function identify and navigate through important regulatory developments.</p>
<p>Thanks to the implementation of a successful short-term liquidity strategy provided by JPM GL, Alibaba can now enjoy the flexibility of daily liquidity for its ever-growing RMB cash balances, in addition to JPM GL’s invaluable liquidity expertise and robust risk management capabilities.</p>

<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>CPN is currently undergoing a period of expansion in its home market of Thailand. The rapid growth, however, exposed a number of shortcomings and friction points across the organisation’s processes. In reaction to this the company has in recent years given a significant amount of attention to improving the overall process efficiency across the group to ensure it can meet both its immediate and future objectives.</p>
<p>A major area of focus for CPN was driving efficiency in the treasury and finance function. As Piyada Sookaimoath, Assistant Vice President, Corporate Finance Division at CPN explains, “Historically the function was very labour intensive. We manually managed nearly all of our processes, especially in liquidity management, whilst also supervising close to 200 accounts. The treasury’s time was therefore spent on these tasks rather than on adding value to the business and assisting with its expansion plans.” These challenges were amplified as the company expanded and its operations became increasingly complex.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>In order to resolve these issues, the company launched an ambitious project to streamline its bank accounts, automate its payments and receivables where possible and ensure its cash was being used efficiently. To do this, CPN’s treasury drew up a list of requirements to increase overall process efficiency. These included: seamless integration with SAP, producing more efficient reporting and reconciliation, improving end-to-end security and control and providing excellent customer service to businesses.</p>
<p>Citi was selected to fulfil the requirements. CPN’s treasury team felt the solutions offered by Citi and Kasikorn Bank (KBank); Citi’s partner bank, best fit the objectives of the treasury as well as minimising the switching cost for the company and its clients.</p>
<p>For improved liquidity management, the solutions offered by Citi included: a single bank account to enhance visibility and control, a fully automated cash pooling system which eliminated manual processes for cash consolidation and single collection and payment data files and reports. The company was able to reduce its number of bank accounts from close to 200 to only 24, lessening the resource burden associated with managing these. Moreover, as Sookaimoath explains: “A number of cash pooling structures are available without a credit facility. If credit support is needed for other purposes, however, Citi will provide an umbrella facility for the cash pooling, it is very flexible to our needs.”</p>
<p>To streamline the collections process, Citi provided virtual accounts to help identify payers and remove the need to manually track payments. This information is fed through a single collection channel, providing better visibility and access to the data. This can then be analysed through Citi’s Receivables Vision analysis tool which helps the CPN treasury team to more accurately predict its future cash flow. Moreover, since local regulations stipulate that foreign banks are only allowed to set up one branch in Thailand, Citi has worked seamlessly with CPN’s local partner bank, KBank, to support the conglomerate’s local collections nationwide, giving the company the local coverage it requires.</p>
<p>CPN’s payments processes have been streamlined through the use of Citi’s Payment solutions which allows CPN to send a variety of payment types, with multiple value dates, in one single consolidated file via host-to-host connectivity. Moreover, this process has been fully integrated into SAP, providing an automated end-to-end payment process.</p>
<p>Today, 26 local entities and two entities in Malaysia have joined the scheme. Going forward, CPN is aiming to grow three to four property development projects per year in Thailand and expand into other South East Asia markets. It is therefore vital that the solutions are scalable to allow more entities to be on-boarded quickly and efficiently. Citi’s extensive global network will also play a key role in facilitating CPN’s growth overseas.</p>

<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>Merging multiple companies is always going to be a challenge – and with more than 200 legal entities in total – the scale of the task involved in managing payments to the company’s subsidiaries and joint ventures was enormous. Moreover, the merger created a decentralised structure which brought problems in getting a complete view of the company’s funding and liquidity to the table. “We knew it would take some years to align payment terms and contracts, to integrate systems and to merge departments,” explains Kim Japp, Director of DONG Energy’s Financial Shared Service Centre. “We started with totally decentralised accounting and finance functions in each business unit. It was only in 2011 that we formed our shared services centre (SSC) and centralised payments, by which point we were in a position to look ahead at how we could optimise our transactions and payments,” Japp continues. Having been engaged in a close dialogue with Nordea since the merger in 2006, it was a natural choice to turn to this banking partner when the company embarked on an ambitious multi-year programme of activities with the vision of establishing an internal bank and payment factory, as well as a completely centralised treasury function.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>Having worked with DONG Energy in the cash management area for some years, Nordea had a firm understanding of the intricacies of the company’s operations. As such, Nordea proposed its new Global Cash Pool solution to provide greater visibility across countries, currencies and accounts. Nordea worked closely with the company to define the rollout phases. The first steps were taken across Denmark, Norway and Sweden in January 2012 and the solution went live in November that year, with the company’s numerous UK accounts added to the pool in October 2013. But the company’s collaboration with Nordea didn’t stop there. After DONG Energy set up an SSC with the ambition to introduce an internal bank and payment factory, the company began looking for a solution that would enable payments to and from all subsidiaries to be centrally approved directly within its SAP system. This time, Nordea proposed that the company migrate to its eGateway solution which would provide the treasury department with greater efficiency and enhanced liquidity management.</p>
<p>The project of simplifying payments with Nordea’s eGateway began in December 2013 with a series of ambitious milestones and deadlines that needed to be met. Inevitably – with DONG Energy’s complex business structure including many companies and joint ventures that require specific payment processes and handling – there were challenges to overcome. Nordea responded by assigning a project organisation with a dedicated manager to keep stakeholders informed and solve problems. As DONG Energy didn’t just contact a service desk, “it helped a lot,” explains Anne Heidemann, Director, Treasury Front Office, DONG Energy. “Of course, there were hiccups, but what was important was that everybody collaborated and focused on solving them quickly.” The result: the new payments platform was live by the end of September 2014 (during the same year, the company’s cash pooling solution was also extended to handle internal balance transfers with support the new internal bank model).</p>
<p>Both solutions (Nordea’s Global Cash Pool and eGateway) are fully integrated into the company’s SAP and treasury management system, as well as the shared services and treasury processes. “These have been two major projects and the implementation has been a complete success. Now DONG Energy has truly updated, modernised and enhanced its core finance processes, producing tangible results,” says Japp. Both Japp and Heidemann also note that no comprehensive business change is easy, but the results are often worth the complex transition phase. “The collaboration between DONG Energy and Nordea has produced real benefits in cash management,” explains Japp. “We have much more solid payment processes now, which is saving us money as well as reducing operational risk. It’s hard to overstate the value this delivers to the business.”</p>

<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>Like many companies operating in China, IBM historically had restrictions with moving cash in and out of the country. Traditional structures to fund working capital either created entrustment loans which are inefficient, or required onshore bank financing which was more expensive than using internal sources of cash. As a result, IBM experienced an increased cost of doing business in China. Each local entity conducted their business directly with offshore IBM entities and vendors which generated high volumes of two-way, cross-border, foreign currency payments with associated compliance requirements. The model was decentralised with foreign exchange (FX) conducted at the entity level with limited opportunities for consolidation.</p>

<p>The regulatory changes introduced in the first half of 2014 by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) provided an opportunity for IBM to implement a more efficient and effective cash management solution in China. IBM could now centralise working capital funding and FX management to drive down costs whilst also integrating China into the group’s global in-house bank. Working with Citi, IBM received approval from SAFE under the Foreign Currency (FCY) Centralised Management Programme in November 2014 to implement a new solution under the FCY Pilot Programme. SAFE allowed IBM to utilise its entity registered in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone (SFTZ) to roll out a number of solutions including: an automated FCY cross border pool between the SFTZ and London, a FCY intercompany netting solution, and a FCY payment on behalf of/receipt on behalf of (POBO/ROBO) solution to streamline 3<sup>rd</sup> party transactions.</p>
<p>Citi was selected to work on the project after IBM conducted a thorough RFP process. “The FCY Pilot Programme has helped solve many of the challenges that we faced in China,” says Chang. “We are now able to bring cash in and out of the country thanks to the cross-border pooling structure and this offers much greater flexibility in funding.” Although there are still limits to the amount of cash that IBM can move in and out of the country, the automated nature of the solution means that IBM can keep within the SAFE borrowing/lending quotas whilst minimising the actual amount of foreign debt quota leveraged. “The fact that the limit applies to the whole group and not each individual entity also gives us the flexibility to make sure that the correct entity receives funding at the right time,” adds Chang.</p>
<p>The unique approval from SAFE allowed all FCY intercompany netting settlements to be settled in RMB which, aligned with an automated domestic RMB cash pool, meant that IBM was able to eliminate all but one of their FCY accounts in China and could move working capital funding more efficiently to their China entities. Citi’s solution has streamlined payment supporting documentation, significantly reduced the number of cross-border payments, reduced transaction costs and centralised FX to save on FX margins. The solution has also allowed IBM to centralise and standardise treasury processes in China to be the same as their global in-house bank. Significant operational, administrative and funding efficiencies have been generated. “Combined these benefits have brought numerous cost savings and allowed us to leverage economies of scale to obtain the best deals reducing the cost of doing business in China,” says Chang.</p>
<p>The structure that IBM has implemented demonstrates how SAFE has made China a more business-friendly environment in which to operate. “If you compare what we can do now, with what we were able to do a few years ago, it is a remarkable change and most, if not all, of the roadblocks that previously prevented a treasury efficiently operating in the country have now been removed,” says Chang. “This is something that we greatly appreciate and I am sure that going forward many more companies will be able to reap numerous benefits from these changes.”</p>



","Moving cash in and out of China was once a big headache for corporates operating in that country. Thankfully, that is now changing. In this article, IBM tells Treasury Today how regulatory changes allowed it to implement a more efficient and effective cash management solution enabling entities in China to centralise funding and FX and standardise processes into the group's global in-house bank.",,2015-07-01,Case Studies,True

<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>Prior to September 2014, TE had relied on a manual process to move cash in and out of China to its entities abroad. Constrained by the previous government regulation, sweeping funds could take up to two months, leading to inefficient leverage of the cash available to the company.</p>
<p>“Moving cash in and out of China had always been a challenge for us, as it is for most corporations with operations in the country,” explains Wei Ming Ho, Senior Treasury Manager, Asia Pacific, at TE. “Applications to the regulator for cash transfers in and out of China would take a month or more, and then only after obtaining necessary approvals could we finally carry out a manual sweep.”</p>
<p>China is one of the company’s key markets in the Asia-Pacific region, so this inefficient leverage of cash in the country was a major concern. “We wanted a more efficient and effective way to optimise our cash in China and mobilize excess cash in China for global use, as the existing method was tedious and inefficient,” says Ho.</p>
<p>TE needed a mechanism that would automatically manage cash to create an acceptable balance that meets operational requirements both for TE’s mainland China entities as well as entities abroad and sweep excess cash into its existing RMB account in London, similar to what is currently possible in less-regulated jurisdictions such as Hong Kong and Singapore. New regulatory developments in China now allow for such a setup to be feasible. “With the changes in regulation in China, this is the ideal time to put in place an automated process that will address our cash management challenges and strengthen our ability to plan, manage, monitor and control our cash flows,” she adds.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>TE was able to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its cash management by implementing Citi’s pioneering automated RMB cross-border sweep solution. In partnership with Citi, TE was able to link its domestic RMB pool in China into a special RMB account with Citi Shanghai, supported by the correct documentation. The Special RMB Account was then linked to an RMB account with Citi London operated by TE’s Treasury Centre, which is based in Switzerland.</p>
<p>The solution allows TE to easily identify and meet liquidity requirements domestically across a series of entities and accounts, before excess funds are swept automatically at true end of day from Citi Shanghai to Citi London. The reverse is also possible with the solution: RMB balances held with Citi London can be used to rectify negative positions incurred within the domestic pool operated by TE with Citi in China.</p>
<p>“This solution has alleviated the challenge of managing cash in China and consolidating our cash in-house,” says Ho. “We are also seeing significant savings in terms of labour process and time efficiency. The previous process took more than a month, but now cash is automatically swept the same day.” Furthermore, the solution was implemented two weeks ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>Citi’s solution is the first cross-border automatic lending structure from outside the Shanghai Free Trade Zone in China to London. The project connects TE’s Multi-Currency Notional Pool with Citi London and its balances in China. As part of Citi’s mandate, excess liquidity held with TE’s domestic cash pool in China (which is implemented with another global bank) is moved to Citi Shanghai accounts before being swept to Citi London.</p>
<p>Citi’s automated RMB cross-border sweep has satisfied TE’s needs. The efficiency of Citi’s cross-border sweeps allows TE to achieve greater flexibility to maximise net cash flows and move cash in a timely manner. The solution is also advantageous to TE as many of its counterparts already use Citi. Ho concludes, “With this cross-border solution now in place, we have laid the foundation to explore even more advanced solutions as regulation in China continues to become liberalised.”</p>

<br/>
<p>Founded in 1997, China Shipping Container Lines (CSCL) is one of the world’s largest integrated international container transportation, logistics and terminal companies. The company operates nearly 80 international and domestic trade routes with a service network that covers Chinese coastal areas and major trade regions in Asia, Europe, America, Africa and the Persian Gulf.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>As a flagship state-owned business, China Shipping Container Lines (CSCL) has experienced rapid growth in recent years, and has a strong commitment to financial integrity and transparency. Consequently, group treasury was seeking to enhance its financial reporting in order to achieve more timely, accurate and complete access to cash flow and balance information globally. “By doing so, the company would be able to plan cash and liquidity decisions with more confidence, analyse cash flow trends effectively, and reduce the cost and resources required for financial reporting,” says Ms. Rong Li, Deputy General Manager, Finance Department, China Shipping Container Lines Co. Ltd. These objectives were particularly challenging bearing in mind that few solutions in mainland China provide cash flow forecasting capabilities.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>CSCL has had a highly successful partnership with Citi for more than a decade, including cash collections and cross-border cash pooling for its entities in more than 40 countries. Based on this experience, the company recognised Citi’s expertise in delivering flexible and robust cash and liquidity management solutions, and innovative technology.</p>
<p>CSCL’s treasury therefore decided to expand the relationship with Citi to implement TreasuryVision®, including its cash flow forecasting module. “We are the first company in mainland China to do so. The solution covers accounts with Citi globally, including accounts held with third-party banks during subsequent project phases. Not only does TreasuryVision® support CSCL’s cash visibility and forecasting objectives, the solution was more cost-effective than treasury management or ERP solutions,” explains Ms. Rong Li.</p>
<p>With TreasuryVision®, CSCL now has timely, accurate and complete visibility over its cash positions and fund movements. Information can be consolidated at different levels, from group level through to individual business segments, regions and business units. Cash flow forecasting capabilities are supplemented with a variety of advanced analysis tools such as variance analysis, what-if calculations and stress testing, and workflow tools such as personalised alerts of account movements. As treasury no longer has to produce this information manually, the risk of error or omission is eliminated, resourcing requirements are greatly reduced, and information can be produced quickly and in a flexible format.</p>
<p>“Implementing Citi’s TreasuryVision has been a vital step in transforming our treasury function into a highly automated, efficient department that will position the company for future international growth. With greater visibility and insights into current and future cash flows, we are now in a position to manage liquidity and risk in an efficient and cost-effective way,” says Ms. Rong Li.</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) is an innovative, global, next generation IT solutions provider and a leader in offering technology solutions to solve every day operational challenges. Through an organisational transformation, the company recently centralised and relocated its Asia Pacific regional treasury structure and shared service centre (SSC) from Singapore to India. The project also included an upgrade to a new iteration of its SAP system within the region.</p>


<h2>Problem…</h2>
<p>The SAP migration was scheduled to take place on 1<sup>st</sup> April 2013, to coincide with the new financial year. However, the old and new systems were unable to run in parallel, and all projects had to launch concurrently. As a result the CSC treasury team was faced with a number of challenges when implementing the solution. According to Mark Greenhalgh, Director, Treasury – EMEA and Asia, CSC, “the four-month timescale allowed little time to test payment files before the cutover, a factor made more difficult by the broad scope of the initial implementation, ranging across eight countries in Asia Pacific including Singapore, Japan and China.” The treasury project also had to fit seamlessly with a number of other organisational changes. “Given these dynamics, it was a very ambitious project, both in terms of what we did and when we did it,” Greenhalgh says.</p>


<h2>…Solved</h2>
<p>To successfully complete such a challenging project, CSC required a banking partner that could offer not only the products but also constant support and a deep knowledge base. For CSC, Citi ticked all the boxes in helping to address its transformational objectives. “Citi was already our primary operational banking partner across Asia Pacific,” says Greenhalgh. “We therefore knew Citi would have the ability to support us and have products that suited our requirements.”</p>
<p>Phase one of the project was launched in January 2013 as CSC began to implement host-to-host connectivity and Citi’s ERP integrator solution. “The ERP integrator was a very useful tool for us because it takes the raw SAP information and converts it into XML format which banking platforms can understand,” says Greenhalgh. “Without this product, we would have to use a number of different file format structures.” With the time saved by the ERP integrator solution, the CSC team could focus on testing the host to host connectivity and refreshing its master vendor data so that countries could move into production testing as soon as the SAP cutover occurred.</p>
<p>Once established, Citi’s integrated technology solution ensured CSC had a robust, XML-based, host-to-host solution to facilitate the operational processing move from Singapore to India. Despite the pressure, CSC was able to meet its 1<sup>st</sup> April 2013 deadline. “Citi was very supportive and assigned us an excellent project management team,” says Greenhalgh. Frequent contact was maintained throughout the project between Citi, CSC’s on-the-ground testing team, and its SAP experts based in Germany. “Citi gave expert advice on what issues they encountered and the areas they believed we should focus on,” says Greenhalgh.</p>
<p>To date, CSC has achieved around 80% of its overall transformation programme including overlaying a liquidity management solution across its operational accounts, offering additional access to liquidity and harnessing greater financial flexibility. The company is also continuing work with Citi to roll out the technology and pooling solutions across the next phase of locations in the Asia Pacific region. Since the project began, CSC has undertaken an additional financial transformation project. “This initiative seeks to further standardise our processes across the world,” says Greenhalgh. “The standardisation which has been established will assist with moving to a SWIFT based connectivity. The financial transformation project dictates that we have XML in place across the world. The fact that we have already established XML standards in Asia Pacific means we are ahead of the game.”</p>
<p>Despite the initial challenges, CSC has achieved far-reaching benefits with its bold transformation vision and productive partnership with Citi. “We will change the way we interact with our banks as a result of the project and the host-to-host connectivity in place with Citi cements our relationship with them in Asia Pacific,” says Greenhalgh.</p>

<br/>
<p>ERCO is a family-owned medium-sized company headquartered in Lüdenscheid, Germany. The company was founded in 1934 and has grown to become one of Europe’s leading manufacturers of architectural lighting and lighting control, with a footprint in a number of major markets including the US, UK, China and South America. In the 2012-2013 financial year the group recorded consolidated sales figures of €135m.</p>


<h2>Problem…</h2>
<p>With more than three-quarters of group revenues generated abroad and volatile cash positions in each country, managing currency risks is of vital importance to the continued financial health of lighting manufacturer ERCO. Before taking into account natural hedges, the company’s foreign exchange exposures amount to approximately €20.1m. The treasury department at ERCO is aware that, when it comes to managing an exposure of this scale, visibility into the cash positions of business units is almost as important as hedging itself. “Being such a global business, with a different and strongly fluctuating cash situation in each country, we needed to optimise our cash and information management,” says Urs Müller-Ortolf, Head of Finance and Controlling at ERCO.</p>
<p>Cash pooling, of course, is the most efficient and cost-effective means for corporates to allocate group liquidity. However, ERCO, with multiple banking partners across the globe was looking for something that would provide treasury an overview of accounts held with, not just one, but all its banks. Complicating matters further, the finance department insisted that the preferred solution should allow processed account information to be made available electronically for straight through processing (STP) in the company’s SAP R/3, eliminating the need for the company to employ and maintain multiple systems.</p>


<h2>…Solved</h2>
<p>“We decided to go with the solutions offered by Commerzbank, as these are flexibly tailored to our company’s specific requirements,” says Müller-Ortolf. The first milestone towards a more efficient cash management operation was made through the establishment of a global information management system. Cash pooling involves far-reaching changes to intra-group processes, but with the help of Commerzbank, the set-up and transmission procedure for electronic account information from third-party banks in Germany and abroad was implemented quickly and with minimum disruption.</p>
<p>The data provided via the SWIFT MT 940 standard was made available for ERCO to call up along with the account information from Commerzbank. Here, ERCO adopted Commerzbank’s electronic banking application, Commerzbank MultiCash. With Commerzbank’s MultiCash, booking and value data balances, cash pooling transactions and operational account transactions on all accounts included are made completely transparent at the click of a mouse. In addition, Commerzbank MultiCash functions as the ‘source’ for STP in SAP R/3. This has also enabled much of the routine work in accounting to be automated.</p>
<p>The data quality of individual accounts that could be viewed by calling up electronic account information also had an impact on the approach taken in the cash pooling project. An assessment of the current situation was made, which included looking into which entities in which countries could be included in the cash pool, and with which accounts. As a result of this assessment, ERCO and Commerzbank set priorities together and divided the project up into different implementation phases.</p>
<p>In a short space of time, either zero balancing or target balancing was put into place – depending on the business unit, with ERCO able to set the target balance individually where appropriate. “Ultimately, the solution enables us to increase our net cash flows, because liquidity can now be transferred same-day to where it is needed,” Müller-Ortolf adds. “This has brought great improvements in terms of the efficiency of our foreign exchange transactions and financial management as a whole.”</p>

<br/>
<br/>

<h2>Problem…</h2>
<p>A little over two years ago, OneMed kept a number of standalone bank accounts in a variety of countries and currencies, and with different banks. The company’s internal financing was sluggish, as it had to be channelled through internal loan contracts. Furthermore, the set-up was time-consuming for treasury staff, as each account had to be monitored individually to ensure it was either in credit or had not exceeded its overdraft limit.</p>
<p>“Our liquidity was scattered among different accounts in different countries, and was far from cost-effective,” says Jani Kivikari, Group Treasurer at OneMed.</p>
<p>This situation was a particular problem for OneMed as a large amount of cash was tied to these standalone accounts to maintain credit balances, and some of these accounts had overdraft facilities that were being used sub-optimally. The previous structure, with its myriad standalone accounts in foreign currencies, also posed a foreign exchange risk to OneMed. In addition to hindering the group’s internal financing, the old structure did not promote accurate cash forecasting among OneMed’s entities.</p>
<p>The company needed a solution which would enable it to manage a single bank account or a single cash pool. “As our name suggests, OneMed aspires to be as centralised as possible in its operations. This is also true in our banking relations – we wanted to have as close to one bank account as possible,” adds Kivikari.</p>


<h2>…Solved</h2>
<p>OneMed was able to address its issue with multiple local standalone accounts by implementing Global Cash Pool in spring 2012. Global Cash Pool is Nordea’s balance netting solution for real-time cross-border, cross-currency cash pooling. The solution replaces local cash pools and standalone accounts, and allows real-time concentration of liquidity throughout the company.</p>
<p>“Global Cash Pool’s master account gives us complete visibility of our cash position across our Nordic companies,” says Kivikari. “We still have legal bank accounts for individual currencies, but effectively we only need to monitor a single account, which has simplified the process no end.”</p>
<p>The solution, which is available to corporates with accounts in all major currencies in Nordic countries, Germany and the UK, allows treasuries to ensure there are no value day losses from internal transfers within the cash pool. It also maximises net interest, while minimising short-term financing costs.</p>
<p>“Global Cash Pool is so straightforward and intuitive to use, you hardly realise you are using it at all,” says Kivikari. “Combining our cash balances with the solution has freed up a significant volume of cash, and centralising our overdrafts has cut down on interest costs.”</p>
<p>Implementing the solution has also saved OneMed’s treasury time by reducing the administrative burden of its previous structure.</p>
<p>Reporting on Global Cash Pool is customisable, allowing users, for example, to view group accounts by currency or entity, with middle layers for reporting individual cash balances. Internal credit terms and conditions can be adapted to reflect a corporate’s transfer pricing policy.</p>
<p>In addition to these benefits, Global Cash Pool has also helped with OneMed’s cash forecasting. By combining the group’s bank accounts into a single cash pool, the solution aligns the interests of OneMed’s entities – if one entity is out of cash, all the entities are out of cash. “Now we are all in the same boat; our operating companies are much more motivated to provide timely and accurate cash flow forecasts as they are now directly impacted by the group’s net cash position,” says Kivikari. He says that as a result of implementing Nordea’s solution, the deviation between forecasted and actual entity account balances has dramatically reduced.</p>
<p>Kivikari believes Global Cash Pool has not only improved the group’s liquidity position, but has also fostered a spirit of collaboration with its operating companies. “In addition to releasing liquidity and cleaning up our account structure, Global Cash Pool has encouraged teamwork in our forecasting and efficiency in the use of short-term financing. It has shifted control of liquidity management to the group treasury and empowered our operating entities by giving them more time to focus on where they can really add value,” he says.</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>When Swiss packaging glass manufacturer Vetropack uncovered a number of holes in its payment reference database, the company knew it needed a reliable and comprehensive reference data solution that could integrate with its existing SAPTM system. SWIFTRef was the obvious choice.</p>
<p>Vetropack is one of Europe’s leading manufacturers of packaging glass for the beverages and food industry with a turnover of CHF620m and is a market leader in its six home markets of Switzerland, Austria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia and Ukraine.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>Four years ago, Vetropack launched a project to consolidate its separate SAPTM databases into one system, with maintenance centralised at a single site. The aim of the project was to replace Vetropack’s old IT environment and unify the group on an enterprise resource planning level. However, when it came to migrating Vetropack’s existing payments data onto the new system, the company soon realised that this data was of very poor quality.</p>
<p>Vetropack had previously relied on its suppliers to provide updates to their payment details, but most suppliers did not systematically inform the company of any changes. As a result, Vetropack was lacking vital reference data, including up-to-date Bank Identification Codes (BICs) and national bank sort codes. With 75% of the company’s 7,000 suppliers being in the SEPA zone, the company also had a significant need for accurate SEPA/IBAN reference data and validation tools, which were missing from its existing set-up.</p>
<p>This lack of accurate reference data produced a number of undesirable consequences. Of the circa 4,000 payments being made to suppliers each month, many were often delayed. This not only compromised the company’s reputation, but also led to undesirable bank charges for failed payments. Moreover, retrieving missing reference data was time-consuming. Vetropack’s accounts payable team would search the internet, using free – but ‘unofficial’ tools and sources – to look for the data they needed. “It was a very hit and miss process,” says Rolf Lehmann, Group Treasurer at Vetropack.</p>
<p>“There was a lot of erroneous data in our system. We had outdated SWIFT codes and national IDs, which led to payments being returned. As a result of these returned payments we lost out on early payment discounts amounting to circa €30,000 each month. That was a significant financial risk,” continues Lehmann.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>Fortunately, Vetropack was able to remedy its payment data challenge with the implementation of SWIFTRef in April 2013. SWIFTRef is a global reference data utility, provided and managed by SWIFT, which provides reference data and financial information to allow accurate payments processing, regulatory reporting and due diligence.</p>
<p>Vetropack’s reasons for choosing SWIFTRef were simple: “Having a solution that was fully SAPTM compatible was very important to us. With SWIFTRef there was no additional interface necessary, the upload to SAPTM worked first time, and the regular updates have continued to run problem-free. The competitive price was also a crucial factor in our decision,” explains Lehmann.</p>
<p>There are different SWIFTRef packages available to corporates, each with varying levels of coverage. Vetropack opted for a corporate package, which comprises all the directories and data necessary for frequent international and SEPA payments – and includes SWIFT’s ‘IBAN Plus’ file. This directory, which Vetropack integrated seamlessly into its SAPTM system, allows the company to prepare and validate payment messages to all IBAN countries, including the 33 SEPA countries. It also enables Vetropack to derive a BIC from an IBAN, in line with EU regulation 260/2012.</p>
<p>SWIFT’s online web query tool, Bankers World Online (BWO), is an additional benefit of Vetropack’s chosen SWIFTRef package. BWO provides direct access to all the worldwide payments reference data available in the SWIFTRef utility. It also holds standard settlement instructions, bank holiday information, currency codes, bank financials, credit ratings and ownership – and everything is updated daily.</p>
<p>“SWIFTRef ticks all the boxes for us,” comments Lehmann. “It gives us quick and easy access to the important data, all in a single source, and as it is provided by SWIFT, we know it is always accurate and up-to-date. What’s more, it is compatible with our SAPTM system. You can’t say fairer than that.”</p>
<p>Contrary to common perception, it is not necessary to be a direct corporate user of the SWIFT network to take advantage of SWIFT’s reference data suite. Indeed, Vetropack is not connected to the SWIFT network, but has still been able to benefit from SWIFTRef’s high-quality reference data, allowing the company to issue timely and accurate payment instructions.</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p>Holmes Place Lifestyle Clubs found that getting in shape for the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) posed a number of challenges. But with the expert advice provided by its banking partner, Commerzbank, the company was able to overcome these hurdles and successfully migrate its direct debits well in advance of the 1<sup>st</sup> February 2014 deadline. Now the business is no longer worried about compliance and is ready to leverage the benefits of a harmonised euro payments area.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>The company’s treasury teams were aware of the numerous benefits switching to SEPA would bring, such as centralising collections and, possibly, reducing bank fees in the future. However, with direct debits collected from 300,000 members in over 75 locations, much of the company’s post-deadline business hinged on how successfully the team managed the transition.</p>
<p>In September 2012, the company began its migration to SEPA. Immediately it was confronted with a number of challenges. Firstly, the company had decided to synchronise its switch to SEPA with the implementation of a new customer relationship management (CRM) system. But in order to migrate to SEPA, every existing database file had to be converted and validated, a task which involved obtaining International Bank Account Numbers (IBANs) and Bank Identifier Codes (BICs) from every customer.</p>
<p>A further problem arose when the company looked at the implications of the SEPA regulation’s pre-notification requirements. Under the new regulation, it is mandatory for pre-notifications for direct debits to be sent five additional days in advance. Switching to the new schedule, however, could potentially cause serious disruption concerning the company’s cash flow management, which depends on the direct debits received from their members in the first two days of the month.</p>
<p>“We needed a practical solution to this,” says Cees-Jan Dijkstra, CFO of Holmes Place Lifestyle Clubs, further explaining that sending out reminder letters each month would not likely be appreciated by their customers, not to mention the considerable costs that the company would incur through such an exercise.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>Fortunately for Holmes Place Lifestyle Clubs, specialist help was on hand. From the beginning, the firm was able to rely on the help and advice of two SEPA experts provided by its banking partner Commerzbank.</p>
<p>“At the outset we held several meetings with the specialists to discuss how the SEPA guidelines were to be interpreted and how we could find a feasible solution for both sides,” says Dijkstra. As the project proceeded, the company found Commerzbank’s SEPA experts were there to assist at every juncture. “Later on we set up a hotline to the professionals so that any problems that arose could be solved in a timely manner.”</p>
<p>In particular, Commerzbank helped convert customer master data into IBAN and BIC for a total of nine countries. This data was then validated, with Commerzbank helping the company by checking business partner master data against the bank’s account. Additionally, the bank also provided some assistance with its conversion service for SEPA Direct Debits (SDDs) and by informing direct debit initiators.</p>
<p>Like many corporates, Holmes Place Lifestyle Clubs found one of the biggest challenges relating to migration was interpreting the vast amounts of pages comprising the regulation. For this reason, the advice provided by Commerzbank proved critical, particularly in the case of pre-notifications for SDDs. When the company realised that migrating to SEPA would mean a longer pre-notification period, Commerzbank recommended that they set up a system of three workflows that trigger pre-notifications and SDD files. Through this solution SDDs now arrive in the bank account at the beginning of each month – exactly when they are needed.</p>
<p>Now the Holmes Place Lifestyle Clubs is SEPA-ready and, while many of its peers are scrambling to meet the deadline, the company can now look to how it will leverage the benefits of SEPA in the future. Top of the company’s agenda will be to reduce the number of collection banks by utilising SDD for cross-border transactions. “This will create added transparency and more streamlined payment methods for our members,” says Dijkstra. “It will also hopefully reduce our bank fees too, even if not by a large amount.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Cash-rich but affected by major seasonal swings in cash flow,  premium hair-care brand, Good Hair Day (ghd), found the answer in Barclays’ supplier finance solution.  Maximising assets has never looked so good!</p>

<h4 class=""fn"">James Taylor</h4>
<h5 class=""title"">Director of Finance</h5>
<img alt=""Good Hair Day (ghd)"" class=""logo org"" height=""33"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/ghd-logo-2013-90x33.png"" width=""90""/>
<p>Good Hair Day, popularly known as ghd, is a UK-based premium hair care brand. Launched in 2001, the company has built up a range of styling products which are sold across 14 countries globally, mainly through salons.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>Sales of Good Hair Day (ghd) products are seasonal, peaking in Q4 as the group capitalises on the Christmas gifting market. Although generally a cash-rich company, this seasonality has some clear working capital implications. The lead time on manufacturing, for example, means that Q4 production is ordered in May. Manufacturing takes place in China over the summer and the goods are shipped to the UK for distribution to salons in October. While the salons are on normal credit terms, with payment due at the end of the year, the European and US-owned manufacturers require settlement ex-works. This creates a funding gap, requiring ghd to hold more cash on its balance sheet than it might normally do. To maximise shareholder value, ghd wanted to release that cash to the business.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>“Our Barclays relationship director introduced us to the bank’s supplier finance product,” says James Taylor, Director of Finance at ghd. As lead bank in the firm’s lending syndicate, Barclays was very familiar with ghd’s business and had taken the time to understand its working capital cycle, he recalls. “As a cash-generative business our assets were never truly maximised and Barclays was keen to help us achieve that.”</p>
<p>Despite some initial reservations, ghd quickly saw the benefits of supplier finance. “One of the key advantages is that it is off-balance sheet and outside the current loan documents so it is not caught under any debt finance rules,” Taylor explains. This means that it does not impact lines of credit. Clearly this requires ghd to have a robust balance sheet and credit terms with Barclays, and it also required the other banks in ghd’s syndicate to assess the viability of the solution.</p>
<p>The intention was for ghd to use this solution with a limited number of trusted partners, initially approaching just two major suppliers. For an overseas business with limited access to low-cost debt, this solution can be “extremely advantageous”, notes Taylor.</p>
<p>Because ghd settles invoices with the bank, the interest rate available to suppliers is based on ghd’s credit rating with Barclays. This means that, although an overseas supplier with tight margins will have more risk around its credit terms, they can draw down the cash in the system with “extremely competitive” UK interest rates.</p>
<p>The other clear benefit to suppliers is control of the draw down process and therefore the cost to their business. Invoices are approved immediately by ghd and on the system suppliers can draw down funds right up to the due date. As a result, the supplier using the facility found it a useful means of managing its own cash flow, Taylor reports.</p>
<p>In operation, supplier finance has proven to be “very user-friendly”. It has also created an immediate uplift of ghd’s cash balance, adding 60 days to its working capital cycle and enabling the firm to be a lot more efficient with its cash. For Taylor, optimisation of assets is the main corporate advantage but there are also practical instances where supplier finance has proven its worth. It is, he notes, “a useful tool in any negotiation with the supplier; if they don’t want to move on price we may be able to move on credit terms.”</p>
<p>With the solution working “extremely well” from the outset for all parties, Taylor is now looking to extend it to more suppliers. And whilst he will be “cherry-picking” the ones he feels are most likely to benefit, he is clear that ghd will be working collaboratively with its suppliers and Barclays to build on the success of its current supplier finance proposition.</p>

"Problem Solved: Kirit Patel, Day Lewis","




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>For Day Lewis Group, affordable credit was in short supply following the financial crisis. Fortunately, a supply chain finance (SCF) solution delivered by Citi allowed the pharmaceutical retailer to secure the funding it needed to grow its business.</p>

<h4 class=""fn"">Kirit Patel</h4>
<h5 class=""title"">CEO</h5>
<img alt=""Day Lewis"" class=""logo org"" height=""43"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/day-lewis-logo-2013-45x43.png"" width=""45""/>
<p>Day Lewis Group is the UK’s largest independent pharmacy chain owning and managing over 200 pharmacies across the country. These outlets are predominantly based in local community and secondary high street locations. Throughout its 38-year history, Day Lewis has been developing from a traditional retail pharmacy business into a patient-orientated service provider, dispensing pharmaceutical and other retail products, providing a diverse range of clinical services to its customers.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>Day Lewis needed capital in order to expand its store base. As a supplier of pharmaceutical products to the NHS, the company joined a supply chain finance (SCF) scheme provided by Citi which allowed it to unlock credit and boost its working capital at a much lower cost.</p>
<p>Day Lewis has over 205 pharmaceutical outlets in the UK, each providing prescription medicines to NHS patients. The company then invoices the Department of Health (DoH) which reimburses the company on average 36 days later.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the credit crisis, Day Lewis’ banking partners imposed a working capital covenant on the business, presenting it with a significant challenge. Making internal improvements to its working capital management was not easy: one problem was that the NHS does not reimburse pharmacy the VAT paid by the contractors for customer prescriptions on time, obliging it to claim it back through a separate and lengthy accounting process with HM Customs and Excise.</p>
<p>Affordable bank finance might have provided the business with some respite, but with a lack of liquidity in the market place, the company found the cost of borrowing prohibitively expensive. The credit rating of its NHS debtor, because of the absence of documentary evidence, was not taken into account by the bank, making the interest rate payable much higher. Under these conditions, finding the required capital to follow through on its plans to open new stores and grow the business became increasingly challenging.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>Day Lewis considered selling its NHS debt to a third party, but found the rates on offer too steep to provide a sustainable solution to the problem. Then the company heard about the SCF solution provided by Citi on behalf of HM Government. Through this solution, Day Lewis secured cheap invoice finance based on the NHS’s credit rating. This meant Day Lewis not only received payment for its prescription invoices a month earlier, but the cost of borrowing was significantly cheaper than options explored previously.</p>
<p>Kirit Patel, the company’s CEO, admits he was surprised at how straightforward the process proved. Besides a few minor formalities concerning its syndicated borrowing facility, the company faced few legal obstacles to its participation in the scheme. As soon as Citi had spoken to the syndicated banks on Day Lewis’ behalf to explain the terms of the arrangement, the company was given the go-ahead.</p>
<p>“The only reservation I could think of at the time was that it seemed to be too good to be true,” Patel recalls. “But we investigated it and we had high-level meetings – and there was really no catch.” Following uptake of the Citi solution, the company’s balance sheet was transformed, almost overnight. In addition to a substantial saving of £200,000 in interest costs, Day Lewis was able to reduce its overdraft. In turn, it also received a sum of £6.5m back for capital expenditure.</p>
<p>That money will now be used to expand the Day Lewis store base. “We have freed up working capital and acquired capital expenditure to increase the number of shops,” says Patel. “It was a Downing Street scheme to free up working capital for capital expenditure. Now, that is exactly what we are going to be doing – spending more money on new stores and freeing up cash in the economy.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Türk Telekom wanted to improve the visibility, control and predictability of its cash flows. Citi developed an innovative solution that leveraged the bank’s partnership with Post Bank of Turkey (PTT), which has 4000 online branches countrywide, so that Türk Telekom treasury can see the amount in its accounts online, same day, as well as how much each office has deposited.</p>


<h4 class=""fn"">Tamer Karabulut</h4>
<h5 class=""title"">Head of Treasury Operations</h5>
<img alt=""Türk Telekom"" class=""logo org"" height=""43"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/turk-telekom-logo-2013-70x43.png"" width=""70""/>

<p>Türk Telekom Group, the leading communication and convergence technology group in Turkey, provides integrated telecommunication services from PSTN and GSM to broadband internet. As of 31<sup>st</sup> December 2012, Türk Telekom group companies have 14.3m fixed access lines, 7m broadband connections and 13.5m mobile subscribers. Group companies have a modern network infrastructure covering the whole country and offer a wide variety of services to residential and commercial customers all over Turkey.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>Türk Telekom has more than 300 offices countrywide, of which each collects cash from subscribers. The company’s main cash management challenge was to collect the funds from these offices and deposit them into the HQ current account. In the previous cash management set-up, there were three ways to collect cash: pick-up by armoured cars from 165 offices; deposit into an account held with a state-owned bank, for further transfer to the HQ account and direct debit from dealers. The first two collection methods were at the root of the problem, effectively having a negative effect on cash flow visibility, predictability and usage.</p>
<p>Firstly, the cost for armoured car collections was considerable and there was a growing dissatisfaction with the service level. There was also significant inefficiency built into this model in terms of working capital management because the cash was picked up from the offices daily at 5pm. Türk Telekom could not utilise the cash on the same day, which meant the company was sitting on an excess of idle cash.</p>
<p>Secondly, the company faced a delay when offices used the bank deposit method. “Our offices went to the state-owned bank and deposited cash into their accounts, and the bank then transferred the money to Türk Telekom’s HQ account,” says Tamer Karabulut, Head of Treasury Operations, Türk Telekom. Consequently, it would normally take one day for the amount to show up in the HQ account. In addition, Türk Telekom wasn’t able to determine the amount collected per unit each day. As a result, the treasury’s cash flow forecasts were not accurate.</p>
<p>Hence, the company decided to explore alternative collection channels to reduce costs and accelerate and improve the efficiency of the cash collection process.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>Türk Telekom reached out to its banking partners for a solution, but most came back with the same cash management structure, including armoured car collections – some offering a slightly lower price. However, the company was really looking for an innovative solution that would be preferable in terms of cost and efficiency. Citi was the only bank to come up with an innovative solution. The solution leverages Citibank A.S. Turkey’s partnership with Post Bank of Turkey (PTT), which has 4000 online branches countrywide, effectively the largest branch network in the country.</p>
<p>Citi’s corporate clients can benefit from cash deposit transactions. For Türk Telekom this was a particularly ideal solution as they share the same offices with PTT in many locations, as a result of being a business unit of PTT before being hived off as a separate company in 1995 and privatised in 2005. The physical proximity of the locations effectively eliminates the burden of moving cash and reduces the cash collection costs by nearly 20%.</p>
<p>In the PTT branches, with the custom designed Citi collection screens, offices can deposit cash until 5pm local time. Cash deposit transactions are performed in a straight through process (STP) on PTT teller screens. Identification details of the depositors are then saved in a database and this data is automatically displayed for future transactions, which makes the transaction entry process more efficient.</p>
<p>When a cash deposit is made, Türk Telekom treasury can see the amount in their accounts online, same day, as well as how much each office has deposited. “Because we can monitor all the cash inflows, we are now able to forecast the future,” says Karabulut. Implementation of the solution has had a positive impact on the cash collection process of Türk Telekom in terms of efficiency.</p>
<p>Türk Telekom can automate incomings reconciliation and increase efficiency thanks to a tailor-made reconciliation tool in which Citi combines a standard MT940 swift message with corresponding transaction codes of Türk Telekom. The project began in June 2011 and the first transaction was realised in November that year. Treasury set up the new process and informed their offices.</p>
<p>The company opted for a phased regional roll out and completed on-boarding all of the eligible offices by August 2012. Today, Türk Telekom is using Citi’s solution at 145 points through post offices countrywide. Monthly volume has reached TRY17m, with a total number of 2500 transactions. Citi is now looking at developing a solution for offices in locations that are not covered by PTT.</p>

"Problem Solved: Andreas Liebenow, Henkel","




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Henkel needed greater visibility and control over its entire banking structure and “wanted to see all balances of all accounts on a daily basis, at the press of a button”. The only solution was a web-based, bank-owned solution and Citi’s TreasuryVision liquidity portal stood out.</p>


<h4 class=""fn"">Andreas Liebenow</h4>
<h5 class=""title"">Treasury Processing Manager</h5>
<img alt=""Henkel"" class=""logo org"" height=""27"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/henkel-logo-2012-150x27.png"" width=""150""/>

<p>Henkel is a leading laundry and home care, beauty care and adhesive technologies company. The company, headquartered in Düsseldorf, Germany, was established in 1876. It now has subsidiaries in over 75 countries with more than 47,000 employees. Global sales of over €16.5 billion stretch across a portfolio including a number of global brands such as Persil, Schwarzkopf and Loctite.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>Henkel had more than 1000 bank accounts with over 140 banks around the world, many accumulated via acquisition. Although it had been using a single database (containing all account numbers, SWIFT codes and so on) to maintain accounts worldwide, it had no centralised bank account statement collection and no group-wide ERP. The onset of the financial crisis drove the company’s senior executives to seek a way of establishing greater visibility and control over Henkel’s entire banking structure. In essence, says Henkel’s Treasury Processing Manager, Andreas Liebenow, “we wanted to see all balances of all accounts on a daily basis, at the press of a button”. Given the economic environment, it also wanted this structure in place with minimal delay.</p>
<p>Having formed a requirements definition, Henkel’s project team studied the market closely for a solution. Although integration of balance reporting into the company’s existing SAP ERP and Wall Street Systems TMS would be the ultimate aim, it was deemed at the time to be an overly resource-intensive solution. Buying in a separate software solution would also require commitment to a major implementation effort, with considerable costs likely. The only other option was to deploy a web-based bank-owned solution.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>In this respect, one offering stood out: Citi’s TreasuryVision liquidity portal. “From the beginning we felt good with Citi,” states Liebenow. Henkel already had around 20% of its accounts with Citi but TreasuryVision, with full data warehousing and reporting functionality, would be taking in MT940 electronic account statements from all of the group’s banking partners. This solution had never been implemented in Germany before but it was live with more than 120 corporates globally. “We never once felt like we were the guinea pig,” states Liebenow.</p>
<p>With a dedicated and experienced Citi implementation manager and solid technical support in place, Henkel was provided with template forms and information packs to send, via all treasury locations, to each of its banks. The form requested daily MT940s from every account to be sent to Citi. With Liebenow supervising account feedback, TreasuryVision was tailored to fit Henkel’s data structure.</p>
<p>Within a couple of months, 80% of the group’s liquidity, representing the most important accounts, was visible within TreasuryVision. In the second wave, some ‘less-sophisticated’ third-party banks have been unable to submit MT940s in the correct format. With Citi’s support Henkel has either been working with them directly on a case-by-case basis to implement a work-around. In some cases Henkel finally opted to manually input their balance information into TreasuryVision. As new accounts are opened (and others are taken on through acquisition) all must be reportable via MT940. And with all local subsidiaries now paying to maintain multiple accounts, it ensures each is justified. Liebenow reports that almost 150 accounts have been either closed completely or moved to a bank that can accommodate MT940s. The total number of bank relationships has been reduced by 14.</p>
<p>“The most important benefit is that we now have liquidity status on a daily basis whenever we are asked,” notes Liebenow. “It does not matter if we are asked for a region or for a company or for the whole group; we have the answer.” This “positively completes the project”; anything else – such as improved counterparty risk management and faster response to industry and economic change – is a welcome add-on.</p>
<p>Henkel has implemented a rule of zero cash for its affiliates. Cash pools are kept in the regions with most liquidity – the biggest Asian countries, North America and Europe. It also requests a quarterly report on the use of guarantees and credit facilities. With greater control over all accounts, facilitated by TreasuryVision’s capacity to drill down into account data, funds retained by affiliates must also now be justified and checks can be made on their use. Improved head office oversight promotes the prudent use of funds, becoming almost a self-regulating process, Liebenow commenting that it has indeed “encouraged changes of behaviour”.</p>
<p>Plans are afoot to build an interface between TreasuryVision and the Wall Street Systems TMS to enable automated reconciliation of net financial debt and daily financial status reporting (currently manual processes). There is also a plan to integrate credit facility reporting. None of this would be possible without Henkel first having established implemented TreasuryVision. As Liebenow comments, “this is an excellent result so far and there is a lot of future potential”.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Among many of IATA’s initiatives for its members is its billing and settlement plan (BSP). This is a system administered worldwide that improves financial control and cash flow for airlines by simplifying the selling, reporting and remitting procedures for all IATA accredited ticketing agencies. At the close of 2011, there were 88 BSPs, covering 176 countries and territories, serving around 400 airlines. Gross sales processed amounted to $249 billion.</p>


<h4 class=""fn"">Dmitriy Shamraev</h4>

<img alt=""IATA"" class=""logo org"" height=""39"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/iata-logo-2013-60x39.png"" width=""60""/>

<p>Created over 60 years ago by a group of airlines, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) is now an international industry trade group with 60 offices worldwide covering more than 150 countries. It represents 240 of the world’s leading passenger and cargo airlines which together account for 84% of all air traffic. IATA’s focus is on making air transport safer, more secure, efficient and sustainable, both environmentally and economically.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>In Russia, the BSP connects more than 100 airlines and some 500 agents located across the country. Annual throughput exceeds RUB 81 billion ($2.56 billion). “The challenge was around the reconciliation of payments,” says Dmitriy Shamraev, IATA Director for Russia and CIS. The system must reconcile the billing from each airline with the payments received from the agents, and then reconcile these with the settlement files from IATA, the latter forming the basis of the settlement for the airlines.</p>
<p>The agency remittance cycle takes place three times a month, with IATA having responsibility to the airlines to process the funds as quickly and efficiently as possible, with same-day or next day settlements required. With a global remittance, reconciliation and settlement engine still being developed for IATA, the volumes being processed meant it was not possible to rely upon manual processing; this would have been labour intensive, costly and would potentially expose all parties to error and delay. IATA Russia needed an automated solution and called upon its banking partner, VTB Bank, to help.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>As IATA Russia’s domestic cash management bank, VTB Bank has sight of all the balances and fund movements of the airlines and agents. To be able to complete the loop, it required IATA Russia’s files for billing against which the reconciliations are made. Armed with this data, and in partnership with VTB Group’s own processing centre, the bank was able to develop a bespoke IT solution for the BSP payments reconciliation and streamlining the settlement process between all parties.</p>
<p>In practice, payments are automatically sorted using a unique IATA code and grouped into payment batches by beneficiary. The subsequent report from VTB Bank allows IATA Russia to see any shortfalls or surplus for each agent or airline and to track changes over time. Once the system has calculated the current balances for each participant and produced payment batches on behalf of IATA Russia, VTB Bank passes the data via its web-banking channel to IATA Russia for verification and approval by an authorised signatory. Payments are then executed by VTB Bank through the Russian domestic payment systems. The whole payment cycle is handled automatically with minimal manual intervention at any point.</p>
<p>This “unique and outstanding” solution from VTB Bank may have started tentatively with low volumes, but since going live with IATA Russia it has required nothing more than “a few fine tunings along the way” and has now been ramped up to cover all activity on the BSP. But this is only part of the story.</p>
<p>Because IATA Russia publishes an operating calendar for its remittance and payments cycle at least 12 months in advance, the huge amount of money that passes rapidly through the BSP account does so on a highly predictable cycle. With this understanding, VTB Bank has been able to deliver a short-term investment solution to enable IATA Russia to really get the most from the solution. As the funds that pass through ultimately belong to the airlines, the investment revenue that is generated is used to reduce the cost of their participation in the BSP system, further adding value for participants.</p>
<p>Shamraev remains enthusiastic about VTB Bank’s input to date. Having chosen the bank in part for its “flexibility”, and it having delivered and maintained the BSP project in impressive style, he says he is “really looking forward to building the partnership into something bigger”. One element of that strategic relationship already in development will use VTB Bank’s internet banking channel to enable “more flexibility” for IATA’s signatories, giving them the option to authorise settlement whilst on the move. This solution is nearing completion; given the highly mobile nature of IATA’s management team and the success of VTB Bank to date, Shamraev naturally hopes delivery will be “as soon as possible”.</p>

<p>A cash management solution from Citi enabled InterContinental Hotels Group to implement a cross-border notional pooling structure helping its subsidiaries to maintain optimal levels of working capital.</p>

<p>InterContinental Hotels Group plc (IHG) operates in nearly 100 countries around the world. It owns nine hotel brands including InterContinental, Crowne Plaza and Holiday Inn. As of June 2012 it had a worldwide portfolio of 4,542 hotels, with a global development pipeline of 1,060 hotels. In 2011, its total gross revenue was $20.2 billion (up 8% on the previous year).</p>
<p>IHG operates hotels in three ways: as a franchisor, a manager, and on an owned and leased basis. Franchising is the largest part of IHG’s business with 3,886 hotels under such agreement. Worldwide it manages 646 hotels and owns ten.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>A few years back, IHG sold most of its hotels to enable it to adopt a new franchise model. In Europe, this heralded an RFP for cash management, which included two cash pools – one in euro, one in US dollar. Previously, ad hoc transfers were only being sent on a weekly basis and there was a keen sense that IHG’s cash was not working as hard as it could. Group treasury, based in Burton-on-Trent, did not have access to the whole value, just the cash sent by each subsidiary, and liquidity management could not be overseen centrally.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>With Citi (which already had IHG’s AR business) winning the deal, the new structure fell into place, enabling IHG to rationalise bank accounts and increase its subsidiaries’ access to liquidity throughout Europe. “From this point on, the two single notional currency pools expanded”, says Bert Heirbaut, Treasury Manager at IHG. “The next step for us was to include the Asia Pacific entities.”</p>
<p>IHG then decided to implement a multicurrency cross-border notional pooling structure with a two-way same-value automated sweep. Both bank and client reviewed the Citibank pooling functionality against the IHG requirements until an efficient solution was created. Initially it covered 24 IHG subsidiaries in ten jurisdictions, with 36 bank accounts spread all over the world.</p>
<p>In practice, during the working day, local IHG finance teams included in the pooling have a credit bank balance available in their local in-country accounts for accounts payable and payroll purposes. If appropriate, local accounts also collect management and franchise fees from local hotel owners.</p>
<p>At the end of each day, any surplus currency balances are swept into mirror accounts in London. These currency balances – in Australian, Hong Kong, Singapore and US dollars, Swiss franc, Czech krone, euro, Polish zloty, and Hungarian forint – are converted into a notional US dollar balance. In time for the next working day, each local currency is swept back out to the respective local banks. “It’s all around the timing,” explains Bert, IHG adopting an “against the sun” automated sweep model where funds are collected and returned according to time zone. He reports no issues with Citi’s timing.</p>
<p>From a subsidiary perspective, the structure means cash flow requests are now less frequent and they have more optimum levels of working capital in their local bank accounts. In the US, where the bulk of IHG’s franchise estate resides, significant cash volume is paid in daily which is currently invested in cash funds locally. The notional cash pool enables IHG to consider centralising all liquidity management within group treasury.</p>
<p>The project, delivered at a one off cost of $20,000, also currently enables more than 80% of the management fees and franchise fees collected in EMEA, across 16 subsidiaries, to be made available to group treasury by the end of the same day, allowing it to repay bank debt saving around $50,000 per year in bank interest charges. By amalgamating two pools into one for IHG, Citi has also saved its client annual bank charges of $100,000 a year. In addition, the $5m of idle cash sitting in the subsidiaries’ local bank accounts has been reduced to zero: “There is no idle cash at all in IHG’s subsidiaries partaking in the notional pool,” states Bert.</p>
<p>In purely practical terms, group treasury has not only improved working capital at group level but can now also view cash globally on a daily basis, providing its subsidiaries with more flexibility by allowing higher cash balances in their local currencies during the working day.</p>
<p>But IHG and Citi’s work is not done yet. There are more subsidiaries to add: whilst Canadian dollar and Mexican peso accounts have already been added as a one-way manual sweep into London, others will remain manual contributors until cash levels reach a value that warrants inclusion in the sweeping mechanism. Saving the best until last, Bert says IHG is working with Citi on an option to include RMB. Currently, Chinese hotels pay management fees in RMB into Hong Kong. Whilst volumes are modest, the expectation is that by 2025 China’s hotel market will be the same size as the US, bringing considerably more volume – IHG wants daily access to those funds. This, says Bert, is all part of IHG’s financial “future-proofing plan”.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>In order to achieve a bespoke card solution to fit Lundbeck, ING first focused on understanding the company’s needs: control and compliance of payments, management efficiency, and a reduction of travel expenses.</p>


<h4 class=""fn"">Cécile Jouclas</h4>
<h5 class=""title"">Chief Accountant</h5>
<img alt=""Lundbeck"" class=""logo org"" height=""36"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/lundbeck-logo-2012-90x36.png"" width=""90""/>

<p>Founded by Hans Lundbeck as a trading company in 1915, Lundbeck is now an international pharmaceutical company working with brain disorders. One of Denmark’s most research-intensive enterprises, Lundbeck currently employs 6,000 people across 57 countries and generated revenue of approximately DKK16 billion (€1.97 billion) in 2011.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>Lundbeck’s French affiliate was quite content with the corporate card arrangement that they had held with a local French bank for over a decade, but headquarters was unfamiliar with this financial institution. This invariably led to queries and questions around certain banking approaches the French bank took that were not aligned with the group’s house bank, ING, according to Cécile Jouclas, Chief Accountant at Lundbeck. “Overall, we felt that it might be easier to work with the same bank as our group. We already had quite a satisfactory solution with our existing domestic bank but we were looking to align our banking partners with that of the rest of the company.”</p>
<p>There was no need for an RFP (request for proposal): as Lundbeck’s house bank, ING was the obvious choice. Instead, it was more a matter of finding out in what ways ING could offer the same services and functions that the French bank had provided. “In particular, the replacement bank would need to offer an equivalent expense control solution to what we already had,” says Jouclas. For example, as a pharmaceutical company, many people who have a genuine need for a credit card on a daily basis (business expenses) are on the company’s payroll. Jouclas, therefore, was looking for a solution/service that would enable those employees to continue to operate their daily functions in the manner that they had been while retaining simplicity for the back office with regards to reconciliation, control and monitoring.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>Although under no obligation to change banks by group headquarters, Jouclas recognised the benefits that could be garnered from a more uniform banking relationship across the entire company: economies of scale, attractive pricing and full company cash visibility being just a few incentives. However, before making the leap, the French entity was determined to ensure that they were working with a team that they could trust. “When we first met with the ING team and they presented us with their solution, we were won over by their professional approach,” says Jouclas. “Prior to the changeover, we were assured that ING understood the organisation of Lundbeck, where we fit into that structure, what we needed and so on. They also guaranteed that the implementation would be uncomplicated for us – we wouldn’t have changed banks otherwise.”</p>
<p>In order to achieve a bespoke solution to fit Lundbeck, ING first focused on understanding the company’s needs: control and compliance of payments, management efficiency, and a reduction of travel expenses where possible. The bank proposed a card solution that has features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Spending caps tailored to the company’s travel policy for individuals, by department, or across the company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sophisticated online tools – ING Corporate Card Online and MasterCard smartdata.gen2 – for automated and intelligent management of business travel expenses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A corporate card scheme accepted by more than 30m locations worldwide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various corporate card programmes with individual pay and company pay including payment terms from 28 – 60 days.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout the implementation, Lundbeck and ING discussed the progress on a weekly basis – consultations that ranged from as short as five minutes to several hours – until a satisfactory resolution was reached. This approach allowed both parties to bring up and solve challenges and to align on the current status and next steps. The standard of service that ING offers is impeccable, according to Jouclas. “This high level of communication is very beneficial to the company as a whole and a constant comfort for us as we are new to the relationship.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, ING has recently presented Jouclas’ department with the concept of SMS alert, the implementation of which would allow employees to know a few days in advance how much will be debited from their bank account. Says Jouclas: “I am very pleased to have worked with the experts on the ING team and we look forward to working with them in the future.” The ING commercial card solution product line enables centralised and decentralised organisations to standardise and simplify expenditures made by its employees. At the same time this solution enhances the financial supply chain, increases the overall control and minimises costs and fraud risks.</p>

Problem Solved: Huawei,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Huawei’s business has rapidly expanded internationally over the last decade, not only in terms of volume, but also in the number of countries and currencies they deal with.  This growth created the need for Huawei to become a more globally integrated company.</p>

<img alt=""Huawei"" class=""logo org"" height=""40"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/huawei-logo-2012-40x40.png"" width=""40""/>
<p>Established in 1987, Huawei has already achieved significant success as a leading telecom solutions provider. Originally a very small company, Huawei now supplies top-quality products and solutions in over 140 countries, serving more than one third of the world’s population. In spite of the global economic difficulties in the last year, Huawei recruited net profits amounted to CNY 11.6 billion for 2011.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>Due to the current market uncertainty and increased business volumes internally, the company realised that it needed to improve control, efficiency and transparency.</p>
<p>This changing economic landscape persuaded Huawei to transform its organisation and processes, especially in the areas of liquidity and risk management. The treasury department wished to find more efficient and creative ways to monitor its cash and fund the business expansion in a secure and controlled manner. Meeting these challenges required a solution that could not only handle the current business, but could also position the company to handle future challenges and opportunities as well.</p>
<p>Like many other corporations post-2008, Huawei maintained higher cash reserves to mitigate any volatile market changes. The company keeps an appropriate level of cash to meet day-to-day operational needs but primarily looks to deploy surplus cash to fund research and development (R&amp;D) and business growth. Recognising the need to completely transform its treasury – and seeing that the current processes and systems would eventually anchor the company down – the decision was made to spend the time, resources and cash on a treasury management system (TMS) that has the capacity to handle its growing international complexity for the next 20 years.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>Huawei’s transformation included the entire treasury, from balance sheet management down to cash management. Areas including capital structure, balance sheet planning, working capital, credit risk, sales financing, bank relations, trade financing and cash management were addressed in this transformation. Each process was documented, charted and then benchmarked against industry best practices. The project team spent almost as much time on understanding and documenting the business requirements as on the implementation itself, taking care to convey these requirements to the vendor clearly, concisely and with proper detail.</p>
<p>Part of Huawei’s ongoing transformation is to give the middle office more power to perform operational decision making, approvals and oversight that was previously performed by the treasurer. The company also partnered with niche banks to help manage its multi-currency notional pool. The last step for Huawei was to identify the TMS that best met all of its requirements as outlined above. Performing a side-by-side comparison of multiple systems and identifying the gaps between the various third-party treasury systems and the necessary requirements, the company realised that SunGard AvantGard Quantum best met its needs.</p>
<p>Previously, the accounting had been managed at the enterprise level but Huawei learned that the TMS is as much an accounting system as it is a treasury system. Today, the treasury accountants are responsible for the TMS sub-ledger and are partnered with the treasury business to understand and manage the treasury centre financials more effectively.</p>
<p>Obtaining buy-in from the top is a critical success factor for any company embarking on such a project which is why a clear business case is so important. To obtain the guidance and support of its board, Huawei had to point out plainly the importance, necessity, benefits and risk associated with taking no action. Indeed, Huawei found high value in examining case studies of other corporations outside of the technology industry. Case studies not only helped the company build its business case, but also provided valuable lessons learned from those with recent treasury transformation experience. Huawei were then able to verify its sizing, improve its project planning, and set more realistic expectations.</p>
<p>There really is no ‘end result’ of Huawei’s transformation as the company has only taken the first step, intending to continuously and relentlessly optimise. This transformation supports Huawei’s vision of having a global treasury integrated within Huawei, allowing the treasury to proactively support the company goals. There is an old Chinese saying that illustrates this well, ‘the journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step’.</p>

<p>Business travel underpins the success of any multinational company. Meetings have to be attended. Deals need to be negotiated. And new markets have to be opened. As a result, airline tickets, car rentals and hotel rooms must be provided for employees.</p>

<img alt=""Electrolux logo"" class=""logo"" height=""15"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/electrolux-logo-2012-120x15.png"" width=""120""/>

<p>Electrolux is a global manufacturer of household and professional appliances. The company, founded in 1919, sells more than 40m products in over 150 countries annually. With 58,000 employees across the globe, Electrolux has taken active efforts to expand in growth markets. In particular it is experiencing strong growth in its Asian and Latin American regions. Electrolux had sales of SEK102 billion in 2011.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>An effective charge card system that has wide coverage, control and management information capabilities is essential for business travel, according to Jo Hamburger, Global Commodity Director Mobility and Facility at Electrolux. “We always had a consistent card programme in place since the mid-1990s,” says Hamburger. “It was homogenous and worked in more than 40 countries. But after 15 years with another major card services provider, we wanted to see if there was another player on the market. We were looking for a global solution that provided more coverage and management information.”</p>
<p>Some multinationals might settle for a charge card system that operates in ten or 15 strategic locations. Not Electrolux however. As a global business, it needed a global solution. It was imperative that employees’ charge cards worked wherever the company operated. Electrolux’s previous card programme had some issues. There were difficulties of acceptance in Europe including central and eastern European countries; and it was troubled by banking licence problems in Italy. On one occasion Electrolux couldn’t issue new cards for a period of months, causing needless turmoil in the organisation. Hamburger was keen to solve these complications. With a new card programme, perhaps it was possible to extend the company’s horizons? Citi’s team took on the assignment in March 2011.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>Implementing a global solution is a difficult task. But completing it within a tight deadline is an even tougher one. Electrolux required a solution that was flexible, agile and speedy. Citi had just a matter of months to pull off the project. “What we really needed was a consistent card programme in more than 45 countries,” says Hamburger. “I stress the word ‘consistent’. Electrolux does not prefer one country over the other; we needed global reach for our charge cards.”</p>
<p>Given the sheer scale of the project, there were time pressures for both Citi and Electrolux. In certain markets, Citi had to rely on Electrolux’s previous experience in order to facilitate the implementation process. But as time progressed and by working closely together, Citi and Electrolux formed a robust project plan and strategy as well as strong communication channels. Hamburger’s team of three people had daily contact with Citi throughout the implementation period. “We could call several times a day with questions, remarks and suggestions about everything,” says Hamburger. “And these were often very specific questions with regards to the solution.”</p>
<p>The new card programme was rolled out in all markets in October 2011. After a meeting with senior management at Citi in London, weekly update calls were set up to discuss new opportunities and tackle future challenges. “Citi offered a card programme that was more consistent in terms of coverage, effective management and control,” says Hamburger. “This allowed us to know exactly what our employees are doing and spending while travelling on business trips.” Another major benefit of Citi’s card programme was that it could be expanded to every employee at the company. The previous charge card scheme took into account individuals’ credit history. This often meant excluding employees with a bad credit record. The new card solution works under the umbrella of a business relationship between Citi and Electrolux. So the liability is now a corporate one. Electrolux guarantees the payment; not the individual. As a result, today every Electrolux employee has a charge card for business travel.</p>
<p>Electrolux has seen greater acceptance of its card programme – particularly in Eastern Europe and Latin America. The latter region is an important growth market for the appliance manufacturer. And banking licence issues in Italy are now a thing of the past. For a business that has operations across the world, there will always be countries that are trouble spots. And it is a process that Citi is continually improving. Since the October launch its team has introduced new management information platforms, as well as brought new countries on board the card programme. “With Citi the new solution provides wider issuing opportunities and greater coverage through acceptance, which provides greater control,” says Hamburger. “So we are able to steer the programme in a better way. And that is the main point.”</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>In the first six months of its 2012 financial year, the Würth Group generated sales of €5 billion as a major player in the assembly and fastening materials business. Its product range covers both craft and industry and comprises over 100,000 products including screws, screw accessories, anchors, tools, chemical-technical products and personal protection equipment. The family-run business based in Germany and Switzerland consists of more than 400 companies located in over 80 countries, employing in excess of 65,000 people. It has more than 3m customers worldwide.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>The first problem was in supplying the correct BIC and IBAN codes for its master data file of vendors and customers. The BIC codes were filled in manually because the company could not find a cost-effective and easily implementable electronic directory to integrate with its systems.</p>
<p>Secondly, Würth’s SWIFT account statements (MT940s) are processed electronically in its SAP ERP system. This involves an average of 13,000 payment receipts per day. Although around 90% of all bookings are fully automated, all exceptions must be manually input. The next problem then is that as the number of payments using the SEPA format increases, the straight through processing (STP) rate is dropping. This is due to the fact that, alongside MT940s, Würth also uses summary bank reports in local bank data (for Germany ‘DTI’) to process its payment receipts.</p>
<p>At present, some banks do not provide SEPA payment receipts in these summaries. As the German DTI format does not display the whole content of the SCT, Würth does not have the luxury of processing SEPA payment receipts automatically. The SEPA equivalent to these summaries in local formats is a separate file, submitted in the ISO 20022 XML format (CAMT). This is all compounded by the uncertainty around the European Commission’s intention to impose a mandatory conversion date for account statements for corporates (in Article 5 for XML extracts covering SEPA cash management messages). Corporates are mandated to switch to XML by 1<sup>st</sup> February 2014.</p>
<p>Würth needed to be ready for every eventuality, but with the number of messages received increasing, the lack of clarity around message format was a serious issue. Should the company set up its multiple bank accounts for XML? And if so, how will it integrate messages in its ERP system? These were among the questions posed to Commerzbank.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>“We have a strong partnership between Commerzbank and our company,” says Claus Wild, Project Manager SAP Financial – Payments and Cash Management at Würth. It is this bond with its banking partner that has helped Würth to find a solution for these two payments issues.</p>
<p>Firstly Commerzbank provides its corporate customers with a SWIFT BIC directory on a regular basis. This enables Würth to obtain the right data for its cross-border payments, including SCTs. “We get all the BICs we need and now there is the opportunity in SAP to fully automate the process,” says Wild. “It takes only a few minutes to update all the necessary information.” Wild is surprised that Commerzbank’s specific SWIFT BIC service is not known more widely in the corporate community. “You get the BIC file with electronic access into the Commerzbank Corporate Banking Portal. An updated version of the download file is available every two months,” he adds.</p>
<p>Würth is also making preparations to receive CAMT format messages, collected by Commerzbank and processed in SAP. At this point, the solution is still a work in progress, with Würth, Commerzbank and SAP working towards the test phase, the implementation having been completed. The solution, once it goes live (possibly summer/autumn 2012) will see Würth as its first ever user. “When it works, we will have solved this problem for all European companies which use SAP,” says Wild.</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>DA-Desk is the largest independent provider of port cost management services to the shipping industry. Founded in 2001, the company addresses an important need in the whole shipping industry; each time a shipping company docks a vessel, it must transfer funds in advance to a port agent for payment of voyage-related costs. DA-Desk has established a global financial platform that facilitates these payment transactions between the two parties. This set of services is known as PortPayables and was established in 2004.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>“The business logic behind this service is highly persuasive,” says Domenico Carlucci, Financial Services Director at DA-Desk. “Because we handle such a large volume, PortPayables is able to negotiate improved conditions per individual payment and to ensure a timely delivery of the funds to the beneficiaries.” In 2011, PortPayables transferred several billion dollars in payments for its shipping clients to the appointed port agents and is expected to continue this growth trajectory and double the volume of operations in the next three years.</p>
<p>Historically, the US dollar has been the backbone of the shipping industry in terms of the payment of freight; however port charges are originally borne in local currencies. Industry stakeholders are therefore exposed to FX risk every time a payment in US dollars is converted. DA-Desk’s services have proved to be a huge success. By 2010 it found that it could use the business’s scale to further enhance value for customers through improving their banking terms. In order to do this DA-Desk needed three things: an electronic banking platform that allowed the initiation and execution of payments in a single operation; a superior service quality offered by its banking services provider; and a timely and secure execution of the payment to the beneficiary, fully compliant in all respects. This last point was extremely important: if DA-Desk missed a payment for its client, the shipping vessel could be arrested and the vessel operating company could lose $40,000-50,000 each day. “In our industry, time really is money and we are proud none of our client’s vessel has ever been arrested, due to delayed payment execution,” says Kalyan Raman, PortPayables Manager at DA-Desk.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>“We needed a bank that had a large footprint everywhere in the world. It had to have a great platform to execute payments on time and an ability to deal with exotic currencies, such as the Brazilian real, Russian rouble, Chinese renminbi and Colombian peso – which are all very important in the industry,” says Carlucci.</p>
<p>After a tender to several major banks in mid-2011, Citi was chosen as the current DA-Desk’s new financial counterparty. “They were able to offer us efficiency, transparency and innovation,” says Carlucci. Citi provided competitive spreads and transparent FX rates for the port cost management business.</p>
<p>With the help of Citi’s solution, PortPayables moved to the payment file upload solution last month. The logic behind the new accounts payable system is clear. “In the past, we used to transact each payment manually, one by one,” says Carlucci. “But now, we upload multiple transactions simultaneously through a single file and send it to Citi. Once the bank receives the payments, it processes them in a single go. There is a substantial increase in control and efficiency.” Moreover, the instant availability of the SWIFT message (MT 103) allows the beneficiary of the payment to receive a payment confirmation. So even in the rare case that a payment is delayed in transit, the shipping vessel can still clear the port. By integrating its system with Citi’s, DA-Desk is now in a position to accommodate a variety of payment formats under one roof. Carlucci adds: “We can now easily identify elements that are missing and are able to achieve nearly 100% straight through processing (STP) rates. Citi’s solution has benefited us enormously from that perspective.” The agreement was reached at a formal meeting held in Dublin, with the solution implemented within two months. A clear-cut service level agreement (SLA) allowed DA-Desk to determine the timelines and relative importance of each service provided by Citi. Communication also played a fundamental role during the implementation stage. Daily phone calls were bolstered by a thorough weekly review.</p>
<p>“On top of this, Citi was able to offer DA-Desk superior client delivery service by means of two service teams,” says Raman. An internal team based in London is dedicated to DA-Desk, helping with product development, while a local team in Dubai responds to technical requirements. The next step of the DA-Desk and Citi’s relationship will be developing innovative products tailored to the future of the shipping industry.</p>

<br/>
<p>ITV is the largest commercial television network in the UK. It is the home of popular television from the biggest entertainment events, to original drama, major sport, landmark factual series and independent news. It operates a family of channels including ITV1, ITV2, ITV3 and ITV4 and CITV which are broadcast free-to-air on analogue (ITV1 only), Freeview, digital satellite (Sky/Freesat) and cable. ITV is also focused on delivering its programming across multiple platforms including itv.com, video on demand on cable television and other ‘closed’ platforms, mobile devices and games consoles.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem</h2>
<p>The company’s treasury team wanted to utilise technology in order to create a more efficient back office operation which was less reliant on manual processes. Their vision involved a more efficient bank account structure, utilisation of an in-house bank to record the zero balance transactions and settlement of inter-company invoices, straight through processing for payments, balance reporting (UK and overseas), bank statements for reconciliations, deal confirmations and accounting. In addition ITV was looking to use internal data more effectively. Replacement of the treasury management system (TMS) was central to achieving these goals.</p>
<p>One of the key motivating factors behind the change-over was the fact that the treasury had a labour-intensive payments processing and accounting system in place for treasury transactions. Although the data was already in the existing TMS, it still had to be input manually via the treasury’s internet banking terminal and manually input into the ERP system (Oracle). With a new TMS, a payments file could be created and the data could be fed seamlessly to the banking system and processed automatically, significantly reducing human error and improving security and control. Also all accounting could be interfaced into the group’s general ledger in Oracle. To address these issues, the company was looking for a solution that could be integrated with its new TMS and could be configured to meet any specific requirements. ITV turned to Barclays Bank to assist it in overcoming this challenge.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">Solved</h2>
<p>Barclays, ITV’s main relationship bank, proposed SWIFT Corporate Access as a solution to ITV’s problems. “Initially, we believed SWIFT for Corporates would be expensive, especially when we took into consideration the number of payments we made,” admits Karen Fagan, Finance Manager at ITV’s Business Service Centre. “But Barclays was able to assure us that the price had come down significantly and that it would be an ideal solution for delivering flexibility and functionality. We held a workshop with our payments and treasury teams, facilitated by PwC’s treasury consultancy, who were assisting the wider project. We were looking for a future-proof system and we realised that if we moved to SWIFT, as well as getting our bank statements in, we could look at improving our payments, bank reconciliations and deal confirmation process,” says Karen.</p>
<p>The company also engaged a SWIFT service bureau to assist with the project. “We started looking at different bureaux and eventually went with Bottomline. We wanted seamless, straight through processing (STP) so it was important that the people we involved in the project had existing relationships themselves. This was the case with Barclays, Bottomline, and Wall Street Systems, and has meant the integration has run very smoothly.”</p>
<p>Introducing SWIFT Corporate Access has delivered a number of benefits to ITV. These include only having a single treasury platform to maintain and achieving high levels of automation and STP. “As the team arrives every morning, all the payments information is waiting for them. The new SWIFT system has also allowed the treasury to make a number of efficiencies, and has even reduced the amount of human resources required for back office processing, meaning that staff can be transferred onto more value-added tasks,” explains Karen. The treasury has also saved on the time it takes to input and validate information, reducing the treasury month-end timetable from five days to two. These efficiencies have been consolidated by enabling the TMS system to ‘talk’ directly to SWIFT through the new bureau, which in turn communicates with Barclays and allows the treasury to conduct its banking processes in an efficient, integrated manner.</p>



","ITV had a complex cash pool structure with a large number of varying balances on each of the accounts across the pool. As such, the company wanted to consolidate its cash position and sweep excess funds to zero balanced pool headers for each currency. The new cash pooling arrangement would allow the company to consolidate its bank accounts and improve its cash management structure.",,2012-02-01,Case Studies,True

<br/>
<br/>
<p>Henkel is one of the world’s leading producers of detergents, cosmetics and adhesives. Founded in 1876, the Düsseldorf-based company has gone on to establish footholds in European, American and Asian markets, employing some 48,000 people across the world. In 2010, Henkel’s sales increased by 11.2% to over €15 billion, with 41% of that figure attributed to demand in emerging markets such as China. The Asian Tiger economy is expected to become the second most important market for Henkel in terms of annual sales by 2015.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>“Faced with unpredictable regulatory conditions and a rapidly changing economic environment, Henkel needed to overcome the challenge of managing its cash surplus more effectively,” says Fabian Boklage, Regional Treasury Manager, Asia Pacific. “The company’s cash management strategy, which is underpinned by an RMB pooling solution, centred on two core concerns,” he explains.</p>
<p>Firstly, in order to sustain its double digit growth, the company required a sufficient level of liquidity so as to be able to fund its daily operations and new investments. Secondly, soaring economic growth in China has led to high inflation, meaning that overnight bank deposits register negative real yields. “Regulation is a big issue for us, as deposit rates are far below inflation levels,” adds Boklage.</p>
<p>Moreover, “Henkel has a centralised treasury organisation with a global policy. Financial investments in China need to be aligned with our headquarters. The market for higher yielding short-term deposits (structured deposits) does not meet our expectations in terms of transparency”. As such, Henkel was finding it difficult to know where to place its surplus RMB cash in the short term to achieve yield whilst not compromising on security or liquidity.</p>
<p>“We knew that we must be able to achieve better returns than we were on our deposits and we started to look for smarter renminbi-denominated investments,” comments Boklage. “We wanted to take advantage of the renminbi appreciation and the relatively high yields, in comparison to euro and US dollar yields, but naturally we also have a risk tolerance.”</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>In overcoming this short-term investment challenge – and with the additional objective of wanting to diversify the company’s counterparty risks – Henkel turned to J.P. Morgan Asset Management and its onshore AAA rated RMB money market fund (MMF), which was the first of its kind to be established in China.</p>
<p>The fund is managed by China Investment Fund Management (CIFM), a joint venture between J.P. Morgan Asset Management and Shanghai International Trust and Investment Co Ltd., with direct oversight by J.P. Morgan Asset Management. The CIFM RMB MMF, as it is known, was launched in early 2005 and Henkel has been investing in the fund since June 2011.</p>
<p>Not only did the fund offer an excellent track record, with its top notch rating, Henkel was also pleased with the transparency that this provided. Furthermore, J.P. Morgan Asset Management was able to offer Henkel T+1 liquidity through the fund, matching a core need of Henkel’s dynamic business environment in China. Another advantage of such an investment is that, while interest earned on bank deposits in China are subject to tax, roughly 25%, dividends from money market fund investments are exempt from such duties.</p>
<p>Boklage believes that the combination of the liquidity benefits and the safety and transparency of the CIFM RMB MMF make it an ideal tool for treasurers looking to invest surplus cash onshore in China, whilst achieving a decent return. In addition, the fund has the ability to handle large liquidity flows equivalent to $2 billion. “My personal opinion is that J.P. Morgan Asset Management is offering a very useful, value-added product here. Without it, investing in China is extremely challenging and time consuming,” he concludes.</p>

Problem Solved: A global software and services company,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>We discover how a corporate treasury team worked with its MMF portal partner – State Street Fund Connect<sup>SM</sup> – to achieve a consolidated view of all money fund trades, balances and accruals in real time. The implementation involved full integration with both a treasury workstation and the company’s analytics system.</p>

<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>With continuing global market turmoil causing uncertainty about the creditworthiness of banks and other financial institutions, treasurers are increasingly seeking the ability to quantify their exposures to such counterparties quickly and easily. This global software company is no exception.</p>
<p>Using money market funds (MMFs) as a key investment tool, the company was looking to implement an efficient, streamlined process for investing in MMFs that would also recognise the value of direct electronic access to fund providers. According to the software company’s treasury representative, the group had traditionally, “traded via each individual fund provider’s website.” As part of an overall centralisation and efficiency drive, the company wanted to find a way to standardise this process, with the additional objectives of improving financial reporting, internal compliance and exposure management.</p>
<p>An MMF portal was an obvious solution, but the choice of portal provider was crucial as the treasury department wanted both its treasury workstation and analytics system to be synced with the portal for improved visibility and transparency. “A provider that would offer both flexibility and expertise was therefore imperative,” he said. “We were looking for real-time event-driven integration in addition to a batched overnight integration.”</p>
<p>An RFP was distributed to a select handful of portal providers, outlining the requirement for full integration with a consolidated view of all trades, balances and accruals all in real-time.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>State Street Fund Connect was chosen to fulfil these requirements. The initial discussion and planning stages were in June 2011 and full integration was achieved by August 2011. This turnaround time was impressive given the corporation’s intricate approval and sign-off processes.</p>
<p>From the outset, the treasury department was impressed with the service quality provided: “State Street took on the onus of doing as much of the work as possible – offering integration and consultation as an integral part of their solution.” Indeed, by figuring out how to fit the solution around the company’s processes, rather than vice versa, State Street sought to minimise any extra cost for the company and to ensure a seamless integration.</p>
<p>Moreover, “Rather than the company having to deal with two separate vendors, State Street liaised directly with our treasury workstation provider to make sure the coding would work – integrating that data feed themselves,” they say. This meant that treasury staff could focus on their core roles and continue to add value to the business while the implementation took place.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Transparency Connect… allows investors to easily quantify their pro-rata exposures across criteria including issuer, country, instrument type and maturity buckets.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The software company also benefited from State Street’s new transparency solution – Transparency Connect – a standard feature with Fund Connect. Transparency Connect takes portfolio holdings analysis to the next level by linking money fund investments to the underlying holdings. This allows investors to easily quantify their pro-rata exposures across criteria including issuer, country, instrument type and maturity buckets. Investors can also use the software to compare funds.</p>
<p>“This is genuinely the solution that we have been waiting for,” says the company’s treasury representative. “Over and above the enhanced reporting functionalities, the ability to really drill down into holdings and to measure and manage exposures, we can also set limits on how much we can trade, as well as alerts when limits are close to being reached. Another key feature of the service for us is the direct disclosure the portal provides. This reporting gives us all the benefits of having direct access to a fund manager without the headache of having to go to each of their websites. Essentially, we have a complete, holistic view across our global MMF investments at the click of a button.”</p>

<p>“Amgen’s treasury team was looking to optimise the risk/return profile of our investment portfolio while at the same time increase yield,” says William Lundberg, Director of Capital Markets &amp; Investments. “Fixed income investing has become especially challenging in a low rate environment,” he continues. As such, William and Luis were concerned about how low the ‘income cushion’ was in market value weighted bond indices (eg Barclays Aggregate).</p>

<p>William Lundberg and Luis Arrieta have been managing Amgen’s $17 billion investment portfolio since 2008. The Investments team at Amgen continuously engages its external asset managers on risk management, liquidity, compliance, and strategic and tactical asset allocation decisions. The portfolio is invested in a wide range of asset classes, such as money market funds, treasury and agency securities, corporate bonds, mortgage and other asset-backed securities, high yield bonds and emerging market debt. The team’s diligent portfolio management process has allowed them to outperform their peers over the last three plus years.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>“The income cushion is the amount interest rates can increase before offsetting the coupon income and producing a total return of 0%,” explains Luis Arrieta, Head of Investments. “Five years ago, for a one-five year government/credit strategy, that income cushion was 210 basis points; today, it stands at just 39 basis points. This made us reluctant to increase the yield of the portfolio by simply extending its duration.”</p>
<p>“In addition to this,” says William, “the macroeconomic environment is more uncertain today than it has been in recent history. The US may already be in a double dip recession, the Eurozone appears to have no viable solution to its problems, and China has the potential for a hard landing.” Being a corporate investor, Amgen needed a solution that provided downside protection, flexibility for potential large uses of cash, and controlled volatility.</p>


<h4 id=""william-and-luis-top-five-rules-for-high-yield-corporate-investors"">William and Luis’ top five rules for high yield corporate investors</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Know your short and long term liquidity profile – would you have a problem holding to maturity?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Constantly question your high yield manager about security selection, refinancing risk, covenants, etc. Favour companies with hard assets and high liquidation values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New issue concessions boost returns – be sure your maturity guidelines allow for purchases of new issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure senior management is well informed at all times – how bad can things get? Look at history, use judgment, keep an open mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep a relative value mindset – look across all asset classes within your portfolio.</p>
</li>
</ol>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>“We explored several sectors of the fixed income market to find an asset allocation that would enhance the yield of our portfolio while making sure the risks associated with doing so could be managed carefully,” says Luis. Amgen partnered with different investment firms, including the Liquidity Management team at DB Advisors, the global institutional asset management business of the Deutsche Bank Group, and determined that the high yield sector of the fixed income market was a viable option, given its attractive yields and historical low correlation with investment grade bonds. However, given the conservative nature of corporate investors, a customised solution was needed.</p>
<p>“The exposure to high yield in the overall portfolio is relatively small; we limit our investments in high yield bonds to no more than 5% of the total,” says William, “with this in mind, we decided to work with the High Yield Team of DB Advisors to develop a ‘high quality’, high yield mandate suitable for the needs and constraints of Amgen.” DB Advisors and Amgen determined that the sweet spot given their objective and risk tolerance was to invest in the BB/B space of the high yield universe. “Among other things, we liked the relatively low level of defaults experienced by BB/B issuers and what appears to be an attractive risk/return trade driven by the fact that many institutional investors are not permitted to invest in bonds rated below investment grade (BBB). This market segmentation phenomenon may allow some investors to find high yield bonds at very attractive prices,” says Luis.</p>
<p>With this in mind, DB Advisors helped Amgen construct a portfolio of high yield bonds with relatively short duration and a high quality bias. The yield of this portfolio is five times greater than the yield in their investment grade portfolio of similar duration. “We understand there’s going to be more volatility in this sector, but we believe this is an attractive trade that will benefit our overall portfolio returns in the long run,” says William.</p>

<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>Roche was seeking a standardised, global supplier financing solution that offered a worldwide contract framework. “Suppliers serving Roche subsidiaries in various countries couldn’t be served equally by local solutions,” Schlageter explains. “Bank contracts were local contracts and needed to be reviewed locally and by treasury and accounting at our headquarters, and were different for each country.”</p>
<p>Additionally, Roche wanted a harmonised IT-interface that would allow the company to fully utilise its global SWIFT-based payment factory connectivity and payment process for invoice-related data exchange with its banks.</p>
<p>Roche sought a bank that could offer the company a global solution that would allow it to standardise its documentation, contracts and technology. In turn, this would allow Roche to fully exploit the functionality of its payment factory, using SWIFT connectivity globally and its payment process for invoice-related data exchange with its supplier financing banks.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>Deutsche Bank was chosen, because it could resolve Roche’s problems and was able to meet all its requirements. “Deutsche Bank offered a global solution that provided a harmonised IT-solution that further enhanced the already standardised accounts payable (A/P) payment process – the solution now offers increased operational efficiency plus supplier financing,” says Denis Reneau, SAP Treasury IT Specialist and IT Project Manager at Roche.</p>
<p>The pilot implementation in Europe with Deutsche Bank was assessed during the second half of 2010 and went live in February 2011 in Spain, in accordance with the agreed project implementation plan. The solution has already been implemented in Portugal in March 2011. Deutsche will be helping to roll out the solution in other parts of Europe – with France, Italy and Switzerland as the next countries to be included in the rollout.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank’s solution is now much more quickly extendable to other countries than previously available solutions. It also allows suppliers to benefit from supplier financing across borders. Roche’s subsidiaries can join the supplier financing set-up by changing the master data of participating suppliers and by continuing with their established accounts payables processes. “The supplier finance contract was harmonised across countries – so review by treasury and accounting at headquarters only needed to take place once,” says Schlageter.</p>
<p>Additionally, the implemented solution is also beneficial for Roche’s supplier base – which has become more and more regional or global – as it gives them access to regional, if not global, web-based supplier finance platforms, thereby increasing the attractiveness of Roche’s supplier financing programme. As a result, return on investment (ROI) has experienced substantial improvement.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank’s solution also significantly improved Roche’s access to SWIFT. “File-delivery via SWIFT was a prerequisite for our supplier finance solution as we send all our payment files via SWIFT FileAct – and with supplier finance we make use of our payment files to inform Deutsche Bank about invoices eligible for supplier finance,” explains Reneau. “It makes even more use out of our existing SWIFT landscape – no new IT interface was necessary.”</p>

<p>Thomas Cook Nederland wanted to do away with paper-based invoices in order to improve reconciliation and remove manual intervention.

<p>One of the world’s leading travel operators, Thomas Cook Group PLC has 22.5m customers across 21 countries worldwide. Its Dutch arm, Thomas Cook Nederland BV, generated sales of £8.9 billion in 2010. The company employs some 750 people, approximately 450 of whom work in 127 travel shops in the Netherlands. Each year, 1m Dutch holidaymakers choose Thomas Cook NL to arrange their trips.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>When customers book their holiday with Thomas Cook Nederland BV, they receive a paper-based invoice. The invoice contains a payment reference, which the customer must mention in the payment, enabling the travel company to process it. However, the reference information the customer provides in the payment is often incorrect or incomplete, making seamless reconciliation very difficult for the travel operator. Edo Rensman, Manager Finance and Administration, Thomas Cook Nederland BV, explains some of the issues the company commonly encounters: “Take for example the name ‘Jansen’, which is very popular in the Netherlands. If we happen to receive a payment with just the words ‘Jansen, Costa Brava’ mentioned in it, that can be extremely problematic for us. We simply can’t reconcile automatically with that information as it does not provide sufficient detail for the system.”</p>
<p>As a result, the company is obliged to book such payments manually, causing inefficiencies and making the reconciliation process far lengthier than it need be. In addition, due to the 56-day refund period mandated by the PSD, the payer is able to cancel a payment made within that window. This means that last-minute bookers and late payers could cancel their payments and get their Thomas Cook holiday for free. Thomas Cook Nederland BV turned to ING for help in overcoming these challenges.”</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>The first thing that the ING team did was to sit down with the treasury personnel at Thomas Cook Nederland BV and discuss the difficulties they were experiencing. “ING sent their representatives over to our offices and we spent a few hours talking about all our processes and problems,” says Edo. “Before they arrived, I was a little sceptical as to the value that we would derive from the session and I imagined that they were going to give us the ‘hard sell’, but they didn’t. It was just a chat and a very broad discussion, which helped both them and us to better understand the challenges we were facing.”</p>
<p>The bank put the client and its problems centre-stage by conducting a financial supply chain (FSC) scan; a special diagnostic check that allows ING to familiarise itself with its client’s internal processes and deepen its understanding of the range of challenges the client faces. Once the scan had been performed, the bank was then in a position to help Thomas Cook Nederland BV to overcome its problems. “Once we had fully understood the challenges Thomas Cook Nederland BV faced, we put forward a proposal to implement an e-payment solution. Our FSC approach to a client’s difficulties is an ideal way of putting their needs first and prioritising their objectives,” says Erik Honing, Cash Management Consultant at ING. “This ‘Problem Solved’ is a fine example of a local Dutch issue. In general, for both parties, the FSC approach itself is also an excellent way for better understanding of international processes.”</p>
<p>The e-payment solution is delivered via e-mail and supported by a payments platform known as iDEAL in the Netherlands. iDEAL is an online payments system that is recognised among Dutch customers for its trustworthiness and reliability. It is a guaranteed payment platform, which means that Thomas Cook Nederland BV no longer has to worry about customers cancelling their direct debit payments. In turn, this has led to more accurate cash flow forecasting and means that less time and fewer resources are spent on chasing payments.</p>
<p>“We had approval from the CFO on 24<sup>th</sup> May and the e-payment email and iDEAL system were tested and implemented just a few weeks later. On 13<sup>th</sup> July we received our first payment using iDEAL. Since the new system was implemented, we are in much closer contact with ING. “We expect the new system to pay for itself within five months and we fully intend to migrate more of our customers onto this payment method going forward,” says Edo. In terms of processes, Thomas Cook Nederland BV now sends out an email to the customer with a link to the iDEAL platform. By clicking on the link, customers are redirected to the website of their own bank, from where they make the payment. The system fills in many of the details automatically, leaving the customer with little to do to complete the payment. This also ensures that Thomas Cook Nederland BV has the necessary information to be able to seamlessly reconcile the payment, meaning less time and fewer resources have to be allocated to chasing up payments.</p>

After hearing what each bank offered Crivello defined a list of ‘must haves’ and ‘nice to haves’ on the basis of Recordati’s needs.</p>
<p>“We had to have a bank with a global presence. As a widespread group that was vital, particularly if we choose to expand in the future. That presence needs to run deeply too – it is important that the bank can provide personal contacts in each country, rather than just some help desk contact number for a country far away. In terms of ‘nice to haves’, we wanted online reporting capabilities for easy visibility from anywhere in the world.”</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>Deutsche Bank was chosen because it met all of Recordati’s requirements, as well as having a relationship with the Group stretching back to 1990. The project consisted of three core steps: cash centralisation, netting and reporting. Deutsche Bank Direct Internet (DBDI) platform offers modules in all of these areas and allows business units to access relevant features, statistics and accounts with the option of setting different permission levels established for each user based on their requirements.</p>
<p>A project team was established comprising the treasury, CFO and local finance units. Deutsche Bank contributed a relationship manager and project manager to the central team, and in-country support. “It was vital to involve colleagues from across Europe right from the start – some companies face resistance from subsidiaries, but we explained the need for cash concentration and the local teams agreed right away,” says Crivello.</p>
<p>Recordati established a multi-bank zero-balance cash pool at the centre of the Group, with all accounts linked with the DBDI platform. Deutsche Bank collected legal documents, opened accounts and set permissions for every participant. Local units were trained to understand how this Europe-wide pool works, with the impact on areas like their inter-day limits. They can all contact Deutsche locally for support. The cash pool is now in place in every country except for Greece – because local withholding taxes impose costs on inter-company loans – and Turkey – where neither notional nor physical pooling is permitted due to currency controls.</p>
<p>Establishing a netting system followed. “The subsidiaries participate in a monthly netting cycle,” says Tiberio Cesaroni, Deutsche Bank’s Head of Corporate Cash Management, Italy. “Each participant is notified when the cycle starts. They have two days to insert transactions into the DBDI system. Reconciliation follows – two days in which the treasury nets participants’ debits and credits. Each unit receives an email detailing their net position and either receives a payment from the centre, or makes a payment to it.”</p>
<p>As Recordati hoped, the system is much more efficient with fewer inter-company transactions, saving fees and time. The DBDI platform’s modular nature allows guarantees related to all subsidiaries’ activity to be viewed centrally, and letters of credit will soon be monitored and managed through the system. With SEPA’s ongoing rollout, problems experienced with Greek accounts may soon be resolved too – suppliers can be paid from accounts in Italy, for example, without any negative impact, under the payments’ system.</p>

<p>Piaggio is the largest European manufacturer of scooters and motorbikes and one of the world leaders in its industry. Piaggio is also a major international player in the light commercial vehicle business. The company, which is listed on the Italian Stock Exchange, is headquartered in Pontedera, Italy and has manufacturing plants in Spain, India, Vietnam and China, as well as in Italy. Almost two-thirds of Piaggio’s European annual sales are generated between the months of April and September, when demand for its products reaches its peak. Piaggio sells over 600,000 vehicles per year, 36% of which were sold in Asia and 60% in Europe in 2009.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>The company generates approximately 66% of its sales between the months of April and September, during which period it is inundated with receivables – 250,000 in an average year. On the other hand, in the first few months of the year, the company’s cash flows go in the opposite direction as the focus is on purchasing components in time for the production peak, which starts at the end of March. This means that in the first quarter of each year cash leaves the company and little flows in the opposite direction. This shortfall is covered using revolving and factoring credit facilities.</p>
<p>Cash flow is predictable, but the mismatch in the phases of Piaggio’s payments/collections cycle puts a strain on the company’s working capital. The seasonality of the cash flows is a peculiarity of the European sales and is not marked in Asia.</p>
<p>The seasonality of Piaggio’s European business meant that it was typically faced with annual interest charges of approximately €1m on a total net debt of €352m at the end of 2009. Moreover, with manufacturing plants and sales units across Europe, the company found itself trying to keep tabs on an unwieldy number of bank accounts. “We had segmentation with the former structure,” comments Mauro Prignoli, Senior Vice President, Head of Finance. “In Spain alone, we had ten bank accounts and in Germany there were five.” The company’s treasury department therefore sought a way to consolidate the number of its bank accounts and improve its cash management system so that it could reduce its bank charges and improve visibility.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>In its bid to improve control of its cash management, Prignoli’s department decided to appoint a single bank to simplify the existing arrangements and support the needs of the company’s subsidiaries. Four banks were shortlisted. Deutsche Bank came out on top because it ticked all the boxes on the list Prignoli had drawn up before he embarked on the project. “The main drivers for us were international coverage, bank relationship, flexibility of the cash management structure and reliability,” says Prignoli. “Deutsche Bank understood our needs and provided a customised solution.”</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank implemented a new cash management structure for Piaggio’s treasury department, leading to a reduction in bank accounts and consolidated cash management arrangements. The reduction in the number of its bank accounts by 15 (to a total of two per country) has allowed the company to reduce bank charges and interest. It has similarly reduced the amount of time that employees spend focusing on the collections procedure.</p>
<p>The changes have enabled Piaggio to cut out much of the duplication involved in processing payments. By integrating direct debits from Spain, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy and the UK, the solution will also allow Piaggio to migrate to SEPA direct debits in due course.</p>
<p>In addition, Deutsche Bank has provided Piaggio with an integrated communications gateway, db direct internet, which allows the company to connect to the bank with its SAP ERP system and Piteco TMS cash management module. “Deutsche delivered a solution integrated with our current treasury workstation and information systems. It is a very secure system, which is important for us. It is well integrated,” says Prignoli. The improvements have meant Prignoli now finds it easier to manage and control the company’s cash positions, enabling further efficiencies to be implemented. In the future, Prignoli says the company will look to extend Deutsche Bank’s solution to its cross-border inter-company transactions in Asia.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>A global insurance company implements a new investment strategy to match the company’s excess cash with its future claims.</p>

<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>Following the financial crisis, a global insurance company was looking to develop an investment strategy in order to manage its excess cash in multiple currencies more effectively. Having pulled back from the market during the crisis, the company was holding around £500m in euro, sterling and dollar. The funds were held in cash and long-term bonds.</p>
<p>The company wanted to match the investment of this cash with the company’s liabilities: claims which needed to be paid over a number of years. A high quality solution was required, as Laurie Carroll, Director, BNY Mellon Asset Management explains: “They didn’t want to have any concerns about credit or anything happening to the portfolio. That’s very common – people are a lot more cautious since the crisis.”</p>
<p>One solution under consideration was to invest the cash in a money market fund. However, this approach would not allow the excess funds to be matched to the liabilities. “If you had something you had to pay at the end of a one year period you could leave the cash in a money market fund, but you would be guessing that interest rates were going to go higher or lower,” comments Carroll. A more sophisticated solution was required.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>Having previously used BNY Mellon Asset Management’s solutions and services, the insurance company approached the Asset Management division to gauge what types of solutions could help them to achieve their goals. BNY Mellon’s 3-Tier Cash Management Strategy was suggested. This solution segments a corporation’s cash into three tiers by duration in order to meet the company’s cash needs as accurately as possible. The insurance company’s first tier, which represents day-to-day cash flows, was held in money market funds. However, it was felt that the funds required to meet claims in three to five years’ time would benefit from being designated as second/third tier cash, ie longer term cash.</p>
<p>The 3-Tier approach is a bespoke investment solution and BNY Mellon suggested several different portfolio models which could be adopted, ranging from sovereign-only debt to higher credit quality corporate debt. The insurance company was able to pick and choose instruments which corresponded to its risk parameters within the specified time period.</p>
<p>“We sat down with them, looked at the claims and reviewed what type of guidelines they wanted to put in place,” comments Carroll. “We went back and forth a number of times until the client felt we had reached the solution they had in their mind. We have a guideline checklist that goes through all fixed income investments that are available – we walked them through that; talked about the different risk-return scenarios and really looked at matching those liabilities with the return solutions and with things they wanted to accomplish with this money.”</p>
<p>Set up in early 2009, the solution adopted by the insurance company initially invested in sovereign-only debt. The implementation process, including discussing the insurance company’s investment objective, risk tolerance and liquidity requirements and considering the different models, took less than a month. The overall duration of the insurance company’s portfolio is three to four years but it also includes some long tail liabilities with a maturity of 15 years. Despite the longer durations, as the portfolio invests only in sovereign issues it is highly liquid.</p>
<p>The flexibility of the solution meant that the insurance company would be free to reassess the makeup of the portfolio in the future and introduce non-sovereign issues if desired. This flexibility represents one of the key points of differentiation between the 3-Tier approach and money market funds: investors in a money market fund cannot change the investment guidelines of the fund.</p>
<p>“A lot of people do think of cash as only deposits or money market funds,” says Carroll. “But look at what’s happened in the last couple of years – if you have kept all of your money in cash there has been a real opportunity loss. People are afraid to take risks, but their risk is just a fact of the investment horizon. By not doing something, you’re taking the risk that you’re not earning as much as you potentially could. Many companies are doing well and do have cash but they should be looking at what they do with that cash and dividing it up, rather than keeping it all in deposits. We feel that matching and taking a little bit of maturity duration is something that treasurers should review.”</p>

<p>IDEA Cellular is a publicly listed company, having been listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in March 2007. IDEA Cellular is a leading GSM mobile services operator in India with around 73m subscribers, under the brand IDEA. It is a pan-India integrated GSM operator covering the entire telephony landscape of the country, and has National Long Distance License (NLD) and International Long Distance License (ILD) operations.</p>
<p>IDEA Cellular’s parent company is Aditya Birla Group, India’s first truly multinational corporation. The group operates in 25 countries, and is anchored by over 130,000 employees belonging to 30 nationalities.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>The company’s key challenge was to reduce its cash to sales cycle, leveraging an efficient and technologically-enabled solution.</p>
<p>Anil Agrawal, GM, Finance &amp; Accounts, IDEA Cellular Limited, explains: “We have 22 telecom circles across the country, which are serviced by a large number of distributors for our prepaid business. When we first rolled out the pre-paid business under the distributor model, our main mode of payments collection was via cheques. The disadvantage of this mode of collection was higher credit risk and cost of collection. We were keen to implement an electronic mode of collection that would lower credit risk, improve our cash to sales cycle and lower the cost of collections.”</p>
<p>To achieve this objective, IDEA Cellular turned to Deutsche Bank for a solution that would enable its distributors to pay electronically. In addition, the client was also looking for other cash management services such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) integration and auto account reconciliation services.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>IDEA Cellular was initially considering solutions like Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) and National Electronic Fund Transfer System (NEFT). These solutions have the ability to improve the efficiency of the entire collections process significantly. However, one of the major downsides of the solutions is the lack of payer identification data, which is crucial for accounts receivables reconciliation. This is further amplified by India’s geographical size and the large number of drawee banks in the country. Compounding the situation further was IDEA Cellular’s requirement for a customised solution on an immediate basis, given the urgent need to improve efficiencies by migrating collections to an electronic mode.</p>
<p>“The key differentiator for Deutsche Bank was its unique Payer ID solution, which enables us to streamline our accounts receivables reconciliation with complete ease and effectively,” says Agrawal. “The solution allows IDEA Cellular to identify the payment party in a fully automated manner even though such information is not provided by the remitting bank. Using the concept of a unique virtual account number provided to each party for making payments to IDEA, Deutsche Bank is able to identify the payer and provide the information to IDEA via a secure channel for automated reconciliation.”</p>
<p>Agrawal further adds, “Deutsche Bank’s solution met our requirements fully. This, coupled with its proven track-record of implementing technologically-enabled solutions in a quick turnaround time, with minimal interruption to our ERP system, was a key factor for us to award the mandate to Deutsche Bank. We are impressed with the professionalism shown by the team, which includes a strong service team for our daily requirements.”</p>
<p>Agrawal continues, “Since the successful implementation of Payer ID, we have seen tangible benefits in terms of faster sales to collection, a more efficient process flow and improved credit risk control. This solution gives us a great opportunity to scale up without incurring additional overhead costs.”</p>
<p>“I am extremely satisfied and glad that we appointed Deutsche Bank for this solution. They have shown a lot of commitment in delivery and meeting our requirements comprehensively.”</p>

<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>Due to the rapid growth that Novartis China had been experiencing, the company’s treasury function was experiencing a number of challenges. The main challenge was how to manage the company’s capital more efficiently. Novartis China’s strategy was to keep as little cash as possible in bank accounts, relying mainly on its cash pool and temporary overdrafts to meet short-term financing needs. Bank loans were kept to a minimum.</p>
<p>“Some companies borrow more than necessary for their immediate needs, and keep the cash idle in their account, or make structured deposits, in case they need funding,” says Sherwin Zhang, Country Treasurer, Novartis China. “This is a practical solution if you think credit is going to be harder to obtain. However at Novartis, we won’t adopt such a strategy as it dramatically reduces cash efficiency and is against our treasury guidelines.”</p>
<p>So Novartis China was faced with the challenge of further reducing the company’s idle cash balance, lowering the company’s reliance on external borrowing, as well as negotiating more favourable overdraft terms. According to Zhang, overdrafts are much more efficient than loans because they can be paid off much more quickly, whereas loans can result in spare cash sitting in deposit accounts earning a lower interest rate than that being paid on the loan. While intercompany loans are a more cost-effective option, it was felt that these were more complicated to arrange and since they operate on fixed tenors, this makes it difficult to match them closely to funding needs.</p>
<p>After a highly competitive selection process, Novartis China decided to partner with Citi to help overcome these challenges.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>The solution was to set up an integrated cash management system, based on a domestic zero-balancing cash pool, online banking and renegotiated overdraft facilities. The company’s spare cash is now swept into one account, where it can be deployed more efficiently. Knowing exactly how much cash is in the system, how much is forecast to be in the system, and when bank loans will be needed, has reduced the company’s external borrowing requirements and improved cash efficiency.</p>
<p>“We selected Citi as our main bank because it has the most mature and stable cash management system,” explains Zhang. “With the flexibility of cash pooling, we rely more on our forecasting, enabling us to keep cash balances low. We still use bank loans, though less so. Although they are less flexible than overdrafts, they are often cheaper. The key is to get the right balance between loans and overdrafts.”</p>
<p>While this solution was originally implemented in 2006, its introduction was well-timed as it helped the company to deal with the global financial crisis which hit China in 2008. The cash pool originally involved four subsidiary companies, but now includes all nine subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Although the credit environment is now not as tough as it was during 2008 and 2009, Novartis China is still reaping the benefits of low cash balances and overdrafts for temporary funding, as and when required.</p>

<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>The company needed to reduce the amount of resource-intensive, manual intervention required to process and initiate a foreign currency payment, as it currently processes claim payments in over 200 countries worldwide. Not only were these manual processes leading to high administrative costs, but they also contributed to a higher number of payment errors. Each time the company submitted bank account details that were incomplete or in the wrong format, the insurer incurred additional transactional fees as payments had to be manually re-processed and initiated. The additional time to process these payments also led to decreased satisfaction for both members and providers.</p>
<p>As such, the insurer needed a solution that could be easily integrated within its own, existing applications and one that was able to capture and validate the correct beneficiary bank account and payment routing information before the company submitted payment instructions to Citi.</p>
<p>By automating the capture and validation of bank account details via its secure online member and provider websites, the company would be able to remove the manual payment initiation process and reduce error rates and correction costs for failed payments, while also lowering the overall cost of payment processing and significantly improving the overall customer experience. In addition, this scalable solution would help support the company’s growth plans while continuing to deliver optimal customer service.</p>

<p>Using Bank Wizard Global to validate the bank details of its insurance claim payees at the start of the payment process, the insurer is able to ensure its payments reach the correct beneficiaries across the globe quickly, efficiently and with minimal risk of failure.</p>
<p>As part of the project, Experian Payments also provided the company with consultancy services to help them migrate to Citi’s WorldLink® platform, the bank’s cross-border, global payment system for corporates and financial institutions.</p>
<p>Introducing an automated payment validation solution that removes manual processes has enabled the insurer to comply with Citi’s user guidelines for international ACH and wire payments, while improving its STP rates for cross-border and international payments. Bank Wizard Global also allows the insurer to validate BBANs and generate associated IBANs and BICs, particularly for territories within the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA).</p>
<p>The solution is now live. Using Citi to transfer claim payments, Bank Wizard Global allows the company to promptly reimburse personal claimants and hospitals in foreign currencies via the lowest cost method, whilst also halving the claims cycle for people seeking medical treatment abroad.</p>
<p>The company comments, “From day one we were impressed by Experian Payments’ collaborative approach and technical expertise, due to their ability to understand our requirements and those of our bank, Citi.

<li>
<p>Manual processing of account reconciliations was laborious. Real-time monitoring of bank account closing balances and bank transaction processing were not possible with the existing systems.</p>

<p>In order to ensure a successful project implementation, CNOOC Limited’s treasury department deployed key members of the business and IT team to set up a strong joint-project team with system provider SunGard. There were however numerous challenges that CNOOC Limited had to deal with during the implementation period. These included the fact that the system structure was rather complex and business modules were numerous. Additionally, the implementation involved CNOOC Limited’s ERP, budgeting system (Hyperion) and direct connections with more than ten banks. However, “Through a comprehensive planning of the project and working closely with the internal ERP project team, budget planning project team and seamlessly co-operating with external banking partners, the project went live successfully after one year and has realised its pre-set objectives,” says Huang.</p>
<p>The TMS implementation has allowed CNOOC Limited to raise its treasury management operations in China to a new level. A single front, middle and back-office treasury operation platform with comprehensive treasury functionality has been built. Host-to-host connections with CNOOC Limited’s partner banks, connectivity with SAP, Bloomberg and Hyperion have also been realised, thereby improving STP rates.</p>
<p>Through the connection with banking systems, the company can realise real-time (or interval) monitoring of cash; automation of bank reconciliations also improved responsiveness, the accuracy of daily transactions and the reliability of short-term cash flow forecasting. Treasury operations have also become increasingly automated, improving efficiency and reducing the error and fraud risks of manual processing. The cash pool management tool has also allowed CNOOC Limited to further enhance treasury management centralisation, leverage on the scale of its cash position and improve the efficiency of its cash.</p>
<p>On the back of this, CNOOC Limited has built a strong risk management and control system, which has meant that the company can now meet company internal compliance and SOX 404 regulatory requirements. At the same time, CNOOC Limited can also meet the requirements of international accounting standards and automation of accounting for daily treasury activities. In summary, the TMS implementation has provided CNOOC Limited with a powerful IT tool to enhance and improve treasury management. As Huang concludes, “The success of this project is one of the milestones in promoting and advancing China corporate treasury management as a whole.”</p>

<p>Prior to 2007, Ineos – at that time called Hydro Polymers, part of a Group Hydro organisation – was using a proprietary Group Hydro ERP system called FELOS. This system covered payments worldwide.

<p>A global manufacturer of petrochemicals, speciality chemicals and oil products, Ineos comprises 17 businesses, each with a major chemical company heritage. The company’s production network spans 64 manufacturing facilities in 14 countries worldwide. The group’s annual turnover is in excess of $40 billion.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>Reconciliation of bank accounts and incoming payments was also handled manually, taking up significant resources. At the time, direct debits did not form part of the integration between the company and its house bank. During 2007, Hydro Polymers was separated from the Group Hydro organisation into an independent company and Danske Bank Group was selected as Hydro Polymers’ new house bank.</p>
<p>With this new choice of house bank, the company also decided to implement SAP in place of the FELOS system. Danske Bank Group promised to deliver a full-scale international payment set-up covered by a single point-of-entry integrated with Hydro’s SAP system. “We had several meetings with the client to discover their real pain points and work towards their tight implementation deadline, which was due to the divestment from Norsk Hydro,” remarks Jakob Holst, Head of ERP Business Integration, Danske Bank Group.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>Danske Bank Group had just finalised an SAP/PAYMUL module developed in partnership with SAP headquarters in Walldorf. The module offered a single file format and single point-of-entry approach in all countries covered by the tender issued by Hydro Polymers – now Ineos.</p>
<p>Ineos joined the programme as a pilot customer in February 2007. According to Solveig Findal-Hansen, Central Accounting Officer, Norway, “We felt a very strong commitment to the project, particularly from the ERP Business Integration department of Danske Bank Group, who built the necessary bridges between Ineos, SAP and the implementation team to ensure a timely implementation.”</p>
<p>Today, Ineos has a very efficient STP both in terms of formats and communication and covering all bank-related processes directly in SAP. These bank-related business processes include payables, receivables, direct debits, salary payments, reconciliation and automatic update of currency rates.</p>
<p>The solution has automated all file traffic and process handling and removed the need for manual input, saving the company a great deal of time and resources. All payments are executed upon receipt by Danske Bank Group without further human intervention because payment approval now takes place directly in SAP before being sent to Danske Bank Group’s central EDI gateway. “The STP solution has also ensured a secure and fail-safe file handling process internally at Ineos which is achieved by using Danske Bank Group’s Business EDI setup,” remarks Findal-Hansen.</p>
<p>The solution has made the company’s daily operations at accounting level more efficient because of the extremely high STP rates achieved both on incoming and on outgoing payments. Reconciliation now takes up a fraction of the time spent previously and as the solution covers six countries, but can be handled centrally from Oslo, the administrative burden on the company has been significantly reduced.</p>
<p>Findal-Hansen elaborates, “The solution implemented covers all kinds of payments including salaries and SEPA payments within Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, the UK and Germany. The solution really does save me and my team a huge amount of work because of the degree of automation achieved.”</p>
<p>In the future, there is the potential for Ineos to develop the solution since Danske Bank Group has a one-bank-one-system offering in many other countries. Ineos may also choose a central e-invoicing and direct debit set-up handled out of a payment factory in Norway, covering all countries within the Ineos organisation.</p>

In addition to this entity, the treasury organisation was further developed in order to centralise the company’s daily cash position fully.</p>

<p>A publicly-listed Belgian company, Nyrstar is a leading global multi-metals business and the world’s largest producer of zinc. The group reported revenues of over €2.4 billion in 2008 and has approximately 3,200 employees across four continents.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>The metals business is primarily USD-based, but Nyrstar’s conversion activities – turning concentrate into metal – are carried out by plants in Europe, Australia and the US, giving rise to some currency discrepancies.</p>
<p>Prior to reviewing the business model, Nyrstar’s plants processed their collections and payments locally and independently. The introduction of the central commercial entity was considered as an opportunity to streamline global cash management and manage the group’s liquidity globally, with the following objectives in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Funds to be managed out of the Belgian treasury headquarters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set up a centralised cash management structure for all global group companies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase efficiency in collection processes and liquidity management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maximise straight through processing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce the cost of transaction processing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve group overview of cash management activities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Nyrstar issued a Request for Proposal for the cash management business in each of its main currencies, looking for a best-in-class solution to address all of the above requirements. At the end of 2008, Deutsche Bank was mandated to become the global clearer for Nyrstar’s USD business and to implement the proposed structure.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>The first part of the solution was to set up USD accounts for making payments relating to the purchase of concentrate and receiving collection flows relating to the company’s worldwide sales. Accounts were opened in Singapore and the US and managed centrally from the Belgian headquarters. Westpac, Deutsche Bank’s partner bank in Australia, being the incumbent bank of Nyrstar’s Australian plant, was maintained and integrated in the structure. All of Nyrstar’s accounts with Deutsche Bank are accessible via Deutsche Bank’s online portal ‘db direct internet’, meaning that the treasury headquarters in Belgium have control over the group’s cash, as requested.</p>
<p>In response to Nyrstar’s needs, Deutsche Bank implemented a ‘USD sweep with the sun’ solution, taking advantage of time zone differences as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>USD receivables in Asia are collected on accounts in Deutsche Bank Singapore and are visible via Deutsche Bank’s electronic banking platform, db direct internet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At end-of-day Singapore time (SGT), all available funds are zero balanced to the local concentration account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Excess cash in the local concentration account is transferred intra-day to the global USD concentration pool at Deutsche Bank New York. As the funds are credited in the early morning (EST), funds can be used for daily payments in New York or for short-term cash management needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At end-of-day New York time (EST), all available funds are zero balanced to the local concentration account. Excess cash is then automatically invested overnight.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The new global USD cash concentration structure provided by Deutsche Bank has achieved Nyrstar’s objectives of increasing the efficiency of collections and liquidity management, maximising straight through processing, reducing the cost of processing and improving the overall visibility of the company’s cash management. “The fact that Deutsche Bank was proposing a ‘sweep with the sun’ solution allowed the treasury in Belgium to deal with USD supplier and customer flows in the different time zones,” concludes Bert Heylen, Group Treasurer, Nyrstar.</p>

"Problem Solved: Tim Hashagen, Lufthansa","




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>When the financial crisis started in July 2007, Lufthansa stopped investing into money market funds, instead using a mixture of short-term deposits, commercial paper and direct investments to manage its excess cash. However, this approach had a number of shortcomings. The returns Lufthansa was receiving were unsatisfactory, while internal counterparty limits were in place restricting the amount that could be invested with any particular bank.</p>


<h4 class=""fn"">Tim Hashagen</h4>
<h5 class=""title"">Manager Treasury</h5>
<img alt=""Lufthansa logo"" class=""logo"" height=""26"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/lufthansa-logo-2009-120x26.png"" title=""Lufthansa"" width=""120""/>

<p>Headquartered in Frankfurt, aviation group Deutsche Lufthansa AG comprises five business areas: Passenger Airline Group, Logistics, Maintenance Repair Overhaul, Catering and IT Services. The group reported revenues of over €24 billion in 2008 and has over 107,000 employees.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>At the beginning of 2008, the decision was therefore taken to resume using money market funds to meet the company’s investment needs. “Our internal guideline requires us to keep a certain level of cash for daily operations and instead of using overnight deposits, we are now using money market funds,” says Tim Hashagen, Manager Treasury. “The funds are able to provide daily liquidity but can also generate an above-benchmark return by buying short-term securities if the fund does not exceed a weighted average maturity of 60 days. Therefore Lufthansa also uses money market funds instead of term deposits for cash which is not immediately needed. Additionally, other instruments besides money market funds are still used for medium-term investments to benefit from the interest-curve.”</p>
<p>One feature of money market funds is that they are ‘ring-fenced’ – in other words, they are managed as legal entities that are separate from their sponsors. As a result of this, and of the level of diversification within the funds themselves, money market funds can be utilised without using up the counterparty limits set by Lufthansa for individual banks.</p>
<p>Having decided to start using money market funds again, the next step was to choose a suitable fund. A number of different requirements needed to be taken into account. “We were looking for AAA-rated funds with daily liquidity and daily settlement,” comments Hashagen. “In order to invest in a fund, we needed a strong relationship with the bank. We also benchmark against EONIA, so we were looking for an investment which would perform above EONIA. Furthermore, we were looking to diversify our counterparty risk.”</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>After conducting a thorough due diligence exercise with <strong>J.P. Morgan Asset Management</strong>, Lufthansa decided to start using J.P. Morgan’s EUR Liquidity Fund again. As transparency over the running of the fund was a high priority for Lufthansa, due diligence was an essential aspect of the decision making process. In order to obtain as clear a view as possible of the fund’s control mechanisms and risk management tools, Hashagen spent a day meeting J.P. Morgan’s investment analysts and portfolio managers. “The process was very satisfying – they provided good support and we felt very comfortable with the product,” says Hashagen.</p>
<p>To diversify its investments the company has subsequently invested in four additional money market funds and has drawn on its experience with J.P. Morgan by employing a similar approach to due diligence in the selection process. The due diligence day was likewise considered such a success by J.P. Morgan that this approach has since been offered to other clients.</p>
<p>For Hashagen, one of the outstanding features of the J.P. Morgan EUR Liquidity Fund is its late cut-off time. Unlike many other funds, the J.P. Morgan fund offers a 14:30 CET cut-off time for clients to access cash on a same-day basis, meeting Lufthansa’s requirements for daily liquidity. Meanwhile, clients are serviced by a dedicated team which focuses solely on providing support for the fund’s institutional investors.</p>
<p>Another important feature of the J.P. Morgan fund is that the accounting for the fund is straightforward. Details of the fund are easily transferred to Lufthansa’s treasury management system, which calculates the daily yield. “The service level is good, and we receive statements at the end of each month which we can compare with the automated statements of our treasury system,” says Hashagen. “As the dividends are paid out monthly, the accounting for the accrued interest is very simple.”</p>
<p>Finally, Hashagen is pleased with the yield delivered by the fund in challenging market conditions: “The fund has good performance over EONIA at the moment and the performance of the fund over the last 18 months has been stable above the benchmark. Overall, our use of money market funds is quite sophisticated and we are currently using them for most of our short-term cash.”</p>

"Problem Solved: Linlin Wu, Honeywell (China) Co., Ltd","




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Due to growth in China, Honeywell China decided to look for a US dollar cash pooling arrangement to concentrate the company’s cash balances in the country and reduce external funding costs. After a request for proposal (RFP) process, the company awarded the mandate to Citi for its overall performance based on the scoring matrix designed by Honeywell China.</p>


<h4 class=""fn"">Linlin Wu</h4>
<h5 class=""title"">Treasury Manager</h5>
<img alt=""Honeywell"" class=""logo org"" height=""17"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/honeywell-red-logo-2013-90x17.png"" width=""90""/>

<p>Headquartered in New Jersey in the US, Honeywell International is a Fortune 100 diversified technology and manufacturing leader. The company has a long history in China dating back to 1935, and Honeywell (China) Co., Ltd currently has over 30 legal entities across the country.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>Successful growth efforts in China meant that Honeywell (China) Co., Ltd (Honeywell China) had seen a significant increase in its cash balances. Of this cash balance, 65% was denominated in renminbi and the remaining 35% in US dollars. Honeywell China already had a renminbi pooling system in place, but there was no such arrangement for the US dollar funds, as Linlin Wu, Treasury Manager explains: “Our US dollar cash balances were highly decentralised, with balances being held in various bank accounts with different banks. This made it difficult to get cash visibility as well as the control that we needed from a treasury perspective.”</p>
<p>The proliferation of US dollar accounts resulted largely from the regulatory framework surrounding foreign currency bank accounts in China. For example, cash balances have to be segregated, even if they belong to the same legal entity. Using entrustment loans to manage company cash was ruled out as a viable option as the company considered the arrangements to be cumbersome.</p>
<p>As a result, the company decided to look for a suitable US dollar cash pooling arrangement to concentrate the company’s cash balances in China and reduce external funding costs. “Additionally, we wanted to streamline our banking relationships and leverage our partner bank for tangible bottom line savings and process improvements. It was also important that the US dollar cash balances should be available at short notice in case funds were needed elsewhere within the company,” says Wu.</p>
<p>Since US dollar cash pools are a relatively new product in China, there were no suitable existing structures in place that Honeywell China could replicate. As such, Honeywell treasury defined specific features of the cash pool before sending out an RFP to ensure that the solution would meet both company and regulatory requirements.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>“We invited eight banks to participate in the RFP process – six foreign banks and two local banks – and we set up a two-stage selection process,” explains Wu. Factors that were taken into consideration included: pricing, footprint of the bank, cash pool structure, interest allocation mechanism, e-banking capability as well as system requirements and capability to get central bank clearance. Previous US dollar cash pool experience and the level of service on offer were also important. The final mandate was awarded to Citi for its overall performance based on the scoring matrix designed by Honeywell China.</p>
<p>The solution that was chosen was based on a three-tier automated zero-balancing account (ZBA) entrustment loan structure with participants’ operational accounts in the lowest tier, loan accounts in the second tier and the pool header in the third tier. Using this structure ensures no co-mingling of funds and simplifies interest allocation. Other useful features of the solution include two-leg ZBA sweeping at the end of each day and two-leg reverse sweeping at the beginning of each working day. Implementation work, which was undertaken in three stages, began whilst waiting for regulatory approval from SAFE so that the cash pool could go live shortly after approval was received in August 2008.</p>
<p>Citi’s innovative solution has provided significant benefits to Honeywell China, such as higher investment returns – the proportion of cash actively invested has doubled from 30% to 60%. Other benefits have included: a reduction in bank fees, increased operational efficiencies and enhanced regulatory compliance. In addition, a consolidated overdraft facility and separate payment and collection routes have reduced the administrative burden of monitoring the company’s cash balances in different bank accounts (ie settlement accounts and loan accounts).</p>
<p>As well as providing competitive interest rates (pegged against the USD LIBOR rate), Citi’s solution also gave Honeywell China the scalability of structure required for easy inclusion of new participants into the pool, in particular Honeywell China’s joint ventures (JVs). “As such, the cash pool has a special feature that tracks the aggregated amount contributed by each participating JV and also limits the withdrawal amount of each participating JV to the total of contributions it has made. We have already included one JV into the cash pool and we certainly hope to include more in the future,” concludes Wu.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Corporations operating in China, especially multinational companies such as AB InBev China Co., Ltd (AB InBev China), often find themselves with excess liquidity because of seasonality and the challenges of repatriating funds – which typically limit remittances outside of China to annual or semi-annual dividends.</p>

<p>Headquartered in Belgium, Anheuser Busch InBev (AB InBev) – formed from the merger of Anheuser Busch and InBev in November 2008 – is the number one global brewer and the third largest consumer goods company. AB InBev China has 44 entities including 34 breweries throughout the country and recorded total sales revenue of $1.54 billion in 2008.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>The company began looking for new investment tools to improve the yield on its surplus cash (whilst ensuring safety and liquidity) after the merger at the end of 2008, when integration of the AB and InBev cash pools commenced.</p>
<p>Janet Ming, China Treasury Director, AB InBev China comments, “Overall, we are still at an investment stage in China, so we need money to fund the business. At the same time however, as we have had some operations in China for some time (InBev has been in China since 1984 and AB since 1995), we already have entities making profit.” With the business still expanding, having idle funds was only a temporary arrangement for AB InBev, so the company did not want to put these funds into a long-term investment vehicle.</p>
<p>Finding a suitable investment vehicle for the surplus cash was not entirely straightforward however, as Janet explains: “There are limited options available in China, except for bank deposits. Using time deposits, corporates still need to manage counterparty bank risk as bank deposits are not guaranteed by the government. The other alternative of third party entrustment loans is cumbersome as you need to find a matching counterparty with similar needs in amount and tenor.”</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>With this in mind, and also wanting to diversify the company’s investment instruments, AB InBev China decided to invest into a money market fund (MMF). As the only AAA-rated RMB money market fund available in China, the CIFM RMB MMF was the obvious choice for the company.</p>
<p>“The fund has a very good track record and an excellent credit rating,” remarks Janet. “Other benefits of the fund are that it offers T+1 liquidity with greater flexibility than bank deposits. In addition, interest earned on bank deposits is subject to corporate income tax in China – which is normally 25% – whereas dividends paid by money market funds are exempt from corporate income tax.”</p>
<p>The sponsor for the CIFM RMB MMF is the China International Fund Management Company, a joint venture between J.P. Morgan Asset Management and Shanghai International Trust and Investment Co., Ltd. The primary objective of the fund is security of principal, the second is liquidity and the third is yield. “We have an excellent relationship with J.P. Morgan globally,” says Janet. “They were the lead arranger for the merger and their strategy is different from other foreign banks in the space. They are very focused on the investment side of the business and investing in the fund has allowed us to set up a real business connection with the bank in China.”</p>
<p>Investing in the fund was a simple move for the company. “The account opening and daily management processes relating to the fund are quite straightforward – not complicated at all,” says Janet. “Before the account was opened, we were given a whole list of the required documentation and an explanation as to how to fill in each form, which we found very considerate.”</p>
<p>The CIFM RMB MMF has proven to be a good liquidity tool for the company, whilst also allowing for improved investment return. As the integration of the two cash pools continues, the company will have an increased need for an effective tool to manage surplus cash and AB InBev China expects to invest further into the fund in the future.</p>

"Problem Solved: Ildikó Gyurján, Suzuki","




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Hungary’s Suzuki car manufacturing is focused on exporting to other countries in the CEE. In order to optimise liquidity management, Hungarian banking partner K&amp;H Bank (a member of the KBC Group), proposed opening a foreign revenue collection account in Slovakia together with the introduction of an international zero balancing cash pool for Suzuki.</p>


<h4 class=""fn"">Ildikó Gyurján</h4>
<h5 class=""title"">Deputy CFO</h5>
<img alt=""Suzuki"" class=""logo org"" height=""61"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/suzuki-logo-2009-50x61.png"" width=""50""/>

<p>Suzuki is the 12<sup>th</sup> largest passenger car manufacturer in the world, employing more than 45,000 people across 163 countries. Production in Hungary started in 1992 and annual production capacity reached 280,000 vehicles in 2008. The company’s domestic market share is around 18% and Suzuki has led the new car sales list for 12 consecutive years. Almost 3% of the entire export volume of the Hungarian economy is produced by Magyar Suzuki Corporation.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>The driving force behind Hungary’s Suzuki car manufacturing is export. As such, it is extremely important – in terms of the company’s liquidity management – that the revenue from cars sold is sent from the foreign dealers to the Hungarian financial centre’s account as soon as possible. Foreign partners usually pay for the vehicles through international funds transfer, so payment takes at least two days. The revenues could only be received earlier if the transfer costs were increased; however, dealers would not be ready to pay these higher costs.</p>
<p>In recent years, Suzuki’s export turnover has achieved a notable increase in Slovakia, so it is in this country where we tried to find a solution to this problem first of all.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>After reviewing our needs, our Hungarian banking partner K&amp;H Bank (a member of the <strong>KBC Group</strong>), proposed opening a foreign revenue collection account in Slovakia together with the introduction of an international zero balancing cash pool for Suzuki.</p>
<p>When implementing this solution, we asked the Slovakian Suzuki dealer network to use this collection account managed by CSOB –the local member of the KBC Group – for the payment of vehicles instead of using international transfers as they had done previously.This solution has proven to be extremely advantageous for the dealers because they can settle their accounts payable through cheaper domestic transfers instead of costly international transfers. It also takes less time to make a domestic transfer: where the dealers have accounts at CSOB, the money is credited to Suzuki’s account on the same day, and where accounts are held at other banks, funds are credited on the next day.</p>
<p>As a second step, it was important to ensure that the amount credited to the Slovakian collection account was transferred to the Hungarian central account as soon as possible, since export revenues are utilised where the goods are produced. In order to facilitate this, we introduced the international zero balancing cash pool service. The international cash pool is available for accounts managed in the same currency. In the case of Suzuki, transfers were performed between Hungary and Slovakia in Slovakian koruna until 31<sup>st</sup> December 2008, then in euro after the country’s admission to the Eurozone at the beginning of 2009.<p>
<p>The introduction of the international cash pool system means that the full end-of-day balance managed at the Slovakian account is transferred to our account in Hungary every day without submitting separate transfer orders each time. The banks performing the zero balancing transactions are all members of the KBC Group and, as such, there is no value date loss for Suzuki. In practice, this means that an amount paid by a foreign partner on Monday (D) is available in the Hungarian account, managed at K&amp;H Bank, by Tuesday morning (D+1), and the amount transferred is included in the previous day’s value account balance (D).</p>
<p>Movements of funds on the foreign account are monitored electronically using the KBC Group’s internet-based software (w1secorporate e-banking). This system makes it possible to keep a record of the amounts received from partners and the cash pool transfers. The w1se software is able to manage several accounts across various banks, so after a while our revenue collection account in Romania was also linked to the system, allowing further development of extended high-quality services.</p>
<p>As external financing costs have increased during the past year, it is extremely important to ensure that the liquidity management of the various countries is performed centrally. The international cash pool product and the w1se electronic account management system are excellent for this purpose as their introduction enables us to plan our revenues more efficiently and, all in all, mean cost savings for Suzuki.</p>

<img alt=""Atlas Copco"" class=""logo org"" height=""43"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/atlas-copco-logo-2009-90x43.png"" width=""90""/>

<p>Established in Sweden in 1873, Atlas Copco is the world leader in compressed air and gas equipment, generators, construction and mining equipment, industrial tools and assembly systems. The group reported revenues of €7.7 billion in 2008 and has over 34,000 employees worldwide. Atlas Copco entered the Chinese market in the 1920s and now has 19 entities located across eight cities in China.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>Having acquired a number of entities during the company’s history in China, the treasury structure at Atlas Copco (China) had become extremely decentralised. This legacy structure was making it difficult to ensure the best use of company cash and to keep track of group cash positions efficiently.</p>
<p>Audrey Deng, Manager, Group Treasury Asia Pacific, explains: “We had more than 15 entities in different cities throughout China. We were operating using an entrusted loan facility, through which cash rich companies could fund the cash poor companies. However, it was not possible to do this automatically and it could only be done on a deal-by-deal basis, which meant a lot of administrative work. We also wanted to improve group visibility.”</p>
<p>In order to achieve this, Atlas Copco (China) wanted a solution that would have strong interfacing capabilities with a range of ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems, as there was virtually no integration between the existing entities’ various ERP systems. In addition, Deng says: “Each entity had its own payment and collection accounts with different banks, some with local banks and some with international banks. So we dealt with all kinds of banking partners and paid different fees, which was quite complicated.”</p>
<p>A more streamlined solution was, therefore, required.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>With this in mind, the company looked into setting up an RMB cash pool that would not only meet all its requirements but also centralise group operations and consolidate banking relationships. As an additional challenge, all this had to be achieved within a three-month implementation timeframe because Atlas Copco (China) wanted to have the cash pool in place as early as possible and completed before quarter-end closing. “We sent out RFPs and six banks gave us proposals,” comments Deng. “Then we evaluated and judged the proposals one by one and conducted a cost-benefit analysis. We shortlisted some of the banks and carried out a thorough customer reference check, whereby we asked for a few references from each bank. This was not included in the three-month implementation timeframe, of course.</p>
<p>“Although the main reason we chose Deutsche Bank was that their solution was a perfect fit to our requirements, I think dealing with a bank has to have some kind of personal element to it. No matter how good its service level looks on paper, this must be realised by the bank employees. Throughout the process, Deutsche Bank’s professionalism, efficiency and level of service really impressed me.”</p>
<p>The RMB cash pool that was proposed and set up by Deutsche Bank is a fully automated bespoke solution with pan-China cash sweeping using entrusted loans. “It has some innovative options such as sweeping reversal, maximum cover limit and interest allocation,” says Deng. The solution also includes straight-through processing capabilities for payments and collections, and the host-to-host connection with CNAPS (China National Advanced Payment System) facilitates extremely quick processing times. Through this solution, Atlas Copco (China) has been able to achieve RMB liquidity optimisation and cost reductions, as well as improved cash visibility and enhanced end-to-end processing efficiency.</p>
<p>In terms of the implementation, one of the main challenges was the variety of ERP systems in use across the company’s different entities. Deutsche Bank’s electronic banking platform, db-direct internet, enabled the company to overcome this hurdle as the platform offers universal ERP integration. Deng adds: “We can run a payment through our ERP system and it is automatically uploaded to db-direct internet.” The other main challenge was the three-month implementation timeframe. “Before we started, someone at the company said ‘We can never finish this within three months’, but we did – we made it,” says Deng. “Of course, Deutsche Bank helped us a lot; they showed their commitment to the project. They are definitely result-orientated people.”</p>
<p>Since setting up the RMB cash pool in 2008, Atlas Copco (China) has established two additional entities, one of which has been incorporated seamlessly into the cash pool with the other to follow in the near future.</p>

<img alt=""adidas"" class=""logo org"" height=""39"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/adidas-logo-2009-60x39.png"" width=""60""/>

<p>Sporting goods manufacturer adidas is headquartered in Germany and operates 150 subsidiaries globally. The group reported net sales of €10.3 billion in 2007 and has over 31,000 employees worldwide. adidas began operating in China in the 1990s and now operates 5,000 shops in Greater China.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>Regulatory restrictions in China mean that the options for repatriating cash out of the country are limited. adidas China holds a large amount of surplus cash in China which can only be repatriated to the headquarters in the form of dividends. “I can only remit dividends once a year, and that’s generally about six months after the close of the fiscal year,” explains Erick Haskell, CFO of adidas Greater China. “So basically that means you have 18 months’ worth of accumulated profits that you can’t remit.”</p>
<p>The surplus cash used to be invested in time deposits for a fixed period of 30 or more days but the resulting yield was small. “As the business grew and the amount of surplus cash got bigger there was pressure from our headquarters that if we couldn’t remit, we needed to be in search of better yield,” says Haskell.</p>
<p>Initially, Haskell investigated the option of investing the surplus cash into money market funds. However, although the money market funds were far more liquid than time deposits, the yield was not significantly higher. Accordingly, Haskell decided to explore the option of lending funds to other companies using third-party entrustment loans.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>As direct inter-company lending is prohibited in China, it must be achieved using entrustment loans (also known as entrust or entrusted loans) using a bank as an intermediary. Third-party entrustment loans are a variation of this model, whereby one company with surplus cash can lend that cash to another company. Two banks are involved in this model: the agent bank, which holds the funds and completes the transaction, and the guarantor bank, which guarantees the loan in case the borrowing company defaults. For regulatory reasons the agent and guarantor banks must be two different banks.</p>
<p>adidas has a sizeable long-term relationship with Standard Chartered Bank, both in China and on a global level. “When we decided to seek these sort of yield enhancing opportunities, the natural thing was to turn to Standard Chartered as one of our big banking partners to ask what opportunities were out there,” recalls Haskell. “So we started a discussion about doing third-party entrustment loans and not long after that, Standard Chartered introduced us to our first client.” Although counterparty exposure limits set by adidas’ headquarters require adidas to work with a number of banks, Standard Chartered has continued to play a key role in the project, acting as the agent bank for some loans and as the guarantor bank for others.</p>
<p>The launch of the third-party entrustment loans programme in mid-2007 was well timed. At the end of 2007, concerned that the economy was overheating, the Chinese government restricted bank lending. As a result, demand for third-party entrustment loans dramatically increased.</p>
<p>This also enabled adidas to charge a higher interest rate on its loans. The rate for third-party entrusted loans is agreed bilaterally between the lender and borrower. Whereas initially the rate of interest tended to be halfway between the lender’s deposit rate and the borrower’s cost of borrowing, at the height of the credit crunch adidas was able to charge interest at the same rate as the banks, or even higher. “It was great for me – I was getting a very good yield,” says Haskell. “And it was great for the companies we were lending to, because they were getting access to funds that they couldn’t otherwise obtain.”</p>
<p>Haskell hopes that a relaxation of capital controls in China will one day make it easier to remit surplus cash overseas. In the meantime, the project is likely to expand. “I’ve found that from a risk return standpoint, this is the best vehicle I have for deploying excess cash. Particularly now that we’ve got quite good at it, the administrative burden is low. The third-party entrustment loans have taken up an increasing part of our excess cash and I see this continuing in the future.”</p>

<p>OPG consists of several decentralised entities in Central Europe with substantial operational autonomy in the day-to-day organisation of their businesses.</p>

<img alt=""Orco Property Group"" class=""logo org"" height=""32"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/orco-property-group-logo-2008-70x32.png"" width=""70""/>

<p>A leading investor, developer and asset manager in the Central European real estate and hospitality market, Orco Property Group (OPG) currently has assets under management of €2.7 billion. Based in Luxembourg, OPG is a public company which has been operating in Central Europe since 1991 and employs over 3,100 people in nine different countries worldwide.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>The majority of the group’s turnover is realised in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Germany and Poland. Cash flows are in euro and in local currency. The parent company, which is responsible for the group treasury, is based in Luxembourg.</p>
<p>“We needed to find an efficient single e-banking platform which would allow us to simplify our bank account structure and optimise the cash flows within the group,” says Bruno Bobricheff, Group Treasurer. Local payments and receivables are the responsibility of the local entities so each affiliate needed to have electronic access to bank statements for its own account(s) only and the ability to initiate electronic payments from those accounts only.</p>
<p>Group treasury, meanwhile, wanted to achieve better control and oversight of the different entities’ funds and to maintain electronic access to all accounts centrally in order to achieve greater visibility and security in the enterprise-wide cash position. “We also needed group treasury to be able to initiate payments out of the local accounts. So we were looking for a uniform solution for the group’s entities and one that would support both local and international payment formats,” adds Bobricheff.</p>
<p>In order to concentrate the cash flow and benefit from potential economies of scale, OPG was also looking to set up centralised cash pooling. Bobricheff wanted the structure to run without value date loss and with a maximum level of automation to reduce the numerous manual transfers.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>Bearing in mind these objectives as well as the group’s geographical footprint, OPG opted for the cash management solution proposed by KBC. A cash management adviser was then appointed to co-ordinate the installation of the solution. A team of specialists in account opening, reporting, e-banking and cash pooling was dedicated to the implementation. In conjunction with this team, OPG was able to establish a staged process for implementing the new system which consisted of reviewing the account structure, rolling out the e-banking solution and setting up the cross-border zero balancing.</p>
<p>The local operational accounts of OPG in Central Europe were screened and reduced. Remaining accounts were moved to KBC and some local third-party banks. Group treasury opened ‘overlay’ accounts with KBC in Belgium, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland and Germany. The accounts were opened in euro and in local currency as non-resident accounts, with the master accounts being held in Belgium.</p>
<p>“KBC Bank offered a state-of-the-art internet solution, called w1se corporate e-banking,” says Bobricheff. This multi-country, multi-language, e-banking software enables OPG to manage its accounts worldwide. It also allows group treasury in Luxembourg to remit payment and collection instructions and to withdraw intraday and/or end-of-day account information from whichever location. “Group treasury requested that the local entities install w1se so they could also easily and electronically approve all the different payments they initiated,” comments Bobricheff.</p>
<p>Local collections and/or payments are credited /debited on the relevant account with the local KBC or third-party banks in the different countries. OPG opted for a cross-border zero balancing system to a master account (per currency) held at KBC Belgium. The participating accounts are held at CSOB Czech Republic, CSOB Slovakia and K&amp;H Bank Hungary.</p>
<p>OPG’s accounts at Kredyt Bank Poland and at KBC Germany are not yet integrated in the automated cash pool due to limited but growing turnover, but these accounts are also conveniently managed through w1se. “KBC helped OPG to solve its issues in a cost efficient way with its easy to use and very reliable e-banking platform and cash pooling structure, therefore I would strongly recommend my treasury peers to consider these two solutions developed by KBC,” comments Bobricheff.</p>

<p>The UK-based Fujitsu Services Pensions Administration team manages three individual pension funds and a Common Investment Fund.</p>

<img alt=""Fujitsu"" class=""logo org"" height=""30"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/fujitsu-logo-2008-62x30.png"" width=""62""/>

<p>Fujitsu Services designs, builds and operates IT solutions and services for customers in Europe, Middle East and Africa. Fujitsu Services is part of Fujitsu, which operates in 70 countries and employs 160,000 staff worldwide.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>The pensions administration system database receives data from AVCs (additional voluntary contributions), pension fund providers, the Department of Work and Pensions, and the Fujitsu Services HR and Payroll systems, which is then used to perform calculations and generate payments and receipts for each pension scheme.</p>
<p>The existing solution and end-to-end pensions accounting processes were robust and had received outstanding audit reports and commentary. The problem that confronted Fujitsu related to the ageing legacy system used to carry out the cash management and pension fund accounting. As a result, the Fujitsu Services pensions trustees initiated a project to review, update and streamline the pension fund cash management and accounting processes, which included pension accounting, payment processing, reporting and accruals, investments and management reporting. Much of this was carried out using spreadsheets.</p>
<p>“The cash management process for the pensions administration function was highly manual and the trustees therefore required a solution that would eliminate the requirement to re-key financial data and systemise processes, providing a clear audit trail,” says Susan Wedgbury, Treasury Systems and Back-Office Manager of Fujitsu Services. It was also hoped that the new solution would eliminate dependence on spreadsheets, provide capacity for expansion and enable the automated production of key financial statements and reports for review by the trustees.</p>
<p>The chosen solution would also need to ensure the complete segregation of pension data from corporate treasury data, to comply with the rigid requirements of the Pensions Regulator. In compliance with these regulations, the Fujitsu Services Treasury team does not perform any pension administration activities, or provide any cash management or accounting services to the pensions trustees.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>Accordingly, the pensions trustees decided to replace the existing manual cash management solution with a proven and secure treasury management system. “Our search focused on the IT2 treasury management system, which is used by the Fujitsu Services Limited corporate treasury in Slough, UK,” says Wedgbury. “Fujitsu Services corporate treasury had been using IT2 productively for about six years when the pension funds automation project took place in 2007. Therefore the treasury team had a strong understanding of IT2’s capabilities to deliver a best practice STP solution for a treasury’s cash management, accounting and risk management requirements.”</p>
<p>In order to ensure the segregation of corporate treasury and pension data, data access profiles were created in IT2 for both organisations. Each IT2 user was then assigned the appropriate data access profile. “IT2 enjoys the technical and reporting efficiency benefits of being based on a single central system and database; but the system can be configured through standard implementation processes so that it is fully partitioned where required,” says Wedgbury. “Once set up, IT2 can prevent staff in one treasury centre viewing, editing, or deleting items belonging to another (including transactions, counterparties and bank account records). For Fujitsu, this ensures that treasury personnel cannot access, view or process pensions data – and vice-versa – as required.” Pension funds cash accounting is now fully operational at Fujitsu Services.</p>
<p>One of the main highlights of the IT2 solution is that IT2 has the power and flexibility to support four different accounting frameworks for the three pension schemes and the Common Investment Fund operated by Fujitsu Services. This enables the required management reporting to be generated accurately for the 14 investment managers, through an efficient, automated process. The IT2 solution is also expandable, allowing for additional pension funds to be added as required, and the solution automatically posts all the required accrual accounting entries and reports. Finally, IT2’s flexible workbench and reporting functionalities have enabled the elimination of spreadsheets in the production of quarterly and annual reports to the pensions trustees.</p>
<p>IT2 is presently working on some additional checks on the file import process, and adjusting the journal reversal process. Future enhancements will allow for the fully automated creation of cash postings and journal entries from the pension administration database. These will update the IT2 cashbook and the IT2 Nominal Ledger – an integral IT2 module – eliminating the inefficiencies, error potential and costs of having to re-key the data into a separate accounting system. IT2 automatic bank account reconciliation will then be used to reconcile pension fund bank account information to the cashbook entries.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>“Bucher’s treasury operation was experiencing a range of inefficiencies in the areas of cash and FX management, as a consequence of using technology that had become outdated,” explains Mauro D’Ambros, Treasurer of Bucher.</p>

<img alt=""Bucher"" class=""logo org"" height=""17"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/bucher-logo-2008-90x17.png"" width=""90""/>

<p>Bucher Industries is a global technology group, based in Niederweningen, in the Zürich canton of Switzerland. Bucher holds leading market positions in the speciality areas of mechanical and vehicle engineering. The company’s operations currently include specialised agricultural machinery, municipal vehicles, wine and fruit juice production equipment, hydraulic components and manufacturing equipment for the glass container industry. In fiscal 2007 Bucher generated CHF 2.5 billion in sales.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>“On the cash management side, our daily procedure involved merging uploaded cash pool balances with treasury deal maturity reports from our legacy TMS, in Excel. The resulting report was incomplete and required manual reconciliation, research, correction and removal of duplicates – as well as the application of intraday bank statement updates – to produce a cash position, which was eventually used as the basis for telephone dealing. The treasury was unable to perform timely bank account reconciliation – any late payment of funds was only detected a few days later, and we were unable to request any entitlement to value date correction. The process was time-consuming, labour intensive, inefficient and error prone – and was wasteful in terms of interest income/expense management.</p>
<p>In terms of foreign exchange, if a Bucher entity needed to make an FX deal to cover a commercial exposure, they would telephone or email central treasury with their order. Treasury would deal externally, and we would then have to enter the external and internal deals manually, as the system did not support deal mirroring. The front office would next print three confirmations for each deal: one would be sent to the back office for settlement, one would be filed numerically, and the third copy would be filed by value date. In addition, the internal deal confirmation was faxed to the Bucher entity who originated the transaction.</p>
<p>Deal maturity management was also cumbersome. Front office would initiate the process from the filed confirmations, and would instruct the back office to make the necessary payment. Back office would check the request, perform any necessary research, and then initiate the payment using manual entry into the online banking system. This paper-based process required front and back office signatures, and was a further source of operating inefficiencies.”</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>“Bucher’s Finance Management decided that operational efficiency could only be upgraded to a desirable level by implementing a modern TMS. Accordingly, treasury executed a thorough system selection process, and chose IT2 to provide a best practice solution for cash and treasury operations management. IT2 impressed Bucher with its look and feel, its structure and its unique process mapping facilities, which enable treasury to comply easily and effectively with ICS (Internal Control System – the Swiss equivalent of Sarbanes-Oxley).</p>
<p>Bucher treasury now uses a robust process in which SWIFT MT940 messages are automatically uploaded into an IT2 folder from the Fides service, via an FTP server. An IT2 ‘job’ automatically scans the folder twice daily, to import intraday updates. IT2 automatically reconciles projected versus reported items, and the Bucher treasury back office researches, corrects and manually matches any un-reconciled items. Reconciliation is now a much more assured and less troublesome process.</p>
<p>IT2 automatically integrates information about new and maturing treasury transactions, so that an accurate real time cash position is available to the treasury team – who can focus completely on analysing, planning and executing the required dealing operations, as opposed to being occupied with the details of cumbersome (and effectively unproductive) data processing operations.</p>
<p>Bucher’s front office uses the IT2 Position Analysis Workbench to review the real time cash position, and then deals in the market either electronically using the 360T dealing portal, or by phone, depending on the counterparty.</p>
<p>With IT2, Bucher has implemented a secure end-to-end STP dealing process. 360T deals are automatically downloaded into IT2. After verification in IT2, deals are automatically uploaded into the Misys Treasury Plus portal for confirmation issuance and matching. After deals have been matched in Misys, they are saved in a folder on a server, which is scanned by IT2 24/7; as soon as a new file is detected, it is imported into IT2 and the status of the deal is set to matched. IT2 initiates and monitors the settlement process. Completed transactions are archived in the IT2 database for audit purposes.</p>
<p>The entire dealing process now executes in less than five minutes, which represents substantial gains in efficiency, accuracy and control. The next stage is to roll-out the IT2 NET module to our subsidiary network. IT2 NET provides 24/7 web based communications between a global network of operating subsidiaries and central treasury. This will extend our IT2 solution to automate the transmission of cash forecasts and deal requests, and the related reporting. We are pleased to have streamlined our treasury processes so that we can now focus on our professional tasks in today’s demanding market environment.”</p>

"Problem Solved: Scott M Miller, Henkel","




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Henkel’s global operations was based in several locations and it needed a system to tackle its overall collections needs as well as provide real time visibility into data. The company implemented AvantGard Receivables, which offered increased control and an automated approach to collections, as well as sophisticated cash reporting abilities.</p>


<h4 class=""fn"">Scott M Miller</h4>
<h5 class=""title"">Vice President of Finance, Order-to-Cash</h5>
<img alt=""Henkel"" class=""logo org"" height=""33"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/henkel-logo-2008-60x33.png"" width=""60""/>

<p>Headquartered in Germany, Henkel is a manufacturing and technology company that is organised into three operating sectors: laundry and homecare products, cosmetics and toiletries, and adhesive technologies. The company employs approximately 52,000 people worldwide and utilises shared service centres (SSCs) located in Connecticut (USA) and Manila (Philippines), which are responsible for managing its North American business activities. Henkel services approximately 30,000 customers in North America alone.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>As a global organisation with a number of different operating locations, Henkel found that it was unable to gain the visibility it desired into key information, such as that required to perform cash forecasting and risk analysis surrounding the order-to-cash cycle. Credit operations information was located in 15 disparate systems and credit and collections employees were therefore receiving a disjointed view of data and customers. In turn, this hindered the efficiency and accuracy rates at which transactions could be processed and settled.</p>
<p>Henkel’s credit and collections processes were entirely manual, increasing the likelihood of costly inaccuracies. The processing of data by hand also required the attention of a large number of staff and monopolised time that could have been spent supporting more goal and revenue-driven activities.</p>
<p>Henkel reached an impasse where business growth could not be efficiently facilitated without employing further staff to process the increasing volume of transactions. As the company did not have the level of detail or real-time view of information that it needed to make the best possible business decisions or to forecast as precisely as desired, it became clear that reporting also needed to be improved. Henkel therefore decided to look for an automated system to improve the operational efficiency around the order-to-cash cycle within its North American SSCs.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>The company went through an in-depth analysis of available vendors, taking into consideration its own functional and technical guidelines. Henkel’s requirements included: a quick implementation timeframe that would not interfere with ‘business-as-usual’ activities, seamless integration with its ERP system, process automation, real-time visibility into data, a consistent approach to collections, significant ROI and lastly, sophisticated reporting capabilities.</p>
<p>Henkel chose SunGard as its provider because the vendor proved most capable of precisely accommodating the organisation’s overall collections needs. Following a thorough evaluation of Henkel’s business situation, SunGard implemented AvantGard Receivables to offer the company increased control and an automated approach to managing accounts receivable, as well as a centralised repository for data storage and manipulation. The benefits that the AvantGard solution has offered Henkel include: improved productivity via automation and workflow integration, increased visibility into data surrounding the order-to-cash cycle, a centralised location for data to be stored and controlled, scalability to handle large transaction volumes and workflow controls for duty segregation.</p>
<p>Thus far, Henkel has experienced considerable improvements in receivables management, perhaps the most significant of these being increased cash flow stemming from enhanced visibility and control over credit and collections data. “With the help of the AvantGard Receivables solution, we have been able to measurably improve our productivity through centralising our credit and collections operations”, comments Miller. Reporting was another area that Henkel hoped to develop and with the help of AvantGard, the goal of gaining exceptional reporting capabilities has been attained, improving the organisations forecasting and providing root cause analysis.</p>
<p>Another of the solution’s benefits is its ability to improve productivity throughout the order-to-cash cycle. This has been accomplished through automation of processes that had previously been performed manually, as well as the added benefit of increased levels of collaboration across the enterprise. Various business units and departments are now communicating better, enabling employees to gain a clearer sense of the bigger picture. Miller concludes: “Adopting automated technology has allowed for increased efficiency in processes surrounding the order-to-cash cycle, as well as invaluable tracking and reporting capabilities that have provided us with an enhanced means of forecasting and monitoring financial trends.”</p>
<p>The AvantGard Receivables solution is currently used in Henkel of America’s shared service centre (SSC) and the company anticipates expanding its usage to the European SSC in the near future. Henkel was pleased with the implementation, including the swiftness with which the solution was up and running, as well as the expertise demonstrated by SunGard staff. AvantGard Receivables Dashboard, which assists companies in measuring key performance indicators, is due to be rolled out in the North America SSC in the coming months.</p>

<img alt=""Würth"" class=""logo org"" height=""39"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/wurth-logo-2008-60x39.png"" width=""60""/>

<p>Würth Group started as a family business that has grown to a trading group of 420 companies in 86 countries. Würth Group’s core business is the trade of fastening and assembling materials such as screws, screw accessories, dowels, plugs, furniture and construction fittings and stock-keeping and picking systems. In 2007 the Group, which employs 65,000 people and is headquartered from Künzelsau in Germany, generated a turnover of €8.49 billion.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>Würth’s treasury and payment processes are not currently centralised. While a shared service centre provides payment services to the majority of the group’s German domestic subsidiaries, a lot of other international network companies use the services of a payment factory operated by Würth Finance International B.V. in Switzerland.</p>
<p>The German headquarters manages payments for approximately 60 subsidiaries and nearly 200 bank accounts with 18 different banks. Payments are initiated either directly in the company’s SAP system or, in the case of urgent payments, via partially integrated electronic banking software.</p>
<p>The new solution had to meet the company’s compliance requirements and raise the level of automation and straight through processing. “Automation is a major issue for us as we have to handle approximately 200 outgoing files and 15,000 incoming payments per day,” says Claus Wild, Project Manager at Würth. “The faster processing of payments represents a competitive advantage for the group. If, for example, a customer with a high dunning level (ie a customer we are already chasing for overdue payment) orders new materials and we have not received or reconciled the payment for a previous order we will not be able, for credit risk reasons, to process the new order until the payment is received. As a consequence, there is a risk that the customer may place the order with one of our competitors.”</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>After evaluating all the available solutions appropriate for a company of its size, Würth opted for a SWIFT connection in combination with SAP’s new application (Bank Communication Management). The Bank Communication Management application enables the company to link its ERP system directly to all relationship banks through one single interface.</p>
<p>Wild views the new payment solution and SWIFT connection as a long-term investment. “Over the past decade we had to update the software used in our payment processes five or six times, which has been comparatively expensive in terms of new interfaces and overall time and costs. We therefore decided to undertake a major investment in our payment processes in order to be positioned for the future,” he explains. “With SWIFT’s FileAct or FIN messages we are no longer bound by country specifications or by our software.”</p>
<p>Würth is connected to SWIFT via a MA-CUG (Member Administered Closed User Group) provided by Commerzbank. The selection of the bank was critical for the success of the project and the solution’s timely implementation. “If you start a large project it is necessary to have clearly assigned responsibilities and a dedicated account manager. The long-standing, reliable relationship that we have with Commerzbank – I have been working with the same relationship manager for 14 years now – was certainly a reason that worked in the bank’s favour,” states Wild. “Moreover, Commerzbank is in our opinion very well positioned in terms of technology and innovation in payments and cash management. We counted on the bank’s know-how and experience.”</p>
<p>The company decided to host the necessary infrastructure and software for the SWIFT connection in-house and relied on the close co-operation of its partners – Commerzbank, SAP, CSC Germany (Computer Sciences Corporation Germany) and SWIFT – for the implementation of the different components of the solution. The implementation itself was smooth. “Despite the complexity of the project and a tight schedule, the co-operation between our partners and ourselves was so excellent that we were able to realise the project targets within the planned timescale,” recalls Wild. “Surprisingly we also had practically no issues with the implementation.”</p>
<p>In January 2008, Würth became one of Commerzbank’s first customers to effect the new SEPA credit transfer, generating the payment message in its ERP system and sending it to the bank via a SWIFT connection. Once the solution has been rolled out to the subsidiaries, the company will in time be able to reduce the large number of bank interfaces, ultimately using only the SWIFT connection for all payments. In addition, the accelerated information flow gives Würth new opportunities to consolidate bank statements and improve liquidity management.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>In 2005, VWIF was confronted with a problem: out of the blue, the IFRS Board introduced higher demands on the calculation and documentation of financial hedging instruments, which had to be adopted at short notice. VW Head Office communicated this urgent requirement to its subsidiaries. Our objective at VWIF was to implement hedge accounting by year end.</p>

<p>Based in Amsterdam, the role of Volkswagen International Finance NV (‘VWIF’) is to finance Volkswagen’s corporate operations using a range of funding actions in the international capital markets. VWIF performs extensive inter-company lending/borrowing operations to execute funding distribution to the various VW companies. All funding positions are fair value hedged, via interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>“Many will recall the lack of clarity that accompanied the early days of the announcement of IAS39. The IFRS Board issued a series of high level directives but these lacked practical detail on how to implement a solution. Compliance requirements involved an innovative combination of accounting and risk management, posing new problems for treasury accountants and treasury technologists. The earlier implementation of FAS133 in the United States was not totally helpful, as there were material differences between FAS133 and IAS39 compliance.</p>
<p>“At VWIF, we naturally turned to the accounting profession for advice and guidance, but some of the advice we received was ambiguous and quite confusing. Members of our treasury peer group reported a similar situation. Opinions varied dramatically between audit firms over what were, or were not, IAS39 compliant hedge accounting solutions – even between different branches of the same audit firm! The situation was very fluid, as opinion evolved – and sometimes entirely changed direction.</p>
<p>“Our own compliance issues were compounded in several ways. The dollar offset method used to assess hedge effectiveness would not work at VWIF as this method, as is now well known, falls short when there is a small deviation in fair value between exposures and their hedges – the results are mathematically amplified to produce non-compliance. At VWIF, we needed to implement regression analysis to achieve IAS39 compliance. A further complication for us was our heavy use of cross-currency interest rate swaps. The issue here was the accurate translation of change in fair value in one currency into the correct spread for another.</p>
<p>“Our mission at VWIF was to complete a very demanding and visible project in a very tight timeline. Fourteen VW companies decided to use the hedge accounting reporting service that we were developing.”</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>“After analysing various systems in use at VW, we chose IT2 to deliver the hedge accounting solution. We had been using IT2 for cash and treasury management for many years. In practice, we found that the technology companies were confronted with the same issues of interpretation as we were and they needed to deliver generic solutions to satisfy a range of requirement details as demanded by their client base. It was very hard work for all of us, with IT2 product management, development and professional services all involved, and having to cope with requirement changes on the way. IT2 provided a working regression solution, which fulfilled our central requirement. The solution went live in the first week of December 2005.</p>
<p>“In outline, the exposures are sent to VWIF from the central SAP system. IT2 derives the results, which are either sent to Sun Accounts for VWIF, or are reported to the companies. IT2 performs and reports on hedge effectiveness both retrospectively and prospectively as required. Our management reporting is simple: we use an IT2 report to show that our hedge relationships are all compliant. The purpose of this exercise is simply to provide transparent proof that hedge accounting is properly and effectively implemented at VWIF. An additional benefit is control over credit exposures, so that Volkswagen’s corporate credit policy is seen to be properly applied.</p>
<p>“In retrospect, things might have been easier if we had declined to proceed with the project until we were confident that we had a clear and stable specification, but perhaps we would have missed our deadline if we had adopted this approach. We are now in the rather unexpected position of being providers of a hedge accounting solution to 14 demanding clients, rather than just being users of IT2.</p>
<p>“The situation – at least with IAS39 compliance – is now quiet, and hedge accounting has settled in as a background process in our operations. We hope that will remain the case, but who knows what the IFRS Board might rule in the future?”</p>

<p>“We were looking for a solution to help us optimise the handling of our outbound documentary collections and streamline our receivables processing,” explain Leopoldo V. Saboya, Corporate Financial Manager of Perdigão S.A., and International Operations Manager Erwin Marcos L. Bozsa.</p>
<p>“The company had grown very fast, particularly the volume of our exports. As a result, we needed to restructure our operations team and implement new systems in order to handle the increase in purchase orders coming in from all over the world.</p>
<p>“Moreover, we needed to find local banks with expertise in documentary trade services, since most of our exports are through documentary collections. Our goal was to reduce the administrative burden for all parties involved – Perdigão, the remitting bank and the collecting bank – without losing control over the documentation (and hence our title to the goods), as well as streamlining receivables processing. Any cost savings are most welcome in our business, as we operate within very tight margins and warehousing and demurrage are very expensive.”</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>Many different banks were able to offer Perdigão a standard documentary export collection service. “What was different about Santander Brazil, and their Trade Services’ solution-orientated team, is that they offered an innovative yet customised service,” says Marcos. “We can see that Santander is expanding as a global player, with its foundations firmly in its core markets of Europe and Latin America, and supporting its clients’ business in Asia, the Middle East and other emerging markets – the same markets to which Perdigão is now exporting.”</p>
<p>The solution offered by 5an61nder Brazil is based on a documentary trade servic5 known as D61ect Documentary Collection. This service enables Perdigão to send documentary collections from its offices directly to Santander’s network of collecting banks, reducing document transit times without losing any control over payment or documentation logistics.</p>
<p>As Marcos explains, “All Perdigão has to do is send an electronic file to Santander Brazil including the terms and conditions mentioned in the collection. Every time we enter a purchase order into our system, it automatically generates a collection with Santander Brazil’s letter heading. Santander Brazil is able to handle Perdigão’s own file format and we avoid any re-keying for our operations team, since only one data input is required to update our systems and generate the collection.</p>
<p>“Throughout this initiative we have worked closely with Santander Brazil to enable the smart use of web-based technologies to streamline processes, minimise turnaround times and cut costs. Indeed, this solution has allowed us to save at least two days of document transit time, since no hard copies or original shipping documents need to be sent via the remitting bank.”</p>
<p>Several stages were involved in the development of the solution. Firstly, all paperwork was replaced by electronic communication between Perdigão and Santander Brazil, significantly improving control, tracking, security and turnaround times. Reconciliation was then enhanced and comprehensive reports developed to enable the smooth processing of high volumes of collections. Meanwhile, a dedicated Santander customer service team was allocated to support Perdigão’s requirements. An account was also opened in New York to facilitate the smooth flow of international receivables.</p>
<p>The complete solution includes the servicing of documentary export collections, reconciliation, reporting and a collection account for receivables proceeds, as well as a dedicated support team within Santander Brazil.</p>
<p>Leopoldo and Marcos feel that Santander Brazil has helped Perdigão to achieve considerable savings in processing costs, as well as reducing its Days Sales Outstanding and improving its cash flow and working capital requirements. “The solution provides us with a robust platform to support the continued international expansion of our business.”</p>

<p>IBM Payment Systems offers commercial clients a range of payment collection services designed to interface directly into clients’ billing systems. In order to deliver these services, IBM works with a network of partner banks which provide access to collection services and methods. In January 2007 IBM identified a gap in this network in the Nordic and Baltic region.</p>

<p>IBM Payment Systems is a hosted offering which delivers electronic payment and collection services to commercial clients worldwide.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>IBM Payment Systems processes clients’ transactions and settles these transactions into the clients’ collection accounts. Once payment is received, the settlement data is fed into clients’ AR, ledger and treasury management systems and is reconciled against open postings for the collection items in question. “By converting to a purely electronic system, treasurers can realise a number of benefits,” comments Lars Hauge Andersen, Advisory Solution Architect at IBM. “For example, the fees for lockbox processing are five to ten times higher than fees for purely electronic payments.”</p>
<p>IBM also offers a managed business process service, whereby IBM monitors payment files and ensures that these items are reconciled, thereby taking over most of their clients’ day-to-day dealings with the banks.</p>
<p>One of IBM’s customers, a European car manufacturer, was looking for a payment solution to support its entry into a new market in the Nordic area. While the company had previously worked only with car dealers, it now wanted to sell maintenance contracts to individual car owners. However, the company’s existing system was only capable of supporting the car dealers’ transactions and was unable to manage open postings and transactions for the individual car owners.</p>
<p>The manufacturer approached IBM for a solution that would enable them to outsource the full collection process – including invoicing and accounts receivable – for the car owners. IBM put together a solution based on the IBM platform but as the manufacturer payments to be collected in the Nordics, IBM needed to find a bank that could support this.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>IBM assessed several banks in the Nordic region and concluded that Danske Bank had the most centralised IT platform and the best skills in the region. Danske Bank was therefore selected to be IBM Payment Services’ banking partner in the Nordic region and to supply the system that would support IBM’s solution for the car manufacturer.</p>
<p>The chosen solution, Danske Bank’s Collection Service, is a web-based solution which receives and processes electronic invoices and collections. It allows IBM to process collections throughout the region using one IT platform. In conjunction with IBM Payment Systems’ solution, Collection Service enables the car manufacturer to receive direct debit payments, as well as payments made by more traditional methods, from all the individual car owners.</p>
<p>The car manufacturer benefits from lower cost of payments as well as low DSO (Days Sales Outstanding) in the fully outsourced solution. Data regarding the collections is also supplied in a manageable format. “The client does not need to think about the individual car owners – they just receive a monthly summarised report saying how much we’ve collected for them,” says Andersen.</p>
<p>The car manufacturer decided to use this solution and IBM is currently in the process of implementing it. As the solution is provided on a country by country basis, it is straightforward to integrate one country at a time. So far the system is in place in eight European countries, and it is due to be implemented in a further eight countries later in 2008. “What was really unique and good about the Danske Bank implementation was that we had one person who knew all the markets very well – we could get all our questions answered through this point of contact,” says Andersen. “On top of that, the fact that there was a single IT platform made the implementation very smooth.”</p>
<p>IBM is now looking at ways in which Danske Bank’s solution can be incorporated into IBM’s payment services in order to support other clients in the region.</p>


<p><strong>Danske Bank Group</strong> is a leading provider of financial services in Northern Europe. The Group markets their solutions under the brand names of Danske Bank, Fokus Bank, Sampo Bank, National Irish Bank and Northern Bank.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>In 2007, GSKCH decided that there was scope for improvements to be made to the way in which collections were managed.</p>

<h5 class=""title"">General Manager Finance</h5>
<img alt=""GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Ltd"" class=""logo org"" height=""40"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/gsk-logo-2008-120x40.png"" width=""120""/>

<p>GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Ltd. (GSKCH), which was established in 1958, is an associate of GlaxoSmithKline plc. of the UK, a global science based healthcare company. GSKCH has continually benefited from the technical and marketing inputs that have been available as a consequence of this association. GSKCH is the largest player in the health food drinks industry in India. The company, with its manufacturing plants located in Nabha, Rajahmundry and Sonepat, has a total workforce of about 2,700 people.</p>
<p>GSKCH has a strong marketing and distribution network in India, comprising over 1,800 wholesalers and direct coverage of over 450,000 retail outlets. Its flagship product, Horlicks, has been a widely regarded and highly respected brand for over 100 years. The company also manufactures and markets Boost, Viva and Maltova and in addition markets and distributes a number of products in diverse categories, which include prominent household names such as Eno, Crocin and Iodex.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>GSKCH had a number of distributors who were paying for goods using demand drafts. Demand drafts are paper based and consequently the system was associated with inefficiencies. GSKCH would receive signed demand drafts from its customers and would then enter the data into its ERP system. An invoice would then be generated based on the customer’s order. This arrangement required a considerable amount of manual work and reconciliation.</p>
<p>A decision was therefore taken to move to a more automated process. “We decided to move to full electronic banking,” explains Indrajit Sengupta, GSKCH’s Finance Manager. “We wanted to improve the efficiency and speed of the system, incorporating all our vendors, customers and business partners into the process.” By receiving funds through India’s RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement) or NEFT (National Electronic Funds Transfer) systems, GSKCH could significantly speed up the collection process. However, if all the funds were to be received electronically from more than 400 distributors, a time-consuming reconciliation process would be needed in order to link up the receipts of funds with each distributor.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>GSKCH, in partnership with Deutsche Bank, led an initiative to centralise its entire payment and collection process three years ago. Before that, collections had been managed from four different Regional Offices, and payments were managed from 14 locations. This enabled funds to be swept, at the end of each day, into one main bank account held at the corporate office, significantly reducing both the number of bank accounts that GSKCH was holding and the idle funds held by the company.</p>
<p>Once the decision had been made to receive customers’ payments electronically, GSKCH discussed the question of reconciliation with its partner bank. “We had a nine hour meeting with them at their headquarters in Mumbai,” recalls Sengupta. “During that meeting we came to the concept of Payer ID, whereby our partner bank would assign a Payer ID to each of our customers.” The proposed solution would resolve the reconciliation issue by assigning an identification code to each of the distributors, which could then be used to match up each payment with the customer’s details.</p>
<p>Once the Payer ID solution had been developed, GSKCH began to migrate its distributors over to the new system. In order to do this, GSKCH provided its partner bank with each distributor’s details, enabling the Bank to issue a Payer ID for each customer, which GSKCH then communicated to the customer. Thereafter, when the customer made a payment, the funds were transferred electronically using the Payer ID code, which enabled the Bank to reconcile the payment with its originator. Consequently GSKCH now receives both the funds and the details of the transaction straight away.</p>
<p>Sengupta is enthusiastic about the new system and points out that GSKCH’s distributors have benefited from the arrangement. The faster reconciliation process enables GSKCH to dispatch goods more rapidly, a process which had previously taken up to six days due to the time taken to reconcile the demand drafts. “They are now getting a much faster turnaround time, relieving the pressure on their working capital,” Sengupta explains. “And as far as GSK is concerned we now have a very good real-time online system – it is much easier for us to monitor our collections.” He is also appreciative of the service that the partner has provided in developing the Payer ID solution to meet GSKCH’s needs. “The bank has been very supportive in rolling out this concept and making it a reality.”</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Vossloh-Schwabe’s decision to restructure its treasury from a decentralised model to a centralised function made a review of the methods it used to gather treasury information essential.</p>


<h4 class=""fn"">Beate Schroeder</h4>
<h5 class=""title"">Treasurer</h5>
<img alt=""Panasonic"" class=""logo org"" height=""29"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/panasonic-logo-2007-100x29.png"" width=""100""/>

<p>Panasonic Electric Works Vossloh-Schwabe GmbH is a multinational company focusing on the development, production and sale of components for lighting technology. It has production plants and sales offices in Europe, North Africa, Asia and the United States of America. Wholly owned by Matsushita Electric Works of Japan (MEW), best known for their global brand of Panasonic, Vossloh-Schwabe is a self-contained trademark for all MEW Group activities within the lighting technical components market.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>“We needed to improve our view of cash activity and liquidity across all our subsidiaries, particularly the flows in and out of our euro currency cash pool” explains Vossloh-Schwabe’s Treasurer, Beate Schroeder. “We wanted to be able to classify payments, such as inter-company, third-party supply and tax refunds, and link these to the cash flows so that we could optimise our analysis of forecasts versus actual results. We also wanted detailed inter-company interest statements, and to be able to apply the appropriate interest rates and transfer pricing terms to our different company entities. Achieving all this was impossible with the Excel database we were using.”</p>
<p>Vossloh-Schwabe also had its regulatory obligations to consider. Its parent company, MEW Group, is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Therefore, it was important to have adequate financial transparency and treasury controls to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley.</p>
<p>The company needed a solution that would make it easier and quicker to gather accurate information, deliver the detail necessary to support financial analysis and decision-making, and provide the tight control essential for managing its treasury operations.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>Vossloh-Schwabe prepared a long list of requirements and held several presentations to review the solution options available. They were immediately impressed with Commerzbank’s TREASURY. Schroeder says, “We already had a relationship with Commerzbank having used their Treasury Cockpit, but the functionality on that was very limited. So when I saw their new TREASURY system and all its features I thought it was fantastic. I realised straight away that it was going to help me in my work – and it has.”</p>
<p>TREASURY is a web-based system which means Schroeder and her treasury colleagues can access the information they need wherever they are in the world, as long as they have an internet connection. Its administration capabilities ensure that access is secure and controlled, so that users see only the information they are authorised to view – crucial for segregating duties between front and back office operations. As it is a single database, information is entered only once (with appropriate authorisation workflows), avoiding the duplication of tasks across the company.</p>
<p>Schroeder is particularly pleased with TREASURY’s financial reporting, which has delivered the classification capability the company required. “The design of the report templates is very user friendly,” Schroeder says. “I can customise these to a layout of my choice. I can separate cash inflows and outflows by customer, identify inter-company netting and clearing activities, and run intercompany interest statements for the cash pool and interest statements from banks. TREASURY’s tools ensure everything is properly reflected in our cash flow planning.”</p>
<p>TREASURY retains a complete history of all daily transactions and dealing activity, including money and foreign exchange deals, intercompany loans, third-party loans and deposits. Market interest rates and currency exchange rates are provided automatically on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Implementing Commerzbank’s TREASURY has enabled Vossloh-Schwabe to exercise greater control over its treasury operations. “The next step is automatic inter-company netting,” says Schroeder. “We currently use another provider for this but Commerzbank plans to introduce the capability on to their TREASURY platform. When they do, we’ll move our inter-company netting to them so that we have a single system delivering all of our main treasury requirements.”</p>

Its main activity is the manufacturing, marketing and sale of cement, concrete, aggregate and mortar cement, as well as logistics and valuing waste. Holcim España is part of the multinational Swiss holding group Holcim, which is present in more than 70 countries and is one of the leading companies in this industrial sector.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>“The objective was to reduce administrative work, such as signing, handling and sending documents, as much as possible without losing any control over the payment process. At the same time we wanted to offer our suppliers a better payment system with better conditions, specifically financial and risk conditions.</p>
<p>Our decision was to outsource these tasks; therefore we searched the market for an expert able to adapt its knowledge to our complexity. We were looking for a global service package able to adapt to our own and our suppliers’ needs.”</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>The solution chosen by Martínez and Encinas was created by Santander Factoring and Confirming S.A. (a 100% subsidiary of Grupo Santander). “Holcim had a strong motivation for selecting SFC,” says Martínez. “Being pioneers in the product gives them an advantage against their competitors. At the same time, we based the decision on our strong banking relationship with SFC and on their wide factoring experience in financing receivables, short-term credit insurance, payments and collections.”</p>
<p>In a written agreement, Martínez and Encinas entrusted SFC with the performance of all Holcim’s administrative tasks relating to suppliers’ payment processes. The solution uses Confirming<sup>®</sup>, an administrative and financial service that benefits both Holcim and Holcim’s suppliers. The solution improves Holcim’s payment chain management in three main areas, as Martínez and Encinas explain:</p>
<p>“Firstly, from an administrative point of view, we get control over the amounts and maturity dates of our payments. We decide how and when to pay using different payment methods (cheques or electronic transfers). From the moment we send the irrevocable payment order to SFC, we avoid all the workload linked to the payment process, such as printing and signing of bank orders or cheques, packing and postal mail, document reconciliation and lost claims.</p>
<p>Secondly, we have simplified our accounting by negotiating the most suitable way for Holcim to charge our bank account with SFC. Due to our reconciliation needs, we wanted charges to be done invoice by invoice to allow an automatic matching of all our records (although there were other possibilities such as grouping by total amount or reference numbers, supplier, maturity dates, etc). As a consequence of that, our accounting has improved notably.</p>
<p>Thirdly, Confirming<sup>®</sup> has turned into a very powerful negotiation tool. Through SFC, we can provide our suppliers with a very strong financial product that eliminates a significant number of administrative tasks and reduces the cost of our collection procedures. Suppliers can also request an advanced payment for one or several invoices at any time before maturity date, without the need of a credit line. SFC pays the supplier the advanced payment and Holcim then repays SFC at the maturity date.”</p>
<p>Financing through Confirming<sup>®</sup> means the assignment of receivables without recourse, as SFC takes on the associated credit risk. This tool also improves the working capital position of Holcim’s suppliers, as suppliers can convert these receivables into cash. The advanced payment does not increase the supplier’s credit exposure so it does not impact on the supplier’s access to finance.</p>
<p>Martínez and Encinas feel that the integration of Confirming<sup>®</sup> has added significant value to their payment chain management. “We feel fully in control by using the website, through which we can query and operate online. The suppliers can calculate their advance payment and all our information may be downloaded in Microsoft Excel format at a mouse click.” In addition, the support they receive from SFC ensures a smooth service: “Since day one, we and our suppliers have received support from a specialised Confirming<sup>®</sup> team via their call centre.”</p>

<p>Outsourcing transport related administrative processes can be attractive to many companies as standard ERP systems are often not able to handle the complexities of the freight business.

<p>ControlPay is a specialised business process outsourcing provider with headquarters in Breda, the Netherlands, and a service centre operating from Kiev, Ukraine. The company was founded in 2001 as an independent freight audit solutions provider that offers services from transport order management to the administrative and financial settlement between shippers and carriers in the freight logistics market.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>ControlPay offers a web-based electronic solution that was developed in co-operation with Deloitte to ensure the best possible accuracy and auditing procedures. Based on existing carrier agreements between shippers and carriers and subsequent transport orders, ControlPay’s application calculates the exact freight costs. The system then instructs the carrier which amount should be invoiced and supplies all other relevant payment information. When the carrier responds with the actual invoice, the invoice information is checked against the system and if correct, ControlPay instructs the shipper to pay the amount.</p>
<p>The missing link in this procure-to-pay chain was ControlPay’s ability to offer its customers the execution of the payment itself. In order to provide the complete outsourcing service from transport order management to payment, ControlPay required a strong cash management bank. Henk Jan Kinds, Financial Officer Accounts Payable, summarises ControlPay’s needs: “We were looking for a bank which could offer us a global solution, because initially we are focused on Europe, but in time we will be making payments globally. In addition, we needed access from all over the world to be able to pay. We also needed a system which would allow us to make the invoices which we were paying visible to both our customers and their carriers.”</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>ControlPay invited a number of banks for tender and eventually selected Deutsche Bank’s db-direct internet solution. “The functionality of db-direct internet was important to us as well as the proven record of that application. db-direct internet had a better functionality than the other solutions we looked at. In addition to that, the pro-active attitude of Deutsche Bank towards our needs was also an important factor,” states Kinds.</p>
<p>In Europe, ControlPay wished to open a single euro account for each customer. Deutsche Bank’s commitment to SEPA was therefore a key factor. Meanwhile, in order to cope with the future growth of ControlPay’s operations around the world and particularly in Asia, Deutsche Bank‘s extensive global coverage was another important consideration.</p>
<p>ControlPay now opens a Deutsche Bank account for each new customer. As Kees de Jongh, COO of ControlPay explains, “This is for the simple reason that we want the whole fund flow to be completely visible to our customers, who have a view function to their account.” This is achieved by linking Deutsche Bank’s db-direct internet application to ControlPay’s web-based system. Payment related MT940 messages automatically update ControlPay’s system, which then makes the information visible to both the shipper and carrier concerned. Once the shipper has funded its Deutsche Bank account, ControlPay’s application is updated and the payment to the carrier is initiated in db-direct internet.</p>
<p>Finally, db-direct’s internet functionality strongly supports ControlPay’s audit-centred business approach and imminent SAS 70 type II certification, which will validate the compliance of ControlPay’s procedures and processes with Sarbanes-Oxley.</p>

"Problem Solved: Gernot Netinger, ÖBB Holding","




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>ÖBB underwent a major restructuring in 2005 which resulted in a group structure with 100 subsidiaries throughout Austria, with issues on cost allocation and centralising cash flows at the treasury level. DB-netting, a receivables driven web-based netting system, allowed each subsidiary to make a single payment or receive payment from the netting centre each month, thereby cutting significantly the number of transactions between them.</p>


<h4 class=""fn"">Gernot Netinger</h4>
<h5 class=""title"">Head of Financial Services, Corporate Treasury</h5>
<img alt=""ÖBB Holding"" class=""logo org"" height=""39"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/obb-holding-logo-2007-60x39.png"" width=""60""/>

<p>ÖBB Holding AG is the holding company for ÖBB Group, the Austrian railways company. Wholly owned by the Republic of Austria, ÖBB Holding is responsible for strategically managing the ÖBB Group’s subsidiaries and co-ordinating Research and Development activities throughout the Group. The ÖBB Group consists of around 100 companies and employs 45,000 staff.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>Following a major restructuring at the beginning of 2005, ÖBB moved to a group structure with ÖBB Holding acting as the parent company to around 100 subsidiaries throughout Austria. As these subsidiaries had originally been divisions of the ÖBB company, services between them had previously been charged internally. However, as a result of the restructuring, the cost allocation had to be treated as intragroup payments.</p>
<p>In order to centralise the cash flows at the treasury level, ÖBB Holding decided to look for a netting solution that would reduce the volume of payments while increasing efficiency and cost effectiveness. An important requirement was the interoperability with ÖBB’s in-house ERP system, SAP – in order to avoid system breakages, as well as to make the workflows of the integrated entities as efficient as possible.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>Gernot Netinger, Head of Financial Services at ÖBB Holding’s Corporate Treasury, discussed his requirements with Deutsche Bank representatives at a treasury conference in 2005. Having analysed various providers in detail, Netinger decided that Deutsche Bank’s solution was the best fit for ÖBB Holding’s requirements. “We wanted to have a solution from a company which had extensive experience in this area. We were aiming to implement the solution within four or five months, so a high level of support by the provider was also a priority. Deutsche Bank’s proposed solution proved to be an ideal system for our company and with favourable implementation costs, there was no problem getting approval from the board.”</p>
<p>The solution of choice was db-netting, a receivables driven web-based netting system. Using this system, each company makes a single payment to, or receives a single payment from, the netting centre each month. This significantly reduces the number of transactions taking place between the subsidiaries. The participating ÖBB companies enter their transactions into SAP by the notification date each month and the transactions are then uploaded into db-netting. Once the initial calculation has been made, participants are able to dispute payments until the dispute date arrives and the payments are then settled. The final payments are automatically reconciled with SAP.</p>
<p>The system was initially rolled out to nine of ÖBB Holding’s subsidiaries in 2005, with six more companies integrated into the solution the following year. The implementation was smooth, with minor difficulties in the interface with SAP resolved quickly. On the treasury side, the implementation was run by one member of staff, with one or two people responsible for the netting process in each participating company. As the solution is web-based, ÖBB Holding does not have to carry out any ongoing software maintenance, while all the data is stored on Deutsche Bank’s server, removing the need to carry out back-ups.</p>
<p>Netinger remains pleased with the new system. “We are very satisfied. On the one hand, there are no technical problems; on the other it has been easy to introduce this solution as it is a web-based application.” Netinger is planning to continue to roll the system out to ÖBB Holding’s subsidiaries in waves. Another 10 companies will be added in 2007, and up to 15 will be added in 2008, with the eventual goal of incorporating all 100 of ÖBB Holding’s subsidiaries into the system.</p>

<h5 id=""netting-systems"">Netting systems</h5>
<p>Netting systems allow inter-company payments to be made on a net rather than a gross basis. Instead of making bilateral payments between each other, all the participating entities agree the amounts due to and from each other in the settlement period. Rather than make a payment for each amount, a single net payment is then made or received from the central netting centre at the end of every settlement period (netting cycle). Each participant holds an ‘account’ with the netting centre, which acts as a counterparty to all the companies in the netting group.</p>

Swiss Re’s traditional reinsurance products and related services, under the business lines of property and casualty as well as life and health, are supplemented by insurance-based corporate finance solutions and risk management services.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>In 2004, as a result of a decentralised approach and several acquisitions in the recent past, the company was using seven different software systems to manage treasury and cash management throughout the group.</p>
<p>The fragmented systems infrastructure meant that aggregated information on the group’s cash flow had to be collected manually. As Jürg Hess, Head of Corporate Finance and Treasury at Swiss Re explains, this made it very difficult to determine the group’s cash position accurately and in a timely fashion. “Nobody was able to establish our cash exposure to certain institutions. Also, nobody was able to say what our actual aggregated cash in and outflow was on a daily, monthly or even on a quarterly basis.”</p>
<p>The technical infrastructure was further complicated by different legacy insurance systems at the three hubs in Switzerland, the UK and the US. As Hess explains, “We had to find a single cash management solution that would fulfil the different requirements in these hubs and that could also be integrated with the different legacy systems in each location.”</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>Together with the IT department, Swiss Re’s treasury determined which capabilities the new system should have. “When you want to win people over, you need to give them a system that can do the things that they want,” says Hess. “The emphasis was to look for a system that could fulfil almost all the requirements that anyone could have.”</p>
<p>Considering three main selection criteria – system functionalities, best practice in IT architecture and the solidity of the software provider itself – Swiss Re could identify only one system that would be able to meet its needs efficiently: SunGard’s AvantGard Quantum. The first phase of the implementation of AvantGard Quantum was finalised in the summer of 2006 and it has already brought numerous benefits according to Hess. The substitution of several disparate systems for a single system meant that maintenance and licensing costs were reduced. At the same time, any future changes to the new system will now only affect the redesign of one interface, instead of many.</p>
<p>In terms of cash management, AvantGard Quantum provides Swiss Re’s treasury with a consolidated overview of the group’s cash and cash equivalent balances in the CHF 5 billion range from approximately 1,400 operational and investment bank accounts. “We know now where the cash is,” says Hess. “We have a much better understanding now where it is coming from and where it is going to.” The new infrastructure has also enabled Swiss Re to streamline its treasury structure. “We believe that the new system has served as a catalyst to form a single team out of three teams in the individual hubs, which previously did not really interact with each other.”</p>
<p>Finally, the new system has brought with it a number of efficiency gains and savings for Swiss Re. “We learnt during the past months where our weaknesses were with regards to bank management or where we did not get the best returns. We are also able to net many intracompany transactions, which represents significant savings.”</p>
<p>Currently, Swiss Re is adding functionalities to SunGard’s AvantGard Quantum on a frequent basis. “First, we wanted transparency of the group cash flow through a real-time view and straight through processing approach to treasury and cash management,” says Hess. “In a second stage, we want now to become the in-house bank for the Swiss Re Group. We will ensure that the system supports the best practice processes and guarantees that policies and procedures are implemented and complied with. We also want to use the system as a maintenance facility for all trade and intragroup transactions. In addition, we aim to get more data into the system so we can improve the consistency of our cash forecasting.”</p>

<p>Fresenius’s Asia Pacific operation was in dire need of revamping its existing corporate structure,  which included centralising and harmonising its processes.  Through db-direct internet, the company cut the number of manual processes, paving the way for a more efficient and effective control over account balances and cash movements.</p>

<p>Fresenius Medical Care (FMC) is the world’s largest provider of products and services for individuals with chronic kidney failure. The company, which is listed on both the Frankfurt and New York stock exchanges, operates a network of over 2,000 dialysis clinics in North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific and provides dialysis treatment to more than 161,000 patients worldwide. It is also the world’s largest provider of dialysis products, such as hemodialysis machines, dialysers and related products.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>FMC has a fast growing presence in Asia Pacific with production facilities in Japan and Australia and a large network of after-sales, clinical training and patient care services in 13 countries/regions. The business of the Asia Pacific region is co-ordinated by the regional headquarters in Hong Kong. FMC’s corporate finance and treasury function is largely centralised in the company’s global headquarters in Germany, as Timothy Leung, Senior Manager of the company’s finance and controlling department in Asia Pacific explains: “The Group treasury department in Germany co-ordinates the relationship with banks and advises on the matters of cash and risk management on a strategic level. We have the functions of regional co-ordination, with regard to data analysis and management reporting, and we provide immediate advice to subsidiaries in areas such as financing, hedging and tax planning.”</p>
<p>Under the existing corporate structure, daily banking activities remained decentralised in the region, which relied heavily on manual processes. Local subsidiaries in the region were supported by numerous local banks and their different systems. In order to centralise and to harmonise processes, FMC decided to establish one key banking relationship in the region, which would also offer the company a single online banking platform.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>Timothy Leung and FMC turned to Deutsche Bank. “Our company has a strong German background and FMC had a long-standing relationship with Deutsche Bank even before we came to Asia Pacific,” explains Leung. “So strategically Deutsche Bank was already our partner. It seemed reasonable that, having entered Asia Pacific, we should also bring in this partner to help us with our business development. Deutsche Bank has a very long history here in this region and full network coverage. And Deutsche Bank has also developed an excellent electronic banking platform, db-direct internet, which really helped us to streamline our workflow.”</p>
<p>Through the adoption of db-direct internet, FMC reduced the number of manual processes and ensured a more efficient and effective control over account balances and cash movements. db-direct internet also presented FMC with more flexibility in the company’s internal approval processes. Senior management staff who are travelling or based outside the region are now able to authorise transactions from anywhere in the world without having to delegate authority to local staff.</p>
<p>The implementation of the platform, country by country throughout Asia Pacific, went smoothly, according to Leung: “db-direct internet is a very user friendly system and it was not an issue to implement it from a technical point of view. The implementation processes were smooth, because we have a very supportive Deutsche Bank team here in Hong Kong, which provided us with training and also took care of the documentation.”</p>
<p>The selection of Deutsche Bank offers FMC many other benefits in addition to the online banking system, according to Leung. “The business relationship in Germany is a critical factor. When local subsidiaries in Asia Pacific send funds back to Germany it makes more sense to use the banking services of the same bank rather than different banks. Deutsche Bank also supports us by providing valuable advice on financing and legal structures in the case of a new acquisition or when we want to establish a new entity. The bank will also share with us their knowledge on local regulatory requirements and approval procedures, when we are going to enter into emerging markets, in which we have no physical presence and where we are not quite familiar with the business environment of that particular country.”</p>
<p>He concludes: “Deutsche Bank’s local experience and their network in Asia Pacific together with the electronic banking platform really give us a complete business solution.”</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>MACH handles anything between 5,000-10,000 monthly payments for the mobile operator industry and as such needed a system that gave the company complete control over the payment orders.  Deutsche Bank’s db-connect allowed the company to automate the entire process as well as boost security.</p>


<h4 class=""fn"">Rob Ramsay</h4>
<h5 class=""title"">Director of Financial Clearing</h5>
<img alt=""MACH"" class=""logo org"" height=""23"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/mach-logo-2006-70x23.png"" width=""70""/>

<p>MACH is a financial service provider to the majority of the world’s mobile telephone operators. About half of all mobile telephone companies worldwide outsource their accounts receivable and accounts payable processes to inter-operator solution providers like MACH in order to focus on their core telecommunications activities.</p>
<p>Through one of its main services, MACH enables mobile operators to exchange billing and payment information relating to roaming – the extension of connectivity services from one mobile operating company to the subscribers of another operator. MACH, based in Luxembourg, has offices in 10 countries in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, South America and the US and provides its customers with a secure channel to deliver roaming data between the mobile operators. MACH aggregates and nets the balances of individual roaming partners, and collects or initiates the payments of the related charges on their behalf.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>MACH handles substantial amounts of business-critical data for the mobile operator industry and effects between 5,000 and 10,000 payments per month. Clients, particularly operators that are subject to the US Sarbanes-Oxley legislation, consider it essential that their service providers have certified secure internal control processes.</p>
<p>In 2006, MACH successfully completed the SAS 70 type II certification for its Data Clearing services, allowing it to demonstrate the soundness of its international control activities and processes to its customer base. Subsequently, MACH needed to extend the audit to its Financial Clearing services. Rob Ramsay, Director of Financial Clearing at MACH, explains that in order to obtain the certification the company required a solution that would automate the workflow throughout the payment cycle. “One of the issues that we have with SAS 70 is to ensure that we have complete control over the payment orders. So we wanted to establish a straight through process from the creation of the payment file in our proprietary system right through to the deposit of the payment instruction with the bank. The challenge for us was to get the payment files to the bank without any kind of manual interference.”</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>Prior to MACH’s merger with Danish clearing house DanNet, both companies had been looking for a clearing bank and both had independently identified Deutsche Bank as their desired provider on the basis of a number of selection criteria. “We considered foreign exchange activity, the account structure and the administrative tasks,” explains Ramsay. “We also looked at the online features and the ease of use for the clients. In all cases Deutsche Bank was identified as the number one provider.”</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank offered db-connect, the bank’s host-to-host solution, for the transmission of payment files from MACH’s proprietary ERP system to Deutsche Bank. “db-connect has allowed us to automate the entire process,” says Ramsay. “We create the payment file through our proprietary system which deposits it with db-connect which then takes care of the upload and the reporting.”</p>
<p>Using db-connect MACH not only automated the payment process and improved efficiency of the workflow but also increased its security. “When the payment files have been automatically pushed to the bank, db-connect uploads the file in such a way that once it is in Deutsche Bank’s online systems the information cannot be manipulated.” The uploaded payment files are then reviewed and authorised via Deutsche Bank’s browser based db-direct internet online banking tool. This gives MACH the flexibility to initiate payments in one of its four clearing centres, and approve them centrally, thereby assuring a controlled process.</p>
<p>Based on the new system Ramsay is confident that MACH will obtain the SAS 70 type II certification for its financial clearing processes as soon as it has collected six months of live data necessary for the audit. In addition, db-connect will allow MACH to improve its existing cash collection services. As Ramsay states, “MACH has made substantial investments into an automated cash book facility and the automatic reconciliation of incoming cash movements with payments. For that it is important that we are able to receive SWIFT information in a timely manner and that we are able to control that information through our systems to match those payments. That is something else that db-connect will allow us to do.”</p>

<p>Coherent has operations in several European countries, including manufacturing locations in Finland, Germany and the UK and sales and service offices in Belgium, France, Italy and the Netherlands. The company also has significant operations in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in Japan, which accounts for over a fifth of its global sales.</p>

<p>Coherent is a US-based multinational specialising in photonics. The company has production and research facilities in Europe and North America, and sales and service locations in Asia. Coherent’s products include everything from discrete laser systems and components to complete laser measurement and control products. The company employs some 2,300 people throughout the world and posted sales of just over $500m in 2005.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>In spite of its large global reach, Coherent operates a very small treasury function, based in Santa Clara, California. The majority of Coherent’s European routine treasury activities are outsourced to an independent treasury service provider (FTI) based in Dublin, Ireland. The outsource service provider runs Coherent’s cash balancing functions, oversees its cash pooling arrangements and takes care of its foreign exchange hedging.</p>
<p>Although the majority of Coherent’s day-to-day treasury activities are carried out by its outsource service provider, it was felt that a more centralised approach would be beneficial, particularly in Europe. The company had struggled to maintain control over the balances of its subsidiaries’ bank accounts. Coherent’s Senior Vice President and Treasurer, Dennis C. Bucek, explains: “You almost had to go ‘hat in hand’ and beg the controllers to send you cash. The desire was to have a similar type of structure in Europe to that which we had in the United States, to make sure that we had better control over the cash.”</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>Coherent felt that there were significant benefits to be achieved by implementing some form of automated cash pooling arrangement. The decision was taken to implement a series of cross-border, zero balancing cash pools – denominated in euro, sterling and US dollar – for the company’s European operations. The day-to-day activities of the cash pools would be overseen by Coherent’s outsource service provider and Coherent selected Commerzbank as the bank provider on the back of an extensive review process.</p>
<p>An overlay account structure is in place for the UK-based operations. Coherent’s outsource service provider uses the bank’s web-based electronic banking tool to maintain visibility over balances of all the accounts in the pools, updating Coherent treasury on a weekly basis. All positive account balances are swept into the header accounts, with cash being redistributed to the various subsidiaries’ accounts as required. “The subsidiaries, regardless of whether they are a sales office or a manufacturing location, have to request, on a weekly basis, what they need to meet their obligations,” explains Bucek. “That amount of cash is then transferred back to them.”</p>
<p>The company’s primary motivation for selecting the bank was a history of good banking relationships. “We’d had a long standing relationship with Commerzbank,” says Bucek. “They had been our banker since 1972, when we first set up a sales office in Germany. I wanted to build that relationship and that’s really where the decision lay.” However, the quality of the service on offer was also important. “If we didn’t think that Commerzbank had a good and viable solution then we would have gone elsewhere.”</p>
<p>Coherent implemented the cash pooling structure across all its operations simultaneously, a process which took some nine months to implement fully. The controller of the company’s Dieburg, Germany operations managed the implementation process, including opening all the accounts. The setting up of the cash pool was fairly straightforward, with no major hurdles to be overcome. According to Bucek, “The biggest issue was just all the documentation that was required.”</p>
<p>The implementation of the European cash pools has enabled Coherent treasury to gain a much greater degree of control over the cash balances of the subsidiaries. In addition, all invoices are generated from a single, central location, whilst all collections are also overseen and processed at a central location. “I think that this really satisfied senior management’s desire to have a structure in Europe that was similar to what we have in the United States,” says Bucek.</p>

<p>Optimal Payments’s stored value electronic wallet to hold funds in different currencies was already offered in North America but it needed a similar processing solution in Europe.

<img alt=""Optimal Payments"" class=""logo org"" height=""27"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/optimal-payments-logo-2006-90x27.png"" width=""90""/>

<p>Optimal Payments is a subsidiary of Optimal Group, a NASDAQ listed payment services group based in Montreal, Canada with offices in the USA, the UK and Ireland. Optimal Payments processes payments made over the internet, by telephone and in person at point of sale. It also provides an electronic wallet used to store funds and make payments on websites. The group has revenues of around $200m and employs 260 staff.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>A subsidiary of the Group has developed a stored value electronic wallet, which is used to hold funds in different currencies which can then be spent at online casinos and other websites. Customers add funds to the wallet by direct debit. While the Group had already found a processing solution to support this offering in North America, it needed to find a solution for the European market that would provide access to the local low-value clearing systems.</p>
<p>In addition, there was a need to automate internal back office processes. The Group has over 100 bank accounts and 18 different banking relationships. Outbound payments were being entered manually into each bank’s proprietary platform, while a range of different in-house and external solutions were in use, making the reconciliation process fragmented and treasury a manual process. A more coherent solution was needed to enhance efficiency, while Optimal Group’s NASDAQ listing also meant that demonstrating the solution’s compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley was a key requirement.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>In 2003, Emmanuel Pantelakis, Treasurer of Optimal Payments, spoke to several different banks before choosing the solutions offered by Barclays. “In all of our analysis, Barclays came up ahead of everyone else. Being one of the major banks in the world and being present in the UK was a factor, but the software and the different products that they had were also part of the reason why we chose Barclays.”</p>
<p>In addition to helping the Group set up bank accounts in the relevant European countries, the solution provided by Barclays has two main elements. The first is the use of Barclays Euro Treasurer (BET – Barclays electronic banking gateway for treasury payments and reporting) as a single payments and collections platform. So far, this solution has been implemented in the UK, enabling the wallets to be funded in pounds. BET is also currently being rolled out in the five largest EURO markets. However, there are further plans to enable customers to fund their electronic wallets with credit card and debit card payments, while expansion across Europe and beyond is also planned. “We’re starting with five or six European countries, and within a 12 month or so timeframe we’re planning to expand into the other 10-15 and then hopefully start expanding into the Asia Pacific region,” explains Pantelakis. “So for us, as we keep on expanding and broadening our range, Barclays is the perfect solution because they have all the connections in all the different countries that we need.”</p>
<p>For the second part of the solution, Barclays has invited the Group to join the Barclays SWIFT MA-CUG in order to enable straight through processing. “Everything will be automated,” Pantelakis explains. “Our system will generate a file and I’ll say ‘You’ve got to pay ABC Company $20,000’, and it’ll be sent just to Barclays from server to server, no manual interference, no manual errors. Barclays will be processing all our transactions for us.” In addition, Barclays has a bilateral agreement with other banks allowing it to forward payment messages on the Group’s behalf. All the payment messages will therefore be sent in one file and distributed by Barclays, providing a SOX-compliant solution requiring little or no manual intervention.</p>
<p>The choice of the Barclays solution was based on the company’s anticipated expansion as much as on its present needs, and Pantelakis is confident that the chosen solution will continue to meet the company’s evolving requirements. “They’re now by far the biggest bank that we use and the most important relationship that we have. Hopefully when we decide to go to the Asia Pac region, they will be able to help us as well.”</p>

<p>Dover Corporation manufactures a wide range of industrial products and components, which are sold into a variety of end-markets, including foodservice, environmental, as well as energy and product identification. Based in the US and traded on the NYSE (New York Stock Exchange), Dover consists of 38 independent operating companies, supplying customers in 100 countries and employing over 31,000 staff worldwide. In 2005, Dover’s turnover was $6 billion.</p>



<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>The company’s treasury is based in New York, with regional treasury staff based in Europe and Asia. In addition, each operating company has its own financial staff performing day-to-day treasury operations.</p>
<p>Until 2003, Dover’s eight Singapore subsidiaries individually managed their cash flow positions, denominated in US dollar, Singapore dollar and euro, with no sweeping structure in place. Paul Goldberg, Treasurer and Director of Investor Relations at Dover, explains: “Some of the companies had been established for a while and had plenty of cash inflows to match their outflows, but we had several companies that were in the early growth stage, and they were constantly short in cash. We struggled with developing a methodology to efficiently utilise cash already existing within the region so we would not have to continue to pump it in from outside the region.” Dover needed a solution that would enable the more efficient use of cash, while also providing the New York treasury with greater visibility over the subsidiaries’ cash flow positions.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>In an attempt to overcome this problem, Dover conducted an informal RFP process, interviewing several different banks operating in the region. The decision to appoint Deutsche Bank was based on a number of factors. Dover had a long-standing relationship with Deutsche Bank, particularly in Europe, and felt that the bank had a strong reputation for providing cash pooling services to a high standard. The bank’s experience in the region was also an important factor: “We looked at our list of banks and at that time Deutsche Bank had the best position in Singapore,” says Goldberg.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank set up a cash pool for Dover’s eight subsidiaries in Singapore, which enables excess cash denominated in each company’s operating currency to be swept to a holding company at the end of each day. Shortfall cash positions are likewise automatically funded by the holding company’s account. The operating companies are able to access their account details using Deutsche Bank’s online payment and account information system, db-direct internet. Meanwhile, Goldberg is able to obtain an overview of all the accounts each day. “From a corporate perspective, we can now see what is happening in the holding company and in the overall region on a consolidated basis. As a result, we can monitor much more closely which companies are using cash, creating cash, and ultimately what our cash balances are in the region. We do all that via db-direct internet.”</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank’s solution has resolved the key issues of efficiency and visibility. “The benefits are clear,” says Goldberg. “We have been able to manage cash much more efficiently in the area. We have also avoided the need to make additional capital contributions into the region as we now have this excess cash position. This can be used to fund expansion both in and outside Singapore – in China, for example.”</p>
<p>Looking forward, Deutsche Bank’s solution may be adapted to incorporate subsidiaries from other countries within the region. “As far as future developments are concerned, as we add companies in the region – which we do all the time – we just plug them into the cash pooling system and they are very happy. Currently, we are contemplating expanding the cash pooling system and setting up cash pools in other countries in Asia, such as Malaysia and Thailand.”</p>

<p>Roche is a leading healthcare company based in Basel, Switzerland. The Group is organised into two main operating divisions. The company’s pharmaceuticals business is particularly known for its range of cancer drugs and treatments in the fields of anaemia, transplantation and virology. In addition, Roche is the world leader in the diagnostics market. In 2005, it posted sales of over 35 billion Swiss francs and employed 68,000 people in more than 150 countries.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>Inter-company payments were made via the large number of bank relationships that Roche maintained in the region. In the five largest European countries, Roche used as many as 45 different bank interfaces for executing payments and collections.</p>
<p>As Martin Schlageter, Head of Treasury Operations at Roche explains, the company wanted to centralise the group’s treasury activities: “For Western Europe, the first goal was to optimise and centralise cash and fund management. We also wanted to establish an in-house bank that could offer services to our affiliates in terms of inter-company payments and FX-Hedging.”</p>
<p>The standardisation and harmonisation of bank interfaces was a necessary step to develop this in-house bank capability further. Roche required a standardised bank interface based on the IDOC format used by the company’s ERP systems. A pan-European cash pool structure was also needed to integrate the 35 entities in a main euro pool and 17 entities in sub-pools.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>Roche selected Deutsche Bank, not least for its vast network:”Our Bank relationship team did a very thorough review of all the capabilities of banks in Europe. Deutsche Bank, with its presence and history, is just like a local bank in many European countries. This local presence has a lot of advantages for our affiliates.”</p>
<p>Roche and Deutsche Bank started the implementation in several countries, moving on country by country. Twenty-five of the company’s entities were already banking with Deutsche Bank or its partner banks, leaving 27 entities which had to change their relationship bank. Before joining the cash pool, the entities needed to open bank accounts and establish access to db-direct internet, Deutsche Bank’s e-banking platform.</p>
<p>Once the entities were included in the cash pool, work could start on the payment and collection interfaces between Roche’s ERP systems and the Deutsche Bank system. “This was of course the most complex part because it involved a lot of testing,” explains Schlageter. “The aim was to have the interface up and running at least a couple of months after the cash pool went live.”</p>
<p>The speed and professionalism of Deutsche Bank’s customer service was key for the success of the project. “In total it took us 194 days to implement Cash Pooling in all 15 countries, and Deutsche Bank did a great job on that”. During the bank interface implementation, Deutsche Bank strongly supported our harmonisation efforts: “Even when Deutsche Bank initially did not provide a format we were asking for, they went to considerable lengths to develop something. This flexibility was highly appreciated.”</p>
<p>“Another important part of the project was that all our bank statements could be sent via MT940 to a global provider. We now download the bank statements into headquarters and from there we distribute them to the local systems, so that we no longer have local interfaces on the bank statement side.”</p>
<p>Today, Roche’s liquidity in Europe is optimised with fewer funds needed to finance short-term operating activities. Inter-company payments and FX-transactions of pool participants are executed via the cash pool. At the same time, the banking interfaces have been integrated, with no local interfaces on the incoming side and a standardised and harmonised interface for outgoing payments. This lays the foundation for Roche’s future plans to develop a payment factory.</p>

<p>Internally, Salesforce.com manages and authorises payments company-wide in its existing ERP system. However, according to Steve Cakebread, CFO at Salesforce.com, its own internal processing of payments lacked automation: “We had to enter the payment information into our ERP system and once the payment was approved and processed, a member of our staff would have to log-in to db-direct internet and manually input information to generate a payment.” This meant that the same payment information had to be keyed in by hand twice into two separate systems, not only resulting in overheads, but also leaving lots of room for error.</p>
<p>Salesforce.com needed a solution to reduce the time and operating costs required to process payments. At the same time, the company wanted to automate its global payments processing without necessarily having to resort to the large expense of implementing an EDI messaging capability.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…solved</h2>
<p>Cakebread states: “We approached Deutsche Bank as our primary banking service provider and we also did some research on what types of capabilities were available. The options that were put on the table for us had different levels of complexity, cost and user friendliness. Ultimately, we selected a Deutsche Bank-built interface for our ERP system, which is very reliable and simple to implement. It also did not require any extra software or hardware on our side.”</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank designed a piece of software to export language payment files from Salesforce.com’s ERP system into a common separated value (CSV) format. The bank sent two dedicated consultants to oversee the installation of the interface into the ERP system and support the testing of the application.</p>
<p>“The implementation took about a month. Most of that time was spent troubleshooting to ensure that all the ERP system set-ups were in agreement with the Deutsche Bank standards.”</p>
<p>The interfacing of db-direct internet’s global payments processing with the centralised payment initiation in Salesforce.com’s ERP system automated the company-wide payments processing, while maintaining the company’s existing systems.</p>
<p>“We currently do not use EDI messaging, so the fact that Deutsche Bank could provide us with a solution that would be equally reliable and permit us to automate that redundant step of entering the payment information for a second time was very attractive to us. We managed to achieve this efficiency in a fairly inexpensive way and the solution has been working very well. Information is now entered in our ERP system, approved and processed and then automatically uploaded into db-direct internet. All we have to do is just release the payment.”</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank provided Salesforce.com with a scalable solution that allows the straight-through processing of payments globally and thereby saves Salesforce.com valuable time at lower costs. In addition, it leverages the security of db-direct internet and minimises the potential for error by eliminating the manual input of payment information.</p>

"Problem Solved: Jane Pilcher, Anglian Water Services","

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Anglian Water had to prepare two sets of accounts – one under IFRS and the other according to UK-GAAP, making it a labour intensive process.  Reval’s Hedge Rx risk management system allowed the company to link its debt to the retail price index, offering a near perfect hedge for the company.</p>

<p>Part of the AWG Plc Group, Anglian Water Services is one of the leading providers of water and wastewater services in the UK. The company is located in the east of England and serves the needs of around six million industrial, commercial and domestic customers.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>As a subsidiary of AWG Plc Group, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, Anglian Water has to apply International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for the first time for its accounting period starting on 1<sup>st</sup> April 2005. While the Group will report consolidated group accounts under IFRS, Anglian Water Services Ltd will continue to report its accounts according to UK-GAAP.</p>
<p>In addition to having to prepare two sets of accounts, Anglian Water faces the problem of having to comply with IAS 39. Anglian Water has a large debt portfolio and hedges its interest rate and economic risk exposures extensively with derivative instruments, in particular swaps. In order to qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39, and to avoid volatility in the company’s profit and loss accounts resulting from the accounting changes, all hedging instruments need to be tested for their hedge effectiveness.</p>
<p>According to Group Treasurer Jane Pilcher, the accounting changes proved a challenge for Anglian Water’s treasury. “We do monthly accounting under IFRS and UK-GAAP and the way we were doing this, using spreadsheets, was pretty labour intensive. The effectiveness testing, with spreadsheets and Bloomberg data, was also quite piecemeal. We required a simpler and more robust system, which reduces the risk of error.” This system also needed to be able to consolidate the previously disparate data in one place.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>Jane Pilcher talked to the Group’s auditors to obtain their recommendations and spoke to peer companies about the systems they were using. Ultimately, Anglian Water opted for Reval’s Hedge Rx risk management system. “When we were doing our testing last year, Reval’s was the only system that we were satisfied with.”</p>
<p>A key functionality requirement for Anglian Water was related to the company’s debt structure. 43% of Anglian Water’s debt is linked to the UK’s retail price index (RPI), as the value of the capital and the interest element of these loans is directly linked to RPI movements. The company’s revenue is linked to RPI through a pricing formula determined by UK’s water regulator OFWAT. This pays a rate of return based on the company’s regulated asset value (RAV), the underlying economic asset against which the company borrows, which is also linked to RPI – this makes RPI index-linked debt a near perfect hedge for Anglian Water.</p>
<p>“It is important to us to have our debt and our asset base linked together. But RPI debt is not used by many corporates and there are not many treasury management systems that are able to deal with index-linked products. One of the things that we have been working on with Reval is to develop the RPI functionality, so that we would be able to put our index-linked bonds into Reval and then do the valuations from there.”</p>
<p>Instead of spreadsheets, Anglian Water now uses the Reval system to perform the statistical analysis for the effectiveness testing automatically. “Having put your transactions into the system, it values the exposure you have got to a standard set of yield curves. You don’t have to re-input things. It basically does it all for you.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Huntsman has grown rapidly largely through acquisitions and with the growth, it has inherited dealings with different banks, account structures and ERP systems.  However, with the help of Deutsche Bank as its main cash management bank in Europe, it implemented the IDOC format as its uniform payment system.</p>

<img alt=""Huntsman"" class=""logo org"" height=""35"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/huntsman-logo-2006-120x35.png"" width=""120""/>

<p>Huntsman is a global petrochemical manufacturer, producing chemicals for a wide range of industries including healthcare, aviation, textiles, detergents and plastics. Based in the US and with 62 entities in 22 countries worldwide, it currently has 11,300 employees.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>When Huntsman was founded in 1970 it had a turnover of $12,000. Since then, this figure has grown to $12 billion. This rapid growth has largely been achieved through acquisitions, including Texaco Chemical Company in 1994, three divisions of ICI in 1999 and the Vantico Group in 2003. As a result, Huntsman has been faced with the issue of integrating these acquired entities and divisions into the existing company structure. Along with the acquisitions came a variety of banks, different bank account structures, different electronic banking applications and different ERP systems. Legal entities were operating in a decentralised, self-standing way, with each subsidiary responsible for invoicing customers and paying suppliers.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…solved</h2>
<p>In recent years, the company has been working towards standardisation, simplification and centralisation. Regarding corporate structure, Huntsman was reorganised from three parent companies into one. From the point of view of IT infrastructure, the company chose SAP as its standard and moved almost all the businesses to this platform. In order to simplify and centralise administrative processes the company introduced the SBE (Single Business Entity) concept in Europe. As part of the standardisation process, Huntsman also chose a centralised approach for its treasury structure. Huntsman’s European cash management business was centralised in Brussels using one main bank throughout Europe. A payment factory was also set up in one single entity in order to manage payments from a central point for various businesses.</p>
<p>In 2003, Huntsman went out to tender and chose Deutsche Bank as its main cash management bank in Europe. The decision was based on the key criteria of products and services, pricing and geographical coverage in Huntsman’s countries of operation. Peter Vanderpoorten, Director of Global Treasury Services at Huntsman, identifies two key roles performed by Deutsche Bank. “Firstly, as our main bank in Europe, they not only helped us to set up the European cash pools, but they also supported us with our plan to set up payment factories – how to organise them and how to implement one uniform payment format, the IDOC file.” The second role is to assist with the integration of acquisitions. “When you have a main bank you are true partners. When we make acquisitions, we contact Deutsche Bank very early on to think with us and to give their opinions and alternatives in order to best integrate the new company into existing treasury structures.”</p>
<p>On the liquidity side, Huntsman worked with Deutsche Bank to implement cash pools in different currencies for the European entities. The next step was to set up a payment factory. “Instead of having various banks with different communication tools and payment formats we decided to go for a uniform solution,” explains Vanderpoorten. “As Deutsche Bank was already our cash management provider in several countries it was possible to use the same payment procedure with the uniform payment format, i.e. the IDOC format. The fact that Deutsche Bank is SAP certified and that they are able to accept IDOC files, as they are produced by our SAP system, made the integration easier. So now a payment request is approved locally and is sent to the central entity, which automatically loads this payment request into db-direct internet.” Ultimately, Vanderpoorten plans to use two or more payment factories in Europe – at least one in Holland and one in the UK. “There is a limit to centralisation, driven by business or tax or legal reasons. You cannot centralise everything.”</p>
<p>As a company driven by acquisitions, the integration of new subsidiaries is also of key importance to Huntsman. In March 2006, it decided to acquire Ciba’s Textile Effects division, a deal which is set to be completed during 2006. Vanderpoorten explains that Deutsche Bank is helping Huntsman to prepare for this. “We will need to set up new bank accounts and integrate them in our cash pool or maybe rethink our existing structure in light of the new created situation and therefore Deutsche Bank is involved early in the game to check what is possible, what is not. We will work closely together with them to decide upon the best solution.”</p>

<p>Newly established BenQ Mobile needed to implement a cash management system in less than three months, including a complete accounts, payments and electronic banking infrastructure.

<img alt=""BenQ Mobile"" class=""logo org"" height="""" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/benq-mobile-logo-2006-100x15.png"" width=""""/>

<p>BenQ Corporation is an international producer of consumer electronics, mobile phones, computers and digital storage technology. In October 2005, BenQ acquired Siemens Mobile Devices and set up the Munich-based company BenQ Mobile, which is licensed to use the Siemens brand name until October 2010. BenQ Mobile has over 7,000 employees worldwide and has R and D facilities in Brazil, China, Denmark, Germany, Mexico, Poland and Taiwan.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>Following the acquisition of Siemens Mobile Devices in October 2005, BenQ Corporation set up a new company in Europe called BenQ Mobile. As the company was to be established in less than three months, a new cash management system needed to be implemented in a short space of time, including a complete accounts, payments and electronic banking infrastructure.</p>
<p>This task was particularly daunting due to the sheer number of countries involved in the process. “Because the acquisition deal was an asset deal, in every country BenQ bought the assets of the business and not the infrastructure. We had to open up a new company and a new accounts structure behind it in 25 different countries,” explains Manfred Eisenhuth, Head of Treasury at BenQ Mobile. The task of setting up the new accounts structure was further complicated by the fact that BenQ Mobile did not yet have employees in all the required countries, while the existing Siemens Mobile Devices employees were not allowed to act on behalf of BenQ Mobile.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>Eisenhuth studied the market and found that Deutsche Bank was the only bank that offered to create the new cash management structure in a short enough timeframe. “Deutsche Bank managed to open active accounts in all those countries within a few weeks, including all legal documentation,” says Eisenhuth. “This was very important because we had to be able to make and receive payments and provide our customers with the new account information. Deutsche Bank was very aware of our time constraints.” Deutsche Bank managed the process of opening the accounts by providing points of contact in the countries in question, as well as a central point of contact at Deutsche Bank Frankfurt who liaised with the local contacts to ensure that the accounts were opened on time.</p>
<p>Eisenhuth also wanted to achieve a centralised cash management structure, including a cross-border cash pool and a local cash pool in Germany. BenQ Mobile’s transactions are processed via finavigate®, the central platform provided by Siemens Financial Services. Deutsche Bank (DB) enabled this by integrating BenQ Mobile’s payments into db-worldPAS, which converts payment files into the appropriate local domestic formats. “If Portugal wants to pay something from their local account, they send us a payment file out of their SAP system and we process it via finavigate® and send it to DB. DB then executes the payment out of DB Portugal,” explains Eisenhuth. “For the whole organisation in Europe there is a single point of entry for DB and their system. Everything is processed internally, so we can process every kind of payment within DB via one access point.”</p>
<p>Above all, Eisenhuth was impressed with the speed at which Deutsche Bank implemented the new structure. “They were very helpful, very fast and very creative. They did a good job on their side and we’re very happy about that.”</p>

<p>Global satellite group, SES Global SA, had to find a cash management provider with a strong US dollar presence following the  acquisition of GE Americom, which turned it into the world’s largest satellite operator.  Detuche Bank helped the company manage its US dollar positions for both its European operations as well as its newly acquired operations.</p>


<h4 class=""fn"">Walter Dilewyns</h4>
<h5 class=""title"">Group Treasurer</h5>
<img alt=""SES Global"" class=""logo org"" height=""18"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/ses-global-logo-2006-120x18.png"" width=""120""/>

<p>SES Global SA is the world’s leading satellite group, encompassing a network of satellite operators worldwide and offering global coverage reaching 95% of the world’s population. In 2001, SES acquired GE Americom in the United States and moved from being the biggest European satellite company to become the world’s largest satellite operator.</p>
<p>In Europe, SES ASTRA is the leading provider of direct-to-home broadcast services, distributing more than 1,400 TV and radio channels to 103 million homes. SES AMERICOM transmits TV and radio programming to virtually every US cable household and also covers Latin America. Further services provided by SES Global SA include corporate data networks and communications solutions, as well as mobile broadband services.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>SES Global SA is based in Europe, with both its headquarters and centralised treasury located in Luxembourg. The treasury is mainly responsible for group financing and hedging currency risks. SES Global invoices its European customers mainly in euros and its US customers in US dollars. However, there are significant US dollar flows out of Europe mainly related to financing and hedging activities.</p>
<p>SES Global historically ran centralised cash management operations in Luxembourg. After the acquisition of GE Americom, intragroup funding and cash management had to be executed using inter-company loans. Cross-border payments were initiated out of Europe to the US-based SES AMERICOM unit whenever the US balance sheet was in a deficit position.</p>
<p>Walter Dilewyns, Group Treasurer at SES Global SA, explains: “We could not effectively combine different US dollar flows, because you cannot operate with cross-border payments on a daily basis. It was quite important for us to start a form of cash pooling, as without it, the different operations have a tendency to build up pockets of money.”</p>
<p>In its efforts to centralise its US dollar liquidity position globally, SES Global SA’s objective was to create a regional US dollar cash pool for its European operations and to centralise its position in the US as well.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>Searching for a cash management provider with strong US dollar presence, SES Global SA considered proposals from multiple banks. Dilewyns said, “You have to look at several factors, such as the bank’s locations and tax considerations around the cash pool. We liked Deutsche Bank’s solution, which brought these aspects together.”</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas created a cash pooling structure that enabled SES Global SA to concentrate its global US dollar position in New York. Deutsche Bank’s US dollar Global Cash Concentration service centralises SES Global SA’s US dollar funds in a single account structure under the umbrella of the parent company’s control. By doing so, Deutsche Bank provided the means for SES Global SA to manage its US dollar positions for both its European operating entities as well as its US-based division, SES AMERICOM.</p>
<p>SES Global SA now has the ability to concentrate daily end-of-day surplus balances into New York, or conversely for New York to cover a deficit position in Europe, on a same-day basis. Deutsche Bank also keeps track of the daily cash balance for the participants of the pool so that the integrity of the separate entity positions remains, but SES Global SA can operate as if there is one single US dollar cash pool.</p>
<p>“We basically have built what I call a ‘transatlantic cash pool’, bringing two accounts of the parent company together in NY. One account concentrates all US flows and the other account consolidates all the European flows. These are then brought together in a notional pool, which has the advantage of not mingling the US with the European funds.”</p>
<p>Benefiting from Deutsche Bank’s centralised global US dollar liquidity management solution, SES Global SA is now in a position to move US dollar liquidity cross-border on a same-day basis to where it is needed – predominantly into the US. Same-day liquidity offers SES Global SA greater flexibility in the funding of US operations and also ensures that shortfalls are covered by the European entities, thereby reducing dependence on costly credit lines.</p>

<p>The Gillette Company has over 28,000 employees and its products are distributed in more than 200 countries. In 2004, Gillette’s revenue was over $10 billion. Best known as the leading global manufacturer of shaving supplies, Gillette has a wide range of products including alkaline batteries, toiletries and oral care products. The company has recently been acquired by Procter and Gamble.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>Gillette’s treasury is divided between two locations. The Boston treasury manages longer term transactions such as intercompany pricing, long-term financing, strategic hedging, insurance and risk management, while the Zurich treasury manages short-term transactions and acts as Gillette’s in-house bank. As well as dealing with centralised exposure hedging and executing inter-company transactions, the Zurich treasury acts as a payment factory, handling cross-border payments for the Gillette entities worldwide.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the millennium, Gillette found itself with a cash management structure including over 30 bank relationships and an unwieldy assortment of systems. The Zurich treasury team was keen to find a centralised solution in order to streamline processes and reduce costs. Furthermore, Gillette had decided to implement a Shared Service Centre project in order to concentrate domestic accounts payables and banking management to one location based on a single SAP instance for the entire region. The goal was to drive further efficiencies in the A/P and A/R processes. However, the focus was on finding a single banking partner that could meet their technology requirements necessary to implement an effective centralisation solution.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>After considering various banks’ proposals, Gillette decided that Deutsche Bank was the best match for their requirements. Deutsche offered a comprehensive solution based on advanced systems and processing capabilities, especially when it came to directly interfacing with the treasury and SAP platform, satisfying the needs of both the in-house bank and the Shared Service Centre set-up. So Deutsche Bank was appointed to execute Gillette’s pan-European activities, including the cash pooling structure and A/P and A/R activities throughout the region.</p>
<p>In terms of the pure treasury activities, all FX settlement payments are now processed through Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt and managed by Gillette’s in-house bank in Zurich. Local third-party payments have been moved to a central solution, improving the FX management and control and providing an improved cash management pricing structure.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the A/P and A/R activities of the company throughout Western Europe have been centralised at Gillette’s Financial Shared Service Centre (FSSC) in the UK in order to manage the bank accounts for more than 20 European entities centrally based on SAP. Mike Widmer, Director of Global Cash Management in Zurich, explains: “The FSSC centralised all the financial activities that remain in the entities but are not directly treasury related – like accounts payable and bank reconciliations.” Before the FSSC was in place, more than 30 different banks were being used, as well as a wide range of different software packages and interfaces with the accounting systems. By choosing to go with a single provider, Gillette established an account structure across Western Europe with Deutsche Bank so that the accounts could be managed centrally through one standardised SAP IDOC interface. FSSC now manages all European domestic payables and receivables via just one file format and file transfer link through Deutsche Bank’s browser-based electronic banking platform, db-direct internet, without the need for any file conversion on the Gillette side.</p>
<p>The implementation process was not without its challenges. “We had to deal with a lot of country-specific regulations,” explains Karin Amacher, Assistant Director of Global Cash Management at Gillette. However, Widmer and Amacher were impressed by Deutsche Bank’s flexibility in managing such a complex project and by their committed approach to feedback.</p>
<p>From Widmer’s point of view, there is always an element of risk involved in using just one bank to implement a large-scale cash management programme. “In a pan-European solution you lose a certain amount of flexibility and when you want to change banks it’s a huge project. So that’s another good reason to be really careful about which bank you go for.” But Widmer feels that he did his homework and got the results he wanted. “The benefits of having one bank are huge.” Furthermore, both Amacher and Widmer have been impressed by the level of customer service Deutsche Bank offers. “They don’t ask the customer to adjust to the banking system – they really try to adjust wherever they can to accommodate all the customer’s requirements. Even by setting up a new process.”</p>

<p>Changes in the US Internal Revenue Service and revised data protection laws made it a huge task to distribute tax refunds to its investors.  However, Dresdner Bank’s bespoke tax refund collection service, solved the company’s problem by enabling the receipt of electronic ACH payments.</p>

<p>Ideenkapital AG, a 100% subsidiary of ERGO-Group, develops and distributes high yield financial investment products. The company’s product portfolio comprises closed-end funds investing in US and European real estate, media, alternative energy, ship finance and life insurance products. In addition to Ideenkapital’s investment products for institutional investors, the company has a business to business distribution agreement with banks, savings banks and other financial institutions that offer its financial products to private investors.</p>


<h2 id=""problem"">Problem…</h2>
<p>Ideenkapital provides German investors with a range of closed-end US real estate investment funds. All investors in these funds have to effect tax prepayments on their investment income. Due to a US-German double taxation treaty, most investors will qualify for a tax return once they have filed a tax declaration with the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS). These tax returns are paid electronically via ACH within the US. However, according to an internal IRS rule, tax refunds to non-US accounts can only be paid by cheque. As a result, the fund initiator received 13,000 annual tax return cheques.</p>
<p>Before the cheques could be forwarded, they had to be manually processed into the company’s ERP system and reconciled with each investor’s data. The cumbersome manual process of matching and reconciling tax refunds with individual investor data was further complicated when new data protection regulations were introduced in the US. These regulations prohibited the IRS from printing the investor’s personal tax number on the cheque. The costs arising from manual processing, reconciling and managing exceptions increased exponentially with the number of cheques that had to be handled.</p>
<p>Ideenkapital’s Frank Figiel, at the time MD of the fund initiator’s Client Service division, investigated several possible solutions. “We could have easily opened a trust account in the US and redistributed the payments from there. However, the IRS only allows 10 annual payments to any single bank account in a year, in order to prevent fraud. At the same time, asking all investors in US funds to open a bank account in the US was clearly not an option.”</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>Figiel approached Dresdner Bank, seeking a solution. “It was only natural to approach Dresdner Bank, as the bank was already a strong partner in the distribution of our US emitted funds.”</p>
<p>Dresdner developed a bespoke tax refund collection service to increase the reliability, efficiency and transparency of tax refund collections, by enabling the receipt of electronic ACH payments. To avoid the IRS rule that prohibits more than 10 payments to an individual bank account per year, Dresdner Bank came up with a solution that involves the use of virtual accounts for all of Ideenkapital’s US funds investors. Ideenkapital had to open one account with Dresdner’s New York (DBNY) branch. Each investor then received a virtual account number composed of: a tag for the fund initiator; the tax year; and the investor’s personal tax number. This information, together with DBNY’s ABA routing number, necessary for funds transfers in the US, is included in the tax declaration prepared by Ideenkapital’s US tax advisor on behalf of each investor.</p>
<p>The tax declaration instructs the IRS to pay any tax refunds electronically to the respective virtual accounts of the investors. When Dresdner’s banking system recognises a payment to a virtual account number, it automatically transfers the funds to Ideenkapital’s New York account. The system simultaneously copies additional payment information – consisting of the investor’s name and tax number – onto a SWIFT MT940 balance statement. This allows the fund initiator to book and reconcile the payment information in its ERP system. Incoming payments can now also be matched against a bulk file sent by the company’s US tax advisor – a process that greatly facilitates the detection of errors.</p>
<p>Once a week all funds from Ideenkapital’s New York account are transferred to the fund initiator’s German account, from which the tax refunds can be paid out to the investors. “Most of the investors would like to receive their tax refund in euro. The tax refund collection service now enables us to meet these requests. We can offer three different payment methods:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Conversion into euro and payment via the cheaper German domestic system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Payment transfer in USD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>USD bank order cheque sent by post</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Dresdner’s tax refund collection service helped us reduce manual matching and processing costs. The service has also improved the monitoring of payments and the management of exceptions. Most importantly, it results in faster payments to investors via a payment method of their choice.”</p>

<p>For tax reasons, Raisio was using a specific payment method for Finnish farmers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Composite debit statements were needed in order to ease the reconciliation process.</p>

</ol>
<p>In order to incorporate Raisio in the company’s cash management solution, Ciba had to upgrade its system capability to process these payment types in the EDIFACT message format.</p>


<h2 id=""solved"">…Solved</h2>
<p>Already using Deutsche Bank’s single window payments infrastucture and its regional liquidity management across Europe, Ciba wanted to integrate Raisio Chemicals into the existing payments and cash concentration agreements. “Acquiring new entities in other countries means that the account landscape needs to be streamlined in order to achieve an integration into the existing pool and a seamless interface to Ciba’s system,” explains Dr Stefan Eggli, Head of Treasury Control at Ciba. “But the good thing is because we work with one partner in Europe there is no discussion about how we will do this. In the case of Raisio Chemicals, we knew exactly what we wanted to have, so that avoided any discussion about which bank we should go with.”</p>
<p>Ciba went to Deutsche Bank and used the bank’s single file payment channel to transmit local payments and other local requirements. “We tried to integrate the payments as an EDIFACT message,” says Eggli. “When we started with the project, Deutsche Bank’s system didn’t support the processing of the very specific local requirements. However, a mutual solution was found in conjunction with Deutsche’s local partner in order to support this payment format for the Nordics.” In conjunction with this, Deutsche Bank also helped Ciba to specify the technical requirements needed to support this internally.</p>
<p>Finally, the domestic Finnish pool had to be integrated into Ciba’s existing Euro pool. Deutsche Bank implemented a sweep trigger balance/cover trigger balance in order to meet the local cash needs, ie transferring or covering when the trigger amounts were reached. They also helped Ciba to meet all legal requirements and provided the appropriate documentation for the integration.</p>
<p>Throughout this process, implementation management and customer service is a key area where Deutsche Bank has stood out for Eggli. “Working with customer support is always difficult. You call their customer support and have to spell your name and the first thing that you get is a ticket number.” This is not the case in Ciba’s experience with Deutsche Bank. “Where they are really good is with their ongoing support. They run a centralised implementation and support centre in Frankfurt. The people working there know Ciba Specialty Chemicals very well – they know about our problems, they know about potential improvements and we’ve been talking to the same key people since we started with the Euro pool.</p>
<p>“Deutsche Bank says it has ‘a passion to perform’. And I think that’s true.”</p>
