<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>In today’s dynamic world, treasurers’ expectations of the banking experience are changing rapidly. As Lucia Li, Global Market Management, Wholesale Payments at J.P. Morgan, explains: “Clients are looking for an intuitive and seamless experience that enables people to focus on what’s really important for them.”</p>
<p>She notes that this represents a convergence of the consumer banking experience and the wholesale banking experience. In the consumer world, people are used to being able to access balance information via banking apps and take advantage of self-service options, as well as being able to speak to their banks when needed. Increasingly, treasurers expect the same capabilities – and they also expect to be able to access a wide range of banking services in a streamlined and convenient way.</p>
<p>As such, organisations need to have access to a range of connectivity options, including plug-and-play bank platforms, treasury management and ERP systems, and customised bank connections. And there is also a continuing focus on the banking capabilities that can solve perennial treasury challenges, such as gaining visibility over cash, accessing liquidity, automating processes and freeing up working capital.</p>
<h4 id=""shifting-sands"">Shifting sands</h4>
<p>During the pandemic, many companies have had to pivot their business models at short notice. Li cites the example of a business-to-business client that had to switch rapidly to a direct-to-consumer model – “and now we’re working with them to help them make that pivot permanent, from ensuring the company can accept customer payments, to understanding the impact on the company’s liquidity and supply chain.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, banks have acted rapidly to address another of the challenges treasurers have faced during the crisis: the need for a physical signature. “Before the pandemic, everything had to have wet signatures,” says Jennifer Fedora, head of North America Client Service, Wholesale Payments. “In the retail space, people could already use virtual signatures through products like DocuSign. So we immediately pivoted to avoid wet signatures and have got most clients onto e-signatures.”</p>
<p>Fedora notes that other recent developments include a greater focus on enabling corporate clients to track their payments in real-time, as well as the development of Virtual Assistant tools for corporate banking. The adoption of APIs has been another important focus, with the number of users taking advantage of J.P. Morgan’s APIs rising by 60% during the early weeks of the crisis.</p>
<p>Much progress has been made – but are these changes here to stay? Li argues that recent developments such as the rise of e-signatures “are a one-way shift”, adding that the urgency brought by the crisis has meant that projects that would previously have taken months to complete are now just taking days. “That sense of urgency is really important,” she adds. “Our clients are talking a lot about how they can keep that momentum going forward, and continue to benefit from shorter decision times and execution times.”</p>
<h4 id=""emerging-stronger"">Emerging stronger</h4>
<p>While the crisis has brought numerous challenges, Li says that clients “are now looking forward to 2021 and asking how they can emerge stronger.” She adds: “This means improving visibility and unlocking their sources of liquidity, whether they’re undergoing a business model pivot, embarking on M&amp;A; or looking at their holistic supply chain strategy.”</p>
<p>For J.P. Morgan, Fedora says the crisis has intensified the need for global consistency, with a particular focus on achieving a seamless country-to-country relationship model. “The other thing that’s been a big pain point for our clients is the need for resiliency modelling,” she says. “For example, this week I’ve been working with one of our clients on how to build them a resiliency model playbook to help them adopt best practices.”</p>
<p>As they focus on the coming year, companies are also paying close attention to fraud. “Fraudsters are getting smarter – so we’ve done at least 50 different fraud workshops to make sure that our clients can get ahead of this,” says Fedora.</p>
<p>Banks, meanwhile, are looking closely at how to provide the level of transparency and real-time visibility that clients increasingly expect. “One of the big areas of focus for us has been on how we get information that we have as relationship managers to our other partners around the world, so that we can continue to support our clients effectively,” Fedora comments. “That means tracking information, documenting information so that our clients have that seamless experience, and then making sure that clients have the right solutions.”</p>
<h4 id=""supporting-clients-effectively"">Supporting clients effectively</h4>
<p>Investing in innovation has proved crucial when it comes to supporting clients in times of crisis. “As a firm, we invest US$12bn every year in technology, and 40% of that is spent on innovative technology,” says Li. “This has really helped during the crisis – within the first three weeks, we had more than 40 instances where the investments we’d already made in our solutions and digital capabilities were able to help our clients solve some of their most urgent problems, include making payroll in a virtual environment.”</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan’s other achievements during the crisis include onboarding one client onto APIs in only nine working days, accelerating the launch of the bank’s self-service Payment Tracker Tool, and expanding its Virtual Assistant tool from 3,000 users to over 200,000 users in a matter of weeks.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Fedora and Li emphasise the importance of building strong relationships in a virtual environment. As well as enabling treasurers to share their views on key topics via client roundtable discussions, maintaining a social connection is also crucial. “We’ve had client meetings which have been about having a connection that focuses more on the human side,  and letting them know we’re still here,” Li explains. “As you look towards 2021, it’s more important than ever to build trust in this uncertain world.”</p>

What does a digital world mean for banking in Asia?,"


<p><em>Even pre-COVID, parts of the Asian banking sector were going through turmoil. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, businesses and banks alike were thrown into uncertainty. So what exactly has the pandemic done to banking in Asia, what will happen after, and what should treasurers look out for?</em></p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>It’s true that the Asian banking sector is going through a fair amount of turmoil – for example, a tough macroeconomic environment, geopolitical challenges and trade wars to name a few. But, according to McKinsey, it’s also true that more than 40 of the world’s largest banks by assets are Asian, and account for approximately 50% of the market capitalisation of the top 100 banks globally. Additionally, the continent has been the world’s largest regional banking market for a decade.</p>
<p>Digital banking is the future, and that’s particularly true for Asia Pacific (APAC). “Asia is digital,” says Development Asia, an initiative of Asian Development Bank, and this is seen through the push by Asian central banks to digitise economies – including demonetisation in India and a cashless economy in Thailand – as well as the fact that eight Asian countries are among the top ten countries for mobile payments in the world (six of them in Southeast Asia), thanks to the likes of Alipay and WeChat Pay. In the banking space, the past few years has seen newly licensed digital banks, global digital-only banks and digitalised traditional banks competing across the region.</p>
<p>S&amp;P noted in July 2019 that these developments have not caused “any noteworthy changes” to its outlooks for banking sector country risks across the region, and estimated that virtual banking may not lead to rating or outlook changes for APAC banks over the following two years. Over a longer period, however, it noted that “as virtual banking strategies take hold and further disrupt the traditional bank sector, the potential for ratings differentiation is greater.”</p>
<h4 id=""driving-to-digital"">Driving to digital</h4>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has, for many, accelerated the drive for digitalisation in banking, as companies struggled to complete necessary paperwork while working from home and keeping physical interactions to a minimum. In April 2020, the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) issued a collection of rapid response measures by trade finance banks to keep trade finance and trade flowing. It included guidance on issues such as the inability to gain wet signatures or witnesses for secure documents, as well as electronic Bills of Lading being unrecognised in many jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The move to digitalisation has been welcomed by corporate treasurers across the region, says Sonia Clifton-Bligh, Director, Regional Treasury Services Centre Asia Pacific at Johnson &amp; Johnson. This is particularly true for treasurers of multinational companies, who might need a signatory in another country. “There’s no certainty or security in sending paperwork around the world,” she says. Clifton-Bligh notes that the company regularly interacts digitally within itself and sister organisations, “even if it’s just digital signatures”, which she believes are often more secure than wet ones, owing to the ability to trace and verify where they came from.</p>
<p>Rajesh Mehta, Asia Pacific Head of Treasury and Trade Solutions at Citi, also notes that “the pandemic has further placed e-commerce and online commerce in the spotlight” and that he is seeing a “significant increase in interest and dialogue on digitising strategies”. Additionally, he has noticed that in the “always-on economy” the world is in, appreciation of digitalisation is especially found in regard to having a real-time treasury.</p>
<h4 id=""keeping-connected"">Keeping connected</h4>
<p>As the pandemic struck, a key challenge for many corporate treasurers came in the form of significant liquidity and working capital pressures, says Mehta. Indeed, the situation has been referred to as a “liquidity crisis” by multiple outlets, and the Big Four accounting firms have all issued guidance on how to manage.</p>
<p>“At the onset of the pandemic, we helped clients to prioritise urgent payments and flows, ensure continuity of business with our digital platforms and capabilities, for example digital account opening, and supported their financing needs by speedily facilitating solutions,” says Mehta. He also notes that banks have had to take on stronger advisory components during the pandemic and have actually strengthened their relationships with clients.</p>
<p>Mehta explains that embracing digital communication methods has allowed for the delivery of various country and regional webinars in APAC, with attendees from areas and countries that may not usually be able to attend. This has enabled banks to offer best practice solutions to a wider audience, and also given corporates a platform to share their own experiences and keep connected with the wider treasury community.</p>
<h4 id=""knowing-the-business"">Knowing the business</h4>
<p>Clifton-Bligh also thinks banking relationships have strengthened, largely because of the banks that were proactive when it came to sharing information and being a valuable partner to the business. “Certainly in the early days, there were a couple of banks that shared how various industries were being impacted, which was really helpful,” she explains. In addition, she thinks value comes from banks that reach out to their treasurer clients to ensure they get to know the business. “I’m always looking for a true partner in my banking relationships,” she says. “Someone who knows my business beyond just KYC. Do they know who our competitors are, what the economic and regulatory factors that impact us are?”</p>
<p>That knowledge of regulations is something that Clifton-Bligh feels is especially imperative as a treasurer in APAC. With myriad regulatory profiles in the region, compliance can become complicated for regional treasurers. “It feels like regulations are released by the minute, so I don’t want a bank to just throw one at me, but interpret it for me,” she says. “Then I know that they understand who I am as a business, as well.”</p>
<p>A 2017 Transaction Banking Survey conducted by Temenos and Ovum found that 80% of corporates are willing to change their banks for those that offer better servicing and products. For Clifton-Bligh, this demonstrates that treasurers want their banks to be value-adding partners – and are willing to look elsewhere when necessary.</p>
<h4 id=""one-step-forward"">One step forward…</h4>
<p>Despite the obvious want and need for digital interactions, as lockdowns begin to ease, Clifton-Bligh has noticed the situation beginning to revert. “We are communicating with banks digitally for things like sending instructions, but we’re now still following up with the paperwork and have couriers going back and forth,” she explains. “The banks that wanted paperwork before, still want paperwork. They just deferred the need for it until borders opened and people went back to offices.”</p>
<p>However, Clifton-Bligh is hopeful that change could be on the horizon and that the recent need for digitalisation could have whetted the appetite of banks and corporates alike. She explains that several banks have client councils and treasury boards, in which the topic of digitalisation is often raised. “I hope that somebody is observing that we’ve managed digitally when we’ve needed to, and sees that we just need to ensure we firm up the controls around digitalisation, in order to continue in this vein,” she says.</p>
<h4 id=""utilising-new-technologies"">Utilising new technologies</h4>
<p>Mehta is optimistic that the acceleration of digitalisation will be an area of focus across all businesses post-pandemic. “We have seen a significant acceleration in the adoption of our digital capabilities and platforms, from remote connectivity to digital account opening,” he explains, noting that Citi opened over 1,000 corporate accounts digitally in Asia in Q1 20. He adds that the number of accounts onboarded digitally in the region has increased ten-fold year-on-year between the first half of 2020 and the same period in 2019. In addition, the number of users for the digital banking mobile app for corporates has gone up by eight times in the same period.</p>
<p>One area of digitalisation that’s been gaining traction in APAC is real-time payments, and Mehta believes COVID-19 has only strengthened this trend. “The pandemic has coerced businesses to rethink and change conventional collections models, given the accelerated shift from offline to online,” he says. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning are revolutionising how these new features can be kept efficient and secure, and Mehta is excited to see where the space will move next.</p>
<h4 id=""planning-for-the-future"">Planning for the future</h4>
<p>Looking at banking opportunities for the future, Clifton-Bligh comes back to the importance of partnering with a bank that understands the business. She says key questions treasurers should be asking banks are: “Who are we? What do we do? What do you think is important to us? How can you help me to help my business?”</p>
<p>Mehta also believes that more than ever, clients will be basing their choice of banking relationships on the ability of the bank to support them effectively, should a crisis occur again. “Operational resilience will be central to this decision,” he says. “Treasurers will need and want to know what measures and capabilities are in place to ensure that things remain contained in the event of a crisis.”</p>
<p>Echoing Clifton-Bligh’s advice, Mehta thinks treasurers will want solutions that are sharper, better informed, and more sophisticated as they tackle increasing risks in the operating environment, both now and in the future. “This includes diversifying supply chains, creating redundancy across manufacturing and service footprints, and maintaining continuous access to payments, funding and investment,” he says.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The financial services world is changing rapidly, none more so than payments. Every bank in this space should already be responding to the transformational, innovative and fundamental change that open banking and APIs will bring, through ground-breaking solutions such as request-to-pay, the rise of corporate in-house banking, as well as the emergence of ‘big tech’ players becoming financial service providers.</p>
<p>Managed well, these transformative events, and others that will follow, are an opportunity for all stakeholders. But only those that have the vision to embrace new technologies alongside the imagination to form collaborative relationships will be able to fully meet the needs of ever-more demanding customers.</p>
<h4 id=""open-invitation"">Open invitation</h4>
<p>In terms of major impact, ‘open banking’ is in the upper reaches, says Joanne Towers, Managing Director, Europe Regional Head of Payments and Cards, Global Liquidity and Cash Management, HSBC.</p>
<p>Derived from CMA rules in the UK and the EU’s PSD2, the idea of promoting competition and growth in the payments space through technology took off in 2018. With it now comes a regulatory framework protecting consumers and a whole new opportunity for third parties, including the ability to connect consumer and corporate payments, and payments data, to the individual customer experience through an increasing number of channels. This, Towers explains, puts the customer in far more control of their transactional data, across all of their accounts; something that would not have been possible just a few years ago.</p>
<p>Although a regulatory play in Europe, open banking in North America and Asia has had a more commercial driving force, notes Towers. ‘Big tech’ players are increasingly engaging with their markets on the payments front, as they seek to bring about greater ownership of the customer experience.</p>
<p>By steering the development of a payments infrastructure that offers an end-to-end customer journey, where the payments process is but one step in an extended data-driven purchasing ‘event’, they are indeed taking that ownership to new levels.</p>
<p>But whilst it may look like the payments space is heading for a ‘bank versus non-bank’ showdown, Towers believes that it really is an opportunity for all stakeholders to collaborate for the greater good.</p>
<h4 id=""guided tour"">Guided tour</h4>
<p>As an example, she reports that where a corporate is seeking cost efficiencies by adopting an in-house banking and centralised treasury strategy, it will still be looking to its bank as a trusted advisor. “We can guide them through that journey, helping them best understand the changes and the new technologies, such as APIs or virtual accounts that facilitate a move to their new structure,” she explains.</p>
<p>In the big tech and retail sectors too, these businesses are still looking to embed banks within their own infrastructures as vital components of their end-customers’ payments journey. The banks necessarily bring the expertise and resilience in clearing, for example, because non-FIs are not as well-placed to navigate the increased regulation and risk in this space.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to banks partnering with smaller fintechs, challenges remain, notes Towers. It’s right that a bank will seek to leverage the undeniable expertise of the fintech community, but it can be difficult for the individual vendor to demonstrate that it has the necessary resilience and scalability demanded by the bank on behalf of its clients.</p>
<p>To help overcome this, HSBC has invested and worked with a number of select providers, and in doing so, enabled development of both the fintech as a business, and it’s product-set. HSBC aims to partner with the vendor until such time as they have grown sufficiently to stand on their own two feet, benefiting both the vendor and the wider market in the process.</p>
<p>It’s through this collaborative mindset that the customer will ultimately benefit. Michèle Zaquine, Head of Payments Advisory, Europe, HSBC, observes a number of different market participants – including fintechs, insurers, aggregators, big techs, challenger and virtual banks – which are all busy evolving discrete ecosystems. But driven in part by the wider push for real-time information, many of these players, she notes, are working towards ecosystem interaction – a kind of network of networks – so that not only do they serve their own needs but also, by intersecting at certain points, they serve a wider set of demands.</p>
<p>This spirit of collaboration extends to corporate clients where they seek guidance from banking and technology experts on how best to achieve their strategic goals. “We are seeing some traditional corporates – driven by the demands that PSD2 places on the new digital services they are providing – requiring e-money provider licences,” notes Towers. “As a result of these new structures, clients look to us in particular to manage the regulatory requirements around these, and to provide appropriate solutions, across account and liquidity structures within their payments and receivables architecture.”</p>
<p>Where the provision of new banking services and technology appears to be pushing the boundaries of the traditional bank-client relationship, it is changing the dynamic of the relationship. “We’re very much a partner at the table with them now,” she says.</p>
<h4 id=""driving-force"">Driving force</h4>
<p>Some banks are naturally more open to collaboration than others. The so-called challenger banks on the high street, for example, only know this way of operation. The difference between consumer and corporate banking may seem clear, for now.</p>
<p>Retail banking has to deliver excellent service and an embedded digital offering – consumers demand it – and so it needs total customer awareness and agile development teams. But whilst consumer banking has been driven far harder than its corporate counterpart into the collaborative model, that gap is closing. This is notably so as a seamless digital experience, where APIs and real-time payments begin pushing this model on the corporate side.</p>
<p>Arguably, the translation of consumer attitudes into the corporate world is inescapable. Corporate customers, informed by their own consumer experiences, want to be able to order and pay in real-time. As real-time expectations rise, so more corporates need to be able to accept payments and progress orders accordingly. This effect has been notably gathering momentum in Asia, with big tech providers offering dedicated payment services to retailers.</p>
<p>“Companies need to be able to offer on-demand payment services and be able to reconcile information in the background,” says Towers. “Real-time payments has made everyone change their expectations; everything needs to be ‘now’.”</p>
<p>It’s easy to plot its progress. Contactless payments existed for many years before they took off. Now, with mobile options such as Apple Pay and Google Pay, the move towards electronic payment solutions for e-commerce and collections, is taking a rapid leap forwards in most markets. The next big step, certainly in Europe, is request-to-pay. In the UK, the service is already being driven by industry authorities as part of the New Payments Architecture. Continental Europe, too, has a SEPA-driven variant; a number of hybrid versions are also emerging elsewhere.</p>
<p>“I think it will dramatically change the electronic payments landscape,” says Towers. “It won’t completely change the card space, for example, because they are embedded into so many markets. But request-to-pay puts people in control of their own transactions; they can even use an instant payment at point-of-sale without a card.” Whether it removes cash, cheques or direct debits remains to be seen but, she asserts, request-to-pay is set to be a “transformative offering”.</p>
<h4 id=""getting-what-you-want-not-what-youre-given"">Getting what you want, not what you’re given</h4>
<p>One challenge with request-to-pay is the current lack of standardisation across solutions and markets. With individual banks and fintechs jockeying for position, the motivation to get it right is in plain sight: if it proves not to be frictionless for customers, it will not be adopted.</p>
<p>The idea that any new technology is fit for purpose pushes treasury involvement to the fore. Banks such as HSBC are working in partnership with treasurers from a wide variety of corporate clients. “We discuss and advise so we can get to the right solution in partnership with them,” says Towers. “Gone are the days when bankers told treasurers what they were going to give them. Today, we need to discover what the changes are that the client wants and needs to make as part of their business, and then work to see how we can support them with the right solutions to achieve those changes.”</p>
<p>Banks know that no treasurer will implement new technology for the sake of it. Real-time payments and collections may be the hot topic, but it is not needed in every case. It is therefore incumbent upon the bank and client to explore the most appropriate solution.</p>
<p>Although that discussion may be driven from unexpected angles – perhaps better use of working capital can be achieved by using a corporate or purchasing card solution, or maybe treasury prefers the predictability and control offered by direct debits – Towers believes that real-time is coming, simply because end-customers want it.</p>
<p>Zaquine adds that every business receiving funds 24/7 not only needs to think deeply about how to manage its working capital and intra-day liquidity positions, but also to consider the cyber-security and fraud angle.</p>
<p>Indeed, with every stakeholder needing to grasp the realities of new ideas such as open banking and real-time information, the discussion should now focus on how to evolve and grow together. Solution providers – banks and vendors – need to step away from old proprietary solutions which may never be agile enough to allow clients to adopt these new offerings. But, as Towers says, “that’s why we’re working with treasurers, with fintechs and other FIs, making sure these solutions work for everyone in the best possible way”.</p>

<p><em>With technology evolving at a rapid pace, businesses and treasurers need to know how best to keep up. The fourth edition of the Journeys to Treasury report explores exactly that.</em></p>
<p>Keeping pace with change is not easy so when it comes to future-proofing treasury, Jan Dirk van Beusekom, Head of Strategic Engagement Cash Management and Trade Solutions at BNP Paribas, believes that it’s essential to find the right partners.</p>
<p>This is the spirit in which BNP Paribas, PwC, SAP and the European Association of Corporate Treasurers (EACT), come together to create the fourth edition of Journeys to Treasury. This online report aims to deliver “rich insights on the trends, challenges and priorities that are shaping best practices in treasury both today and in the future”.</p>
<p>As the result of discussions between the partners on the topics currently most relevant to treasurers, he feels that it delivers a genuine reflection of the needs of today’s treasury practitioner.</p>
<p>The four main sections of this year’s edition are: payments and collections, FX and risk management, technology enablers and the future treasury. Van Beusekom dives straight in.</p>
<p>“It all starts with good cash flow forecasting and knowing your exposures,” he says, outlining the main challenges when automating the FX workforce. Of course, once treasury knows its exposures, it can begin to hedge them. For many corporates this can be a very manual process, “so it’s about the accuracy of the data and then making sure that you can do the right hedge to reduce your FX exposure,” he explains.</p>
<p>The solutions to this and other pressing treasury challenges are very much in the remit of the latest ‘Journeys to Treasury report’. Indeed, Mahesh Kini, Head of Cash Management Asia Pacific at BNP Paribas, notes that for Asia Pacific (APAC), there are two sections that should particularly appeal to treasurers:</p>
<p>Payments and collections – as one of the fastest changing and developing systems in APAC – and FX management, where the wide range of currencies in the region make it one of the most important parts of a treasurer’s role here.</p>
<p>For APAC treasuries, Kini identifies three main drivers for digitisation of payments:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The regulators: “Eight out of 12 regulators in Asia are driving real-time payments,” he says, noting too that many are making it mandatory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A proliferation and emergence of payment service providers (PSPs): PSPs and the systems provided by the central banks are providing a ‘growth environment’ for alternate payment channels in APAC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consumer behaviour: The adaptability of new technology, such as mobile phones, is driving consumers to adopt new technology and new payments models. “I think that’s the most important one,” comments Kini.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Underscoring several reasons why the Journeys to Treasury report is so integral for treasurers, Kini sees it as a truly global publication, covering all regions. It’s also a neutral report, the broad spread of partners involved in its production ensuring no bias. Furthermore, it represents views from all areas of the finance industry, not just banks but also accounting and technology firms.</p>
<p id=""video"">In keeping with this view, van Beusekom urges treasurers to work with organisations that encourage collaboration, such as national associations of corporate treasurers. His most essential piece of advice though, given the speed of technological evolution, is to hire a tech-savvy payments specialist. After all, he adds, “it’s all about collaboration”, a positive notion upon which Journeys to Treasury is founded upon.</p>

<p><em>Treasury may once have been viewed as an ivory tower within the organisation. But today, it’s more important than ever for the treasury to be integrated closely with the rest of the business – both by communicating effectively with other teams, and by harnessing technology to build closer connections.</em></p>
<p>Treasury was once characterised as an ‘ivory tower’ within the organisation, with the treasurer seen as relatively separate from other departments. But, in recent years the role of the treasurer has evolved considerably to become more connected with the rest of the business.</p>
<p>A report published last year by the ACT, The Business of Treasury, found that 87% of respondents saw treasury as a strategic business partner in their organisations. Meanwhile, PwC’s 2019 Global Treasury Benchmarking Survey identified business partnering capabilities as one of the top three characteristics “most sought after in treasurers and their teams, beyond functional Treasury expertise.”</p>
<p>Connecting effectively with other departments within the business is essential to a modern treasury. But in practice, a successful integration will have many different components, from sharing knowledge and moving roles between different functions to using technology to achieve a deeper connection.</p>
<h4 id=""problem-solvers"">Problem solvers</h4>
<p>First and foremost, good communication is essential when it comes to effective integration with the rest of the business. Marianna Polykrati, Group Treasurer of Greek food group Chipita, explains that in Greece, treasury has become much more integrated with the business in recent years, especially after capital control restrictions were imposed – not least because across the organisation, all departments are increasingly focusing on the importance of cash generation and improving working capital.</p>
<p>“This has made us collaborate with the organisation more than in the past,” she says. “In particular, we have integrated a lot with the business units within areas such as sales and procurement in order to assist with relationships with suppliers, and to facilitate clients in their own financing needs. In practice this means that we meet more frequently with all the business departments – and whenever they need assistance, they call the treasury and ask if we can help with a particular client or supplier. I would say that we have taken a role of a problem solver, facilitating cash flow needs wherever applicable.”</p>
<h4 id=""sharing-knowledge"">Sharing knowledge</h4>
<p>Likewise, sharing knowledge is an effective way that treasury can work more closely with the rest of the business.</p>
<p>While the role of the treasurer is multifaceted, and can vary considerably between organisations, the main competence of the treasury specialist can be roughly defined as “quantifying financial risks and determining the time value and availability of cash flows,” says Sander van Tol, Partner at independent treasury, risk and finance consultancy Zanders. He adds that the specific knowledge around those two areas can – and should – be used in an integrated way towards the business.</p>
<p>“There are numerous examples of where the treasurer’s specific knowledge is required and can add value to business processes,” he adds. “Examples of the business integration are working capital management, credit risk management, insurance and procurement. With regard to the latter, treasury is often asked to support procurement around purchasing commodities and energy, as well as managing the related financial risks from this process.”</p>
<p>Peter Cunningham, EMEA Head of Consumer &amp; Healthcare Sector, Treasury and Trade Solutions at Citi, notes that areas such as working capital and supply chain finance provide a clear example of how treasury can engage with the rest of the business, demonstrating “a natural relationship that’s evolved between treasury and some of these other internal verticals within the company.”</p>
<h4 id=""reviewing-roles"">Reviewing roles</h4>
<p>Another area of exploration is how roles within the treasury team can be organised to improve integration with the rest of the business. Cunningham says that in the past, treasurers may have focused on more traditional roles and responsibilities, such as ensuring an optimal funding model and mitigating risk. But more recently, he says some treasuries are adding new roles within the treasury team, with the specific goal of engaging more effectively with the rest of the business.</p>
<p>Van Tol says that from a human resources point of view there are a number of different approaches that treasuries may adopt. “Many traditional treasuries see the function as a specialised and standalone function for a high level of specific knowledge is required,” he explains. “These treasuries are not fully integrated in the business and prefer to hire (seasoned) specialist treasury professionals when there is a vacancy in the treasury department.”</p>


<blockquote><p>If treasury sees the relationship with business only as a mere principal-agent relationship, no real value is unlocked and there is not integration. The relationship should be more seen as equal business partners in which both partners (treasury and business) can benefit from the integration.</p></blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">Sander van Tol, Partner, Zanders</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>In other organisations, van Tol says a more integrated approach may be adopted. “Specific treasury knowledge and competences are required to get a better view of the broader finance function,” he says. “In these organisations, we see that there are job rotation schemes in place where treasury specialists transition into business roles, and finance/business managers take treasury roles.” He adds that in corporations where treasury is part of the finance function’s job rotation program or management development programme, “we tend to see a better fit between treasury and business.”</p>
<h4 id=""technology-and-integration"">Technology and integration</h4>
<p>Aside from soft skills and human resources considerations, the treasury’s integration with the rest of the business also has a technology component. Van Tol noes that treasurers are used to working with a “relatively high number of different specialised technology solutions”, including treasury management systems, electronic dealing platforms, payment systems and bank connectivity solutions, as well as best of breed applications for areas such as cash flow forecasting, hedge accounting and risk management. However, as van Tol points out, “many of these applications are very focused on the key treasury function, and the interface to the broader finance function is often the weakest link.”</p>
<p>Consequently, he argues it would be beneficial for treasury’s integration with the business if this link was strengthened by a better interface between different applications. “A good example of full integration from a technology perspective are those companies who have implemented a data warehouse/data lake, which is used as the single source of truth for both treasury and the business,” he says.</p>
<p>That said, van Tol notes, “From an IT function’s perspective, we sometimes still come across this treasury vs the rest of the business mentality.” He adds that this is due to the very specific functional (and sometimes also technical and security) requirements defined by treasury. “For IT departments, the treasury function is a very specific and demanding internal client,” he says. “They use many different systems and have a limited number of users.”</p>
<p>Polykrati says that as well as working more closely with areas like procurement and sales, the company’s treasury is also more integrated with IT, not least due to the rising threat posed by cybercrime. “They are always afraid of a breach made via phishing mails – which have significantly increased during recent years – so we work closely with IT, exchanging news and real cases to improve the group’s awareness,” she explains. That said, there is still room for improvement – and in the future, Polykrati says she hopes to adopt a treasury management system so the treasury can have a more automated system in place.</p>
<h4 id=""managing-and-forecasting-cash-flows"">Managing and forecasting cash flows</h4>
<p>Cash forecasting is one area where close collaboration with the rest of the business is particularly important. In order to forecast effectively, treasurers will typically need to obtain information from a variety of sources, such as AP and local business units. However, this may be less than smooth if the people expected to provide information lack a clear understanding of what is needed or why the forecast is important.</p>
<p>Effective communication with the relevant departments is essential if treasurers are to obtain accurate information and therefore build an accurate forecast. Technology also has a role to play in streamlining this process. Nick Armstrong, CEO of Identitii, says that improvements to straight-through processing (STP) and additional functionalities arising from new and existing technologies, mean that “treasurers are able to better forecast cash positions and therefore better support other parts of the business as they play their roles.”</p>
<p>George Dessing, Executive Vice President Treasury &amp; Risk at Wolters Kluwer, likewise notes that cash flow management is a complex process – “and increasingly so within the dynamic and continuously changing international environment that we deal with at Wolters Kluwer.” He says that implementing one of the company’s products, CCH Tagetik, “will help us to receive information from our businesses in a more structured and efficient way”, with automated updates and a central repository showing the impact of business changes on the company’s cash flow plans.</p>
<h4 id=""blind-spots"">Blind spots</h4>
<p>That’s not to say that the integration between treasury and the rest of the business is invariably seamless. For example, Michael Bosacco, Treasury Advisory Executive in Global Transaction Services at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, says that treasury has always been well integrated with certain disciplines, such as tax, legal accounting and, more recently, technology. He notes that these teams “all have logical dependencies and typically are united in their efforts to ensure a company’s capital and operations are optimized and the overarching strategy is successfully executed.”</p>
<p>However, Bosacco also notes that beyond these core corporate disciplines, it is “uncommon” to find treasury deeply rooted within the business units it supports. “As a result, there’s a tendency for blind spots to exist,” he says.</p>
<p>What do these blind spots look like in practice? Bosacco explains that in most companies the corporate functions report into the CFO, whereas business unit presidents report to the COO (if one exists) or the CEO, alongside the CFO. “This structure breeds treasury (or other corporate function) blind spots, since the CFO typically cannot effectively faceoff operationally from a treasury standpoint to offer integration opportunities between the businesses and treasury,” says Bosacco. “For example, if a company has three major business units, each unit will not have its own treasury function, but the units will have a dedicated finance team.”</p>
<p>Where integration is concerned, Bosacco says blind spots can arise both because business unit finance considers treasury to be the group that takes all the cash, and because treasury considers the business unit finance to be the group that makes decisions on how/when to collect from customers and pay vendors.</p>
<p>“Needless to say, the two (cash and receive/pay) converge when considering basic balance sheet management,” says Bosacco. “While CFOs and business unit presidents know this, they are rarely familiar with the operational requirements, products or services that can create the convergence” – a situation that Bosacco identifies as another blind spot. “This exists because the silo of corporate functions continues to run alongside the silo of business functions, and so integration fails,” he adds.</p>
<h4 id=""eliminating-blind-spots-with-technology"">Eliminating blind spots with technology</h4>
<p>Bosacco says that technology “helps break barriers by improving the visibility and awareness of data and workflows across the business and enterprise-wide, breeding openness”, noting that this is the opposite of a blind spot. He adds that “tech savvy treasuries” are beginning to use digital tools to achieve a number of goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Eliminating blind spots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rooting treasury into the business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Driving convergence across the enterprise.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>According to Bosacco, digital adoption – in other words, consuming data and employing technology to support near-time decision making – “provides a reusable pathway for Treasury to connect with the rest of the business. For example, business analysis generated from technology tools used to unlock data from across the enterprise can serve as the foundation to support strategic insights for both the business and company-wide.”</p>
<h4 id=""bringing-it-all-together"">Bringing it all together</h4>
<p>In conclusion, there’s much to be gained by building closer connections between treasury and the rest of the business – and there are many ways in which companies can achieve this. Key to this is approaching the task with the right mindset. As van Tol comments, “If treasury sees the relationship with business only as a mere principal-agent relationship, no real value is unlocked and there is not integration. The relationship should be more seen as equal business partners in which both partners (treasury and business) can benefit from the integration.”</p>

<h5>George Dessing, Executive Vice President Treasury &amp; Risk</h5>
<p>Treasury is certainly an integrated function for Wolters Kluwer, which provides professional information, software solutions and services for a number of sectors, including health, tax and accounting, risk and compliance, and legal and regulatory.</p>
<p>“Treasury is viewed as a holistic role within Wolters Kluwer,” says George Dessing, whose responsibilities include global treasury, risk management, (non-IT) business continuity and real estate. He explains that as well as managing traditional financial risks, the treasury function has evolved over the last decade to support the business with its operational risks “by supporting and servicing via risk management and real estate teams with property and business interruption risks.”</p>
<h5>Benefits of collaboration</h5>
<p>According to Dessing, collaboration between treasury and the rest of the business helps the entire company to be “safer, more streamlined and more efficient”, as well as identifying opportunities that drive operational and financial agility. “Treasury can do this in three ways: be the knowledge centre; be the enabler for cost saving; be the arranger for alignment of the finance terms and conditions,” he says. “Treasury needs to be a strategic partner working closely with business to identify how to make customer experience as simple as possible, yet make sure that it is done in a secure way.”</p>
<p>Dessing says that under the multi-disciplinary approach used to support the company’s 2019-2021 strategy, ‘accelerating our value’, “we look at how treasury processes, practices and technology fit in with the rest of the business and uncover ways of keeping the conversation and the data flow running smoothly.” By being more connected, he says treasury can anticipate some of the challenges that might be faced by the business and when possible address them, “before items become a fire drill.”</p>
<h5>Integration in practice</h5>
<p>Dessing highlights three key areas where treasury is closely integrated with the rest of the business:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Global liquidity arranger.</strong> Dessing says: “The most important role of treasury is to ensure that the group has ample headroom and liquidity available for expanding our presence in leading, high growth parts of the business and broaden our footprint where we have achieved market leadership and enter new geographies where we see the best potential for growth.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Internal bank.</strong> “We act as an in-house bank for short-term cash needs and provide intercompany loans for the mid to long-term where the cash needs are more structural,” notes Dessing. “For most intercompany transfers we have a current account netting system in place that greatly reduced handling and bank fees by avoiding having to do real cash payments.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Financial treasury risk manager.</strong> As Dessing explains, “The group’s activities are exposed to a variety of financial risks, including market, liquidity, and credit risk. Financial risk identification and management is carried out by the central treasury department, whereby the treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and guidelines (treasury policy).”</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>There is much debate around the threats that banks are facing with the advent of fintech and the disruption this will cause to their businesses.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the aftermath of the global financial crisis damaged the reputation of the banking world and led to a period of introspection, coupled with increased regulatory resilience measures. As a result, banks must hold more capital to cover the perceived risks of their activities as a requirement.</p>
<p>In the meantime, fintechs were able to exploit the weaknesses in the banking system with the promise that new technologies would transform the provision of banking services, whether or not the banks were ready to play.</p>
<p>In the last few years, banks have repositioned themselves, with some deciding to focus activity on specific countries, product areas, or the servicing of particular customer segments. Much of this has affected their provision of services to the SME market rather than the major and global corporate companies. Banks have also begun to embrace the world of fintech by adopting the new technologies, and joining transformation programmes to change some of the paper driven and commoditised services into digitised and streamlined processes.</p>
<p>However, there is much evidence to show that fintechs and other companies that provide complimentary services to banks, or hold and manage mass amounts of data, are nibbling around the edges of what was once the preserve of the banks. For example, foreign exchange services, payments, and cash management are becoming readily available through non-bank service providers. Open banking and the increased availability of real-time data have created further opportunities and competition, and with treasurers being more attuned to the efficiency gains that can be achieved through these new service providers, further growth is expected.</p>
<p>While the non-bank sector can claim to be more flexible and innovative, they do not have the history and long-standing relationships that banks and corporate companies maintain. Banks have more experience and knowledge of the treasury support required by corporates and so remain their trusted partner, despite not being able to deliver services as efficiently as some of the new players.</p>
<p>Banks cannot rest on their laurels. As fintechs gain more experience and traction, there are now more receptive treasurers who are open to learning about their advancements and offerings. In the meantime, banks are reacting through increased collaboration with the fintech world, and, for some banking services, maintain the risk appetite and balance sheet that cannot be matched by a fintech or non-bank player.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is my view that while the banks will not have a future monopoly on treasury services, they will retain a dominant position in the servicing of the major corporate sector.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>If one were to cast their mind back ten years ago, from a corporate treasurer’s perspective, all financial services required to effect cash and risk management were largely enabled through the offerings of their organisation’s banking partners. For a long time, banks enjoyed a dominating monopoly on treasury services offered to corporates. This was before the financial crisis. When it came time for the surviving banks to dust themselves off and pick up the pieces, their focus was on getting their core operations back up and running, and attention to technological progress and advancement was relegated to the back of the queue.</p>
<p>It was at that point that the mantle of innovation in IT and financial services was taken up by financial technology firms (fintechs) who were able to develop new products with the pace and agility that banks were unable to replicate. It was the fintechs who first championed and encouraged the use of application programming interfaces (API) in banking and finance.</p>
<p>An API is a set of functions, communication protocols, and procedures that enable the communication between two applications or systems and facilitate the exchange of data rapidly and at a reduced cost allowing for increased operational efficiencies. These relatively new advances in technology, coupled with recent changes in banking regulations, have altered the industry landscape quite significantly and in favour of the fintechs who, up until recently, weren’t able to compete effectively with the banks without the equivalent means of product and services distribution.</p>
<p>In March 2015, HM Treasury announced in its Budget Report that the UK government was keen to drive increased competition in the banking market to enable banks, alternative providers of financial services, and fintechs to be able to compete on even terms in winning new and retaining existing customers.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today and the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) throughout the EU as well as in the UK via the Competition and Markets Authority mandated roll out of the Open Banking Standards has lowered the drawbridge on customer data held by the banks and enabled the fintechs and other enterprising third parties to harness APIs that could potentially, in the very near future, benefit treasurers immensely.</p>
<p>APIs work at much faster speeds than batch processing or host-to-host bank connections, and as a result a corporate can obtain real-time views of their cash. They could utilise an API to go out to all their banking partners, collecting the latest view of their transactions and balances, thereby enhancing their cash management and reporting abilities, all from one platform developed by a fintech. This is instead of needing to go through individual banking portals or waiting for prior day or intraday statements to be pulled in.</p>
<p>Instant payment capabilities have also come about through the use of APIs offered by fintechs with benefits, including instant feedback on payment status and notifications of successful submission or errors. These are just a few examples of the possibilities that fintechs are developing, leveraging the open playing field.</p>
<p>Banks have not ignored this fact and have started building out their data strategy to include collaborations with fintechs and increasingly leverage APIs to not lose market share or the customer experience. But one thing is for certain: the current situation is vastly different and large banks may not hold the upper hand in the treasury services arena for too much longer unless they can begin to evolve as quickly as their more agile fintech competition.</p>

<p><em>The notion that corporates may one day do all their banking with tech groups seems entirely possible. It’s forcing an urgent revaluation between banks and their corporate clients of where the true value in their relationship rests. From the outside, corporate banking looks as vulnerable of falling victim to the internet as its retail cousin; look a bit closer and banks still have important advantages.</em></p>
<p>Two years ago Omnicom Group, the global marketing and communications company, introduced a centralised payments function within its US and European treasury divisions. It swapped a laborious, decentralised system involving processing payments through 500 separate accounts in the two regions, for non-bank technology from fintech company Pelican.</p>
<p>The new system gathers daily payment data from every Omnicom entity and aggregates those payments into a single file that is then processed through one bank account. “Banks are trying to do something similar but they’re not quite there yet,” says Maeve Robinson, Assistant Treasurer at Omnicom who spoke to multiple software providers before choosing Pelican. “The centralised disbursement system is more efficient and allows us to focus on strategic activities like cash flow forecasting, managing our debt and investment maturities, interest rate risk management, and ultimately promote shareholder value.”</p>
<p>Banks have been losing sections of their business to tech companies for a while, as sophisticated treasury teams switch to new software to improve their cost base and efficiencies. But the trend of fintechs picking off key parts of banks’ value chain to offer specific services is gathering apace. The churn of new applications and software means the outsourcing or unbundling of treasury services to fintech groups is constantly encroaching on banks’ traditional and profitable corporate offering, spanning everything from payments to foreign exchange and small company lending.</p>
<p>It is also happening much faster than banks, saddled with legacy technology and struggling to change the pipes while the water is still running, can adapt or compete. The notion that corporates may one day do all their banking with tech groups, particularly the big ones like Google or Amazon, seems entirely possible. It’s forcing an urgent revaluation between banks and their corporate clients of where the true value in their relationship rests. From the outside, corporate banking looks as vulnerable to falling victim to the internet as its retail cousin; look a bit closer and banks still have important advantages.</p>
<h3 id=""unbundling-rolls-on"">Unbundling rolls on</h3>
<p>The unbundling trend is everywhere. SWIFT’s payment system offering corporates direct access to its platform to avoid transacting through multiple banks is the most obvious example. “We’ve just started using SWIFT because we needed technology that was independent from banks to meet our growing number of transactions and desire for independence,” says Tim de Knegt, Manager, Strategic Finance and Treasury at the Port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands. The raft of new know your customer (KYC) service providers which have sprung up offering the Holy Grail of standardised, automated KYC in contrast to onboarding with individual banks is another.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>In one trend, tech companies are now introducing multi-bank portals for a much broader range of organisations, changing the way they can interact with banks as big corporate treasury already has. Non-banks like Kyriba and Finestra are introducing software that offers multi-bank portal interfaces directly, allowing more companies to carry out transfers, access information, compare prices and execute trades through their platform across multiple banks. “It’s an important trend that is making it much more transparent for the treasuer,” says Thomas Olsen, a partner in Bain &amp; Company’s Singapore office.</p>
<h3 id=""bank-of-amazon"">Bank of Amazon</h3>
<p>Technology companies are also bypassing banks to interact directly with corporates to cause disintermediation. This is most notable around supply chain finance and working capital solutions offered by cloud-based specialists like PrimeRevenue or Tradeshift. Similarly, Amazon and Alibaba now offer supply chain finance to the vast ecosystem of merchants selling through their sites. “This is the kind of financing down the supply chain that banks would have done in the past,” says Olsen.</p>
<p>Tech giants’ access to buyers and sellers’ data fuels their ability to offer working capital solutions. Amazon’s data gathering on the retail and consumer goods companies using its site spans things like information on their suppliers to how frequently they sell to large corporations; trade flows and details of destination and origination markets. Admittedly, it’s only one area of data and doesn’t reveal a holistic picture of a companies’ treasury policies around issues like foreign exchange hedging or overall cashflows, but it is more than enough to build new products and solutions around.</p>
<p>Indeed, it’s not just corporates outsourcing to tech companies. Banks themselves are throwing in the towel and outsourcing to fintechs, particularly around payment processes. Witness Commerzbank recently outsourcing all of its payments processing in the single euro payments area (SEPA) to French tech group equensWorldline. The ten-year contract will see equensWorldline take over all SEPA instant, multi-currency, and domestic payments – equating to 4bn transactions per year – on behalf of the bank, migrating legacy inhouse architecture to the equensWordline platform.</p>
<p>The loss of profitable services means less fees for banks and could result in banks charging more for large financings. An ongoing transaction banking and working capital relationship allows banks to build a credit profile when it comes to raising debt for new services and solutions. If companies only come to banks for bigger financing solutions, it will cost more.</p>
<h3 id=""client-is-king"">Client is king</h3>
<p>But tech companies’ encroachment on banks’ corporate business offering doesn’t extend into one important area – yet: the valuable relationship banks have with their corporate clients. Whether treasury divisions are investing in their own software solutions, outsourcing to third parties or using a third-party service through their bank, banks are still banking their clients. “Technology companies are playing a role in the corporate banking value chain, but corporates are unlikely to switch their core relationship to tech companies,” says Olsen.</p>
<p>One reason is because fintechs are not actually trying to compete with banks on everything because much of what banks do isn’t their area of expertise. This could involve providing a large credit facility, require a banking licence, or the ability to implement transactions in a regulatory environment. Platforms will face increasing regulation the more they venture into banks territory and although fintechs are cash rich, it remains to be seen whether they have the appetite to take on the costs associated with compliance. “A large corporate bank does many things, much of which a technology company wouldn’t want to do,” says Olsen.</p>
<h3 id=""data-danger"">Data danger</h3>
<p>And corporate treasury is similarly reticent to embrace tech firms as their new bankers. It all comes down to trust. Companies are wary of how tech companies are already storing and using their data, nor do they trust them to manage their deposits or keep their assets safe. “I wouldn’t give a tech company a penny of our deposits because I don’t want to do anything that would put our assets at risk,” says Omnicom’s Robinson. “The Federal Reserve sits behind US banks; tech companies don’t have that because they are not banks.” She adds that choosing a third-party provider to implement the company’s new centralised disbursement technology involved a leap of faith. Two years on, and she would still rather the technology sat behind her banks’ firewall. “I would be more comfortable with banks’ level of security, systems and data centres, but they can’t do it right now,” she says. It’s a mistrust evident in her insistence that the daily payment data comes back in-house, enabling a “last look” before treasury sends it to the bank for processing – rather than Pelican mail the file direct, host to host.</p>
<p>Nor do treasurers like the thought of being sold services off the back of data gathered by tech companies. “I know that a bank will not use my data to predict what type of services they can sell to me,” says de Knegt, who explains that his concern that tech companies might use the Port’s data in this way is already manifesting in treasury strategy. “We are considering to what extent we should use technology in our financial processes from tech firms because the information we give them is much more valuable than the service their technology performs for us.”</p>
<h3 id=""advisory-wins"">Advisory wins</h3>
<p>Indeed, he wants his banks to do much more to leverage the information they hold and their sector expertise, to offer more, higher value services. Alerts to risk in the Port’s complex supply chain that stretches to over 20,000 companies, is a key area in which he’d like some help. “We will invest more than €2bn in the port area over the next five years and if a small customer or supplier is in financial trouble it could mean the difference between a finished project, or a delay of several years.” He welcomes signs that some of his relationship banks are beginning to adapt and offer client analysis, like ING’s data company Suburbia.</p>
<p>The call on banks to make more of their corporate relationships, and translate their customer knowledge into new services, opportunities and profit, is coming loudest from within the banking community, especially while fintech still lacks the institutional history and access to flows needed to inform the advisory expertise that corporates say they value most. “The relationship is wasted unless banks leverage their knowledge of the client and turn it into a value proposition,” says Citi’s EMEA Treasury Solutions Head, Ebru Pakcan. It’s a process that should see banks get their hands dirty with new technologies, experimenting with clients around AI and data science, and worrying less about the immediate application of technologies. “Banks need to be able to pick up a piece of technology and understand how it works and what it does,” she says.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>She draws on Citi’s adoption of blockchain, where the hype often 
overshadows the realistic application, as an example of the approach in 
action. Rather than exploring ways to make payments on blockchain 
itself, Citi is looking at how its clients which are adopting blockchain
 can connect to traditional payments and financial services within the 
bank. “We have concentrated on how the bank can connect to the 
blockchain ledger of a corporate client and receive instructions and 
send information. We currently have one live client and are talking to 
others. It comes down to asking what problem are we trying to solve for 
our clients and what new services are needed?”</p>
<p>It also requires looking at what a business will look like in five 
years’ time, she says. Banks need to examine how companies’ changing 
business models will require different technology. For example, 
application programme interfaces (APIs) may not make much sense for a 
traditional treasury, but if a business switches from a distribution 
model to selling direct to consumers and selling more on-line, the real 
time benefit of API connectivity comes into play.</p>
<p>In another development that could work in banks’ favour, some 
fintech’s are struggling to sell their services direct to corporates, 
especially those plying data information technology to improve cash 
optimisation. It means these firms are increasingly coming to banks to 
help them break into corporate treasury. Citi’s recent collaboration 
with US-based fintech HighRadius illustrates the point, says Pakcan. 
“Many of these tech companies don’t require banking partners and they 
could go direct to the corporate. However, they need that introduction 
and access to the flows, and partnering with us makes integration 
smoother for the corporate,” she says. Viewed through this lens, the new
 financial services landscape shifts from competition to cooperation in a
 win-win for tech companies, banks and corporate treasury.</p>
<p>Unbundling may also slow down. Of course, technology erodes many 
inefficiencies, but the more third parties a corporate works with, the 
more unwieldly and potentially costly the proposition; unbundling also 
breaks with the two-decade trend in rationalising corporate treasury and
 one-stop shopping with large banks. “There is a fine balance in terms 
of how many third parties you want to partner with, ensuring that the 
benefits of these relationships don’t suddenly become costly and 
inefficient,” argues Pakcan who notes that companies expanding into 
emerging markets particularly benefit from a comprehensive single 
solution because working with individual providers is difficult.</p>
<p>Treasury is using technology to access banks’ services more 
efficiently, and new software is allowing corporates to change the way 
they interact with their banks. Yet ask most companies if they’ll start 
banking with a fintech and the answer is no: they depend on banks to 
keep their money safe in different pockets of the world and depend on 
technology providers for the software and applications they provide. 
“The difference between banks and IT companies is black and white,” 
concludes Robinson.</p>

<p><em>New regulation in Europe and the UK has the potential to transform the face of financial services. Treasury Today finds out what the future might look like under PSD2 and open banking and what it all means for treasurers.</em></p>
<p> “A decade from now the banking environment will be unrecognisable,” says Jonathan Turner, Partner, Financial Services at PwC, when asked what impact open banking will have on Europe’s financial sector.</p>
<p>This is because the new rules, brought in by the European Union’s Payment Service Directive 2 (PSD2) and the UK Competition and Markets Authority’s (CMA) Open Banking initiative, is forcing banks to open up their IT infrastructures through application programme interfaces (APIs) to a host of regulated third parties – including their competitors. This may give rise to new business models and offer banks the opportunity to connect with the wider financial ecosystem and offer a host of innovative services to their clients.</p>
<p>Turner illustrates this point using the analogy of smart TVs. “When internet-enabled TVs first launched, some manufacturers allowed only one or two third parties to access them and provide services such as movie streaming,” he says. “In many cases, these services eventually stopped working and many users were left with TVs that offered limited internet-enabled services.”</p>
<p>However, as Turner explains, others allowed third parties to build and offer services through open APIs. Owners of these TVs were therefore able to access a variety of constantly evolving online services. Today, this is what most TV manufacturers offer.</p>
<p>“If you think about this in the context of banks, then I foresee there being some banks that attempt to continue operating much in the same way they have today,” says Turner. “These will focus on innovating in-house and using their balance sheets to consume any competition.”</p>
<p>“Then there will be those banks that actively encourage third parties to interact with their services through open APIs. It will be the latter that capture the imagination of customers and win the day, I believe.”</p>
<h3 id=""open-banking-in-brief"">Open banking in brief</h3>
<p>Before exploring the impact that open banking will have on financial services, it is worth looking at what is behind the two key regulations driving it: PSD2 and the CMA’s Open Banking initiative.</p>
<p>In 2015, the European Commission (EC) announced PSD2 to replace the original Payment Service Directive (PSD). Broadly speaking, PSD2 is intended to reflect the changes that have occurred in the payments industry because of digitisation. The aim is to make the European payments market more integrated, competitive, fair, cheap and efficient. PSD2 also sets out to improve security standards by regulating third-party financial service providers, known as account information service providers (AISPs) and payment initiation service providers (PISPs).</p>
<p>To achieve this, PSD2 has brought in a host of new rules that banks must comply with. The most impactful of these is the Access to Account rule, whereby customers can allow third-party AISPs and PISPs to access account data from their bank or banks through open APIs. The ASIPs and PISPs can then provide customers with a range of new services.</p>
<p>Launched in 2016 following a study of the retail banking landscape in the UK, the UK CMA’s Open Banking initiative is similar. The regulation mandates the UK’s nine largest current account providers to make customer data available to third parties. These third parties, with customer consent, can access this data to offer many different services including payment initiation and account aggregation payments. As in PSD2, this information will be shared through APIs.</p>
<h3 id=""state-of-play"">State of play</h3>
<p>With PSD2 going live in January this year, one of the most contentious issues has been the time taken to finalise and announce the regulatory technical standards (RTS). The RTS provides the rules that outline how banks should share account information, and how third parties can initiate payments under PSD2. These standards were eventually announced in late November 2017, with banks needing to comply by September 2019. In contrast, the standards for the UK’s open banking were confirmed early on.</p>
<p>This delay has frustrated fintechs that have applied to become AISPs or PISPs. “Because it has taken so long for the technical standards to be published, the banks have rightly waited to invest significant sums into their first PSD2 offering,” says James Higgins, Product Director at AccessPay. “This is frustrating for us at AccessPay as we have recently requested to become an AISP. We don’t know what form the information we are requesting will be delivered in, making it hard to develop solutions for our customers.”</p>
<p>Higgins also believes that PSD2 could have been more closely aligned with the developments in the EU’s payments infrastructure. He uses the development of Australia’s New Payments Platform (NPP) as an example of how it could have been done differently. “The NPP contains APIs that will allow a host of third parties to build overlay services using the rich data carried over the payment rails,” he says. “The overall objective is like that of PSD2 – to drive innovation – yet it seems to be happening in a more aligned way, whereas in the EU it is all happening in silos.”</p>
<p>The banks have likewise expressed their frustration about the delay in announcing the RTS standards. There is also some concern about the speed at which PSD2 is being implemented by EU countries into their law, with some countries already announcing that they will miss the deadline. “The goal is standardisation across Europe, but banks, in general, are still struggling to find the most optimal business models for themselves, the third-party providers and most importantly their customers,” says Gunnar Berger, Head of Open Banking at Nordea.</p>
<p>What this means is that come 13th January 2018, the world will not have changed and we will not suddenly be able to access a host of new and exciting financial services, says Marcus Hughes, Director of Business Development, Bottomline Technologies. “In theory, PSD2 will be live, but in practice, the changes that will come with it will not be felt by the end-users of financial services until later,” he says.</p>


<blockquote>Some institutions are struggling with the burden of regulation. These banks see PSD2 as just one more thing they need to do.</blockquote>

<p>One of the most interesting aspects of open banking is the banking
community’s response to it. On the one hand, open banking poses a threat
to incumbent banks and may see them lose parts of the customer
relationships and, in some cases, revenue streams. On the other hand, it
also provides banks with an opportunity to boost the products and
services that they offer customers, potentially driving customer loyalty
and creating new revenue streams.</p>
<p>A 2016 survey by Strategy&amp; found that for the most part, banks in
Europe were on the defensive when it came to PSD2 and open banking,
with mostly negative perceptions of the new rules. Indeed, the study
found that many saw PSD2 as just an exercise in compliance and a driver
of cost, rather than an opportunity. Fast-forward a year and PwC’s
Turner believes that this remains the case for a handful of banks. “Some
institutions are struggling with the burden of regulation,” he says.
“These banks see PSD2 as just one more thing they need to do.”</p>
<p>Turner adds that it can be quite easy to tell which banks think that
PSD2 is a burden or an opportunity by hearing about the main
responsibilities of their Heads of Open Banking. “Some Heads of Open
Banking focus solely on compliance,” he says. “Others are focused on
vision and creating the bank of the future.”</p>
<p>Despite the reservations banks may have about open banking, many are
experimenting in this area. The Strategy&amp; survey found that 44% of
banks planned to provide an open bank offering in the next five years.
Moreover, 64% said they intended to integrate foreign products or
functionalities into own digital offering. Forty-four percent also said
they are planning to integrate their own products or functionalities
into foreign ecosystems.</p>

<h3 id=""the-bullish-banks-view"">The bullish bank’s view</h3>
<p>Bullish about the open banking phenomenon, Nordea is keen to explore
how it can leverage open APIs and work with fintechs to offer new
services to its clients. “Nordea sees PSD2 and open banking as an
opportunity to offer better services for our customers and to become
more agile by partnering up,” says Gunnar Berger, Head of Open Banking
at Nordea. “By sharing the development load, we can bring innovative
services to market faster. I believe many banks will follow the same
approach and work to develop and leverage partnerships with future
service providers. Those who lag behind in this area are missing a big
opportunity.”</p>
<p>Despite this positive outlook, Nordea is cognisant that change will
not happen overnight. “There is still a lot of work we have to continue
with within the bank,” says Berger. “We must continue to update our core
system. Equally important is changing the culture in the bank to
improve how we work with external partners.”</p>
<p>Overall though, Berger is excited about the future. “PSD2, along with
changing customer behaviour and general technological developments,
will have a big impact on the banking industry across Europe, leading to
increased competition,” he says. “We expect that PSD2 will boost
innovation and the creation of new services by, or in collaboration
with, third parties. This will lead to the emergence of a new payments
ecosystem. After a time of maturation, we believe that corporate
customers who experience the benefits of open banking will start to
demand APIs and openness from their banking partners elsewhere in the
world.”</p>

<h3 id=""a-brave-new-world-for-treasury"">A brave new world for treasury?</h3>
<p>PSD2 and open banking will clearly have a big impact on banks, but
what impact will corporate treasurers, as the end users of financial
services, see? At this stage, it is hard to say. For one thing, user
cases are still developing, or have not yet been thought of. At the same
time, the retail space is largely dominating the innovation agenda.</p>
<p>There are signs of what corporates can expect out there in the
market, however. One area where treasury will most certainly see an
early benefit is through aggregated account visibility. HSBC, for
example, recently announced that it would enable UK customers to view
their account balances from 21 different banking providers through their
online banking platform.</p>
<p>Whilst this is aimed chiefly at retail customers, Bottomline’s Hughes
says that one of the most exciting aspects of open banking is that it
brings efficient multi-banking to SMEs and middle market corporates.
“Currently, only corporates on SWIFT can benefit from efficient
multi-banking,” he says. “Open banking and the use of APIs will bring
the price of this down, meaning that smaller companies will be able to
see up-to-date balances across their accounts in real-time and manage
these through one portal.” Hughes is also excited about what can be
built on top of this foundation. “On top of multi-banking, solution
providers can add sweeping, liquidity management, forecasting and the
other value-add applications at a low price point to middle market
corporates and SME,” he says.</p>
<p>PwC’s Turner adds that banks might even begin to offer SMEs and
middle market corporates non-financial related products because of open
banking. “There is no reason a bank could not offer CRM systems through
its banking portal,” he says. “In theory, it could even offer these
companies a completely outsourced finance function, which is pretty
revolutionary.”</p>
<h3 id=""apis-lessons-from-elsewhere"">APIs: lessons from elsewhere</h3>
<p>It can be useful to look at how APIs, which power open banking, are
applied in various countries to see what else corporates might expect
from open banking. In India, for example, the government has built a
host of advanced API-enabled financial systems that banks can plug into.
This has enabled banks to create new and exciting value propositions
for their clients.</p>
<p>For example, Citi’s Request to Pay Solution leverages India’s
Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) infrastructure and enables consumers to
make real-time bank debits from their account using a tokenised address
such as an email. For eCommerce companies selling in India, where card
penetration is low, this solution opens the door to a much broader range
of customers and gives them a low-cost collection method.</p>
<p>In China, the country which has arguably seen the biggest
intermediation of financial services from technology companies, banks
have been working with companies like Tencent and Alibaba to develop new
collection tools for corporates. To provide one example, Standard
Chartered has recently collaborated with Tencent’s WeChat Pay to create a
one-stop online collection solution for corporates in China. This
allows eCommerce companies in China to reach over 800m consumers in
China and benefit from improved reconciliation and payment processing.</p>
<h3 id=""thinking-ahead"">Thinking ahead</h3>
<p>Whilst it will take time for the new rules mandating open banking in
Europe to take hold, these are clearly exciting times and a lot of
change is expected over the coming years. It is unlikely that treasurers
will need to make any major changes right away. However, by gaining a
clearer understanding of their banks’ open banking strategies,
treasurers will be able to find out whether their providers are fully
embracing the opportunities. And as new and innovative solutions become
available in Europe, it will then be up to treasurers to understand how
these solutions might add value to their businesses.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>Might there be a future without banks? Perhaps. But what we do know is that the banks of the future will look and act very differently from how they do today. This article looks at the forces that are transforming banking, what banks are doing in response and what this all means for the corporate treasurer.</em></p>
<p>Back in 1994 Bill Gates famously said that “banking is essential, banks are not”. He might turn out to be right: over the past decade a combination of factors has begun to transform the financial industry. These forces have given rise to a plethora of non-bank players that are disrupting the incumbents and shaping a new vision for financial services.</p>
<p>This is happening right now. In China, for example, Alibaba processes hundreds of millions of transactions and owns one of the largest money funds in the world. Alibaba is a technology company, not a bank.</p>
<p>Across the world, there are numerous other examples of how technology companies have disrupted banking, especially retail banking. In the corporate space, however, the impact has been less pronounced. As custodians of their companies’ cash, treasurers are generally not in a hurry to ditch their long-standing and trusted banking partners for a small fintech – no matter how innovative the solution.</p>
<h3 id=""trusted-partner"">Trusted partner</h3>
<p>There are many reasons why banks remain the provider of choice in the corporate space. The main factor is that they are fully-regulated financial institutions, certified by central banks as trusted providers of financial services with privileged access to the underlying financial architecture. Many banks also have long and storied histories, acting as crucial institutions in the development of the markets they operate in, and as partners to the corporates that operate in those markets. These two factors, combined with the fact that until recently there has not been any other choice for corporates, has made banks indispensable partners to every organisation on the planet.</p>
<p>In the post-war era of globalisation, the role of the bank has arguably become more important for corporates who have spread their wings and ventured into new and exotic markets in pursuit of greater profits. In doing so, the banks have moved beyond being an indispensable partner simply because they take deposits, lend money and process payments. They have now become de-facto members of the treasury team, acting as trusted advisors and navigating the way for businesses as they move into new markets.</p>
<p>For Ebru Pakcan, EMEA Head of Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS) at Citi, the emergence of banks as advisors to their corporate clients has been the big change in how transaction banks operate over the past decade. “Banks have always been in the business of providing corporates with solutions and services to help them realise their objectives,” says Pakcan. “But what has changed is how we are now regarded as advisors to the business.”</p>
<p>Pakcan explains that banks have assumed this role because it is what clients have demanded. “In the past, many treasury teams were simply focused on executing the basic processes day-to-day,” she says. “Today, many treasury teams have a much broader remit and are regarded as a strategic partner to the business. This has led treasurers to turn to their banks for advice on what they can do to achieve their new strategic objectives.”</p>
<h3 id=""regulatory-leviathan"">Regulatory leviathan</h3>
<p>Whilst the growing advisory capacity of banks has been a big positive for many institutions, allowing them to foster deeper relationships with clients, there are also some negative forces impacting banks. Most notably these include the regulatory pressure, through Basel III for instance, that every bank in the world has been under post-crisis. These new regulatory pressures have had a profound impact and quite publicly put an end to the era of the global bank, forcing institutions to streamline, refocus and retrench.</p>
<p>This regulatory burden has also hamstrung banks in terms of their ability to be innovative – both in terms of the money they are willing to commit to innovation and the areas they are comfortable innovating in. This has inadvertently opened the door for non-bank providers to enter the market, giving rise to the age of fintech.</p>
<p>“Banks are in a tough spot and often come across as analogue players in a digital world,” says Don Raftery, Head of Commercial and Corporate Banking Practice at Greenwich Associates. “This is because at exactly the time when their customers are learning how fast, easy and transparent online service can be, banks are struggling to simply maintain the quality of service, because most of their technology spend is dedicated to addressing risk, security and compliance needs.”</p>
<h3 id=""fintech-pressure"">Fintech pressure</h3>
<p>Fintechs have jumped at the chance to take advantage of this opportunity and challenge the banks, most notably in the area of payments. These companies are doing so by leveraging new technology and creating value propositions that are deeply focused on solving specific pain points for customers – something that the banks, arguably, have not done in the past.</p>
<p>The dynamics between banking and fintech are constantly in flux and it has been a fascinating story to follow. Initially banks saw these disrupters as a threat: companies that could begin eating into significant chunks of banks’ profit margins. Over time, however, their stance has softened and banks now regard fintechs as potential partners that can help them serve their customers better. On the other side of the equation, many fintechs have realised their best chance for success is to align themselves with a bank to distribute their products and services.</p>
<p>A recent paper from Christine Barry, Research Director for Aite Group’s Wholesale Banking Practice, highlights this. “The acceptance of fintech companies as potential partners did not happen overnight,” says Barry. “In fact, it is part of a far greater shift in bank attitudes and buying behaviours around technology in general.” For Barry, the last few years have seen large banks begin to move away from fully building their own cash management solutions to instead deploying vendor-built solutions end-to-end or some components of these solutions.</p>
<p>“Several factors drive this shift in buying behaviour, including faster speed to market and the ability to build in areas in which there is a competitive advantage while outsourcing the rest,” adds Barry. “Additionally, technology has improved over the last few years. As such, solutions are far more customisable without having to touch code, and available functionality has widened.”</p>
<p>This change in buying behaviour is part of a wider shift in how banks operate as they seek to mimic fintechs and put the customer at the heart of everything they do. “The operating models of banks are profoundly changing,” says Winston Nesfield, Partner at Strategy&amp;. “Before, banks used to be organised around products. Now they are striving to put the customer at the heart of their operations and systems in order to embed themselves in the customer journey. We should not understate how big a shift this is, both in how banks operate and how their people think.”</p>
<h3 id=""the-right-people-in-the-right-place"">The right people in the right place</h3>
<p>Transforming the culture of the organisation by hiring the right people and giving them room to flourish is likely to be a big driver of success for banks in the coming years. In an interview with McKinsey &amp; Co, Piyush Gupta, CEO at DBS, commented that “we are up against businesses that work out of a garage, that take risks, operate in a nimble way and have a different kind of energy and drive. Large incumbent companies that can’t create a similar kind of culture just won’t be able to compete”. Indeed, the public aim of DBS is to be akin to a 20,000-person start-up.</p>
<p>DBS’ Head of Digital of Institutional Banking Group, Raof Latiff, offers more insight into how the bank is achieving this goal. “We have established various innovation project teams throughout the bank, they are left alone to work on improving products and processes, and bring new ideas to the table,” he says. “At the same time, we have trained staff around new ways of working, such as applying the agile methodology and following a customer journey process to encourage staff and clients to think innovatively and develop client centric solutions. Thus, we have started to cultivate a culture where it is encouraged to think outside of the box and experiment, and it is okay to even make mistakes as long as we learn from it.”</p>
<p>Erik Zingmark, Co-Head of Transaction Banking, EVP at Nordea explains that the Nordic bank has adopted a similar philosophy. “The people we hire today have a very different skillset to those we recruited five years ago,” he says. “We are also empowering our people to work differently, ensuring that creative people are not burdened by institutionalised reporting processes and other things that have traditionally hampered banks’ ability to innovate.”</p>
<h3 id=""immediate-improvements"">Immediate improvements</h3>
<p>Scanning the market, it is clear that these changes in thinking, culture, procurement and hiring at banks are having an impact on the products and services they are offering. Over the past year or so a seemingly endless list of bank product launches have leveraged all manner of existing and emerging technologies in an effort to solve pain points for clients.</p>
<p>The future of banks, though, is not dependent on digital product launches or on applying the “digital lipstick to products” as DBS’ Gupta so viscerally told McKinsey &amp; Co. It is about completely digitising the organisation end-to-end.</p>
<p>Treasury Today has had numerous conversations with banks around the world about how they are leveraging various technologies to improve their back office functions and offer a more seamless experience for clients using the bank. “Banks will not necessarily have to continuously release cutting-edge digital services to satisfy customers’ needs,” says Greenwich Associates’ Raftery. “Instead, they need to get the basics right and make it easier for their customers to do business with them.”</p>
<p>Granted, some may cynically say the banks are doing this to cut costs, and to a degree they are right. However, Strategy&amp;’s Nesfield is keen to point out that banks realise many products are commoditised, and that they will only retain and gain more customers by making themselves easy to work with. “As a result, banks are now looking to leverage technology not only to cut costs but also to ensure they keep business,” he says.</p>
<p>To put this into context, Citi’s Pakcan explains that it is crucial for banks to look at their process end-to-end and remove all the friction that exists. “To provide an example, we are working to digitise our call centre so that clients no longer need to pick up the phone to ask questions about the status of a payment,” she says. “Instead we want to provide that information into their eBanking portal using APIs, or allow them to ask a chatbot that will find the information for them. To do this, though, requires a big overhaul of our back office processes to ensure all the dots join up to deliver the correct information to our clients in a timely fashion.”</p>
<h3 id=""winning-advisory"">Winning advisory</h3>
<p>Revamping the back office and making sure that data is organised in a logical fashion and easily accessible to clients will also enable banks to be better advisors to clients. According to Greenwich Associates’ Raftery, this work is crucial because advisory will be “one of the enduring pillars of differentiation”.</p>
<p>Raftery goes on to say that “the true power of the advisory model will emerge when banks integrate ‘high-touch’ service with digital technology”. This will see banks use algorithms based on client inputs and industry data to inform solutions to clients’ short, medium and long-term goals – thereby enabling banks to “connect customers with products experts in areas critical to their business”.</p>
<p>For some banks, this is already becoming a reality. Citi, Nordea and a host of other banks have developed solutions that harness client and third-party data to show where improvements can be made and are using these to build more bespoke solutions for their clients.</p>
<p>DBS has also recently stepped into this area, taking a slightly different approach. Treasury Prism, a web-based solution, allows treasurers from around the world to upload data on their treasury structure and simulate what impact certain changes or the use of different liquidity and payment products will have. The solution suggests all the possible changes that can be made to their operating model today.</p>
<p>Explaining the thinking behind Treasury Prism, DBS’ Raof highlights that the bank was conscious not to develop a product to just simply push sales. “This tool gives treasury teams an easy way to evaluate their treasury management structures and see what improvements they can make or new structures they can work on without having to talk to the bank directly,” he says. “Of course, we would like them to come and speak to us down the line and we would follow up. But the main purpose of the tool is to get people thinking and share the knowledge that we have with anybody that wants to access it.”</p>
<h3 id=""future-gazing"">Future gazing</h3>
<p>What will a transaction bank look like in the future? Will there even be transaction banks? It is hard to say because as Nordea’s Zingmark notes: “The only guarantee you have when predicting the future is that you will be wrong.” With that in mind, Zingmark highlights how the strategy of Nordea is to develop a bank that is digital and nimble, thereby “allowing us to be able to meet customer demands as they evolve”.</p>
<p>This view is similar to the future of banking as predicted by Greenwich Associates’ Raftery. In his opinion, banks will prevail and the threat of non-bank financial services companies will subside as regulators scrutinise them more closely. “With electronic banking ubiquitous, large traditional providers transform into ‘digital banking superstores’,” he says. “Stripped of their technology advantage (and their regulatory advantage as well, assuming regulators act appropriately), non-banks will cede clients and share of wallet to the banks. At the same time, corporates will rediscover the benefits of one-stop shopping with large banks. Many remaining major fintech and non-bank providers will be acquired by banks, further enhancing banks’ technology prowess.”</p>
<p>For Strategy&amp;’s Nesfield, the question of whether or not banks will survive in the future is a simple one. “Banks need to make their offerings simpler, smaller and more connected to the customer,” he says. “To do this, banks need to stop being a destination you go to in order to use financial services and instead become an experience you consume as part of everyday life. They need to fit into our lifestyles and workstyles rather than us, the customer, fitting into their operating model. If they can do that then they can survive in a variation of their current form, and it will be more of an evolution than a revolution.”</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><i>In recent months, the APAC region’s banking sector has been undergoing significant change, as banks shuffle their packs, revisit their offerings, and they look to promote themselves as the corporate bank of choice in the region.</i></p>
<p>The most obvious sign of all this jostling for position is the number and level of seniority of new appointments in the region. As Treasury Today Asia recently reported, Carole Berndt – who held the role of Global Head, Transaction Services at RBS – will be joining Australian bank ANZ as its Managing Director of Global Transaction Banking in May. And in the last 12 months alone, ANZ has promoted Sameer Sawhney, the previous Managing Director of Global Transaction Banking to become Head of Global Banking, International and Institutional Banking. The bank also hired Farhan Faruqui from Citi, who was appointed CEO of International banking last year. And let’s not forget that Andrew Géczy left the UK’s Lloyds Bank to become ANZ’s CEO International and Institutional Banking in 2013.</p>
<p>Of course, there are other elements to the picture: ANZ has been losing executives, as well as hiring them. Hong Kong Head, Susan Yuen, and China Head, Charles Li, both resigned in mid-2014 with Yuen becoming Chief Executive Officer (CEO) for The National Bank of Abu Dhabi in Asia. But overall, the trend for aggressive hiring within the top echelons of the regional banks is hard to ignore.</p>
<p>DBS, for example, has also joined the war for talent – largely to keep up with increasing demand from multinational corporates looking to use regional financial institutions. DBS’s growing focus on its transaction business was highlighted by the recent hiring of 30 year industry veteran, John Laurens, from HSBC as the bank’s new Head of Global Transaction Services.</p>
<p>The story is quite different for some of the established European names in the region, however. RBS have announced that it will be substantially reducing its market presence in APAC, including its cash management business, as the bank looks to continue to shed its non-UK banking operations and focus on its UK and Western European customers. Last year, Barclays also announced that it would be cutting back its Asian operations, including its investment bank.</p>
<h3 id=""drivers-of-change"">Drivers of change</h3>
<p>Before we analyse the impact of these recent changes on both corporates and the banking sector itself, it is important to understand why they are happening.</p>
<p>“Banks are prioritising more, in regard to both the geographies they operate in and the clients they service,” says Alan Huse, Acting Managing Director of Global Transaction Banking at ANZ. “There is also a more disciplined approach across the banks surrounding cost and capital management and the focus has shifted away from trying to be everything to everyone to deepening relationships with fewer clients.” Basel III is exacerbating this trend as some banks are finding it increasingly difficult to support, or at least justify, certain business areas.</p>
<p>Other reasons for the shifts in the region’s banks are more fundamental, and localised. Dianne Challenor, Head of Treasury Services, Asia Pacific at J.P. Morgan explained: “A large part of the evolution in the region’s banking landscape has been driven by the increasing sophistication and expansion of the banking infrastructure.”</p>
<p>The payments infrastructure is one area in particular that has been bolstered in recent years. The Faster Payments initiative is already live in Singapore and both India and Australia are currently in the processes of establishing more sophisticated payment systems. “Once these are live there will be another step change in the way that banking services are offered in these countries,” adds Challenor. But what does all this mean for corporate treasurers and how is it impacting their day-to-day banking?</p>
<h3 id=""number-one-priority"">Number one priority</h3>
<p>Data from the 2014 Treasury Today Asia Pacific Corporate Treasury Benchmarking Study suggests that corporates are at least aware of the changing dynamic in the Asian banking landscape – placing bank relationships as their top priority moving into 2015.</p>
<p>The increasing regulatory burden was highlighted as a key reason that corporates are taking a closer look at their banking relationships, if the banks are pulling away from areas that they don’t have a competitive advantage in, some corporates may need to look elsewhere for bank support. The alternative argument put forth by the regulators and some of the banks is that this shift will actually benefit corporates through the ability to offer more focused services.</p>
<p>As of yet, corporates have not felt any of this benefit. But then again, neither have they been overly perturbed by shifts in the sector, it seems. “With the banks we work with, primarily international banks, we don’t see any retrenching,” says Sebastian Rieder, Treasury Manager Asia at Lenzing AG. “There are constantly new services and products that they are offering in China”.</p>
<p>The share of business that Lenzing offers it banks – both local and international – in the region has also largely remained the same. “For our company, the local banks are still better for local business and the international banks are better for international business.” This is not to say that the international banks can’t meet Lenzing’s local needs, but it’s more a reflection on quality and value. “For local issues in China, the international banks just can’t match in terms of service and price. We constantly monitor this and until the international banks can match the local banks, there will be no fundamental changes.”</p>
<h3 id=""targeting-the-market"">Targeting the market</h3>
<p>What Rieder is highlighting is that all banks in the region have their own particular areas of strength. Munir Nanji, Regional Head of Sales for Treasury and Trade Solutions at Citi Asia Pacific pointed out: “The banks in the region can be segmented by those international players who have a significant local footprint, such as Citi, HSBC and Standard Chartered. This is arguably the most competitive sector as we are not only competing for the business flowing into Asia but also the outflow business from Asia into Europe and the Americas.” Nanji highlights that to compete successfully in the sector requires an international outlook with a local focus. “We have a global platform that corporates around the world use, but we also have on the ground teams that can assist our clients with their local needs.”</p>
<p>The other international banks in the region operate slightly differently in so far has having a reduced local footprint in a number of the region’s key markets. Instead of having their own presence, these banks leverage the local banks’ reach in these markets and build correspondent banking networks which their clients can leverage. The ‘bread and butter’ of these banks has historically been the inbound business from multinationals coming from Europe and the US into the region, with a strong focus on payments and liquidity. However, as corporates in the region have grown and expanded beyond the region, these banks have also been able to capture a portion of the outbound business in their areas of strength.</p>
<p>The final sector of banks to include is the Asian-parented banks that operate primarily on a local level, leveraging their branch network and strong balance sheet to offer collections and local credit facilities, mainly to local corporates. The majority of multinationals operating in Asia Pacific will be familiar with this need to leverage the region’s local banks to meet their local business needs. And it makes sense – the focus of many of these local banks has been to ensure that their domestic and regional offerings are as good as they can be, and suitable for increasingly complex domestic and multinational clients. They don’t have the complexities of global banks, nor do they want to directly compete with them.</p>
<h3 id=""regional-players-rising"">Regional players rising</h3>
<p>However, some regional banks, such as DBS and ANZ, are stepping up to take on the global banks. In recent years, they have built up their cross-border offerings, taking advantage of their large domestic client base and the growing trade flows between their domestic market and the rest of Asia. By supporting these domestic corporates as they expand abroad, banks such as ANZ and DBS have been able to take advantage of the infrastructure they have built and challenge for business that they wouldn’t have been able to previously. “It is our ambition to be the leading bank in APAC and to be the Asian bank of choice globally,” says John Laurens, Managing Director and Head of Global Transaction Services at DBS. “We aim to make banking simpler, smarter and more intuitive through our digital agenda and we are very much on this journey.”</p>
<p>ANZ has implemented a super-regional strategy, which was launched in 2007 by CEO Mike Smith. The strategy focuses on obtaining an increasing proportion of earnings from Asia, the Pacific, Europe and America (APEA), rather than ANZ’s traditional markets in Australia and New Zealand. “We are the most international of the Australian banks and the most Australian of the international banks and already well established in the trade finance space,” says Huse. “We are therefore building our regional cash capability across the markets in which we operate and looking to provide single-country and pan-regional cash management and trade solutions using our home markets of Australia and New Zealand as an anchor.”</p>
<h3 id=""the-impact-of-top-level-appointments"">The impact of top level appointments</h3>
<p>Hiring Berndt, who brings a wealth of expertise to the role, can only help ANZ to fulfil this strategy. As Scott Engle, Group Treasurer at AIA Group Limited, puts it: “it has been my observation that when a bank goes ahead and hires a first class professional from the market in a space such as transaction banking they don’t do it without committing more resources to build that business.”</p>
<p>Across the region, healthy competition for experienced executives is instrumental in spurring the sector’s development. “From my perspective, it is great that the region is attracting such talent,” says J.P. Morgan’s Challenor. “These people will ultimately bring different experiences and expertise into the region that will facilitate further innovation and also drive up the already outstanding level of talent in the region. In turn, this can only improve the range of services that we offer corporates in the market.”</p>
<p>For corporates, the impact of these hires is less important. “While I think the banks have some very good ideas in place when they make these decisions, at least – for now – these changes don’t have a huge impact. They may further down the line, however, once the new heads implement their changes and if a new strategy is announced,” says Engle.</p>
<p>Something that may have a more direct impact on corporates in APAC, however, is the commitment the banks have to the market. ANZ and DBS show signals of intent with their appointments, but for George Nast, Global Head of Product Management and Client Access, Transaction Banking at Standard Chartered, corporates need to dig further than the headlines. “Corporates in the region shouldn’t be concerned about the movements of executives in the region’s banks,” he says. “The key area that they should focus on when deciding which bank to work with is the bank’s commitment to the market. The last decade has been riddled with banks that have entered the market and then left because it has been too difficult and expensive a region to crack. So corporates need to ask their banks what their commitment to the market is and then to see how their bank can achieve this.”</p>
<h3 id=""sharing-the-region"">Sharing the region</h3>
<p>But with the regional banks expanding will there be space for both the regional and global banks moving forward? “As the market and economies in the region continue to grow, and the trade flows continue to accelerate, there will be room for everybody in the market – as long as each bank understands what it does well and offers these services to their clients,” Engle notes.</p>
<p>Standard Chartered’s Nast also believes that there is space for both in the region and doesn’t see the challenge from the regional players manifesting anytime soon. “The reality is that it took Standard Chartered 160 years to build the 70 market network that we have,” he comments. “It takes a lot of time to build a global mandate and even a pan-Asian mandate. Currently these banks are good in single markets, but they are yet to be material players on pan-regional mandates.” It may also be difficult for these banks to reach global status, he believes. “The environment that we now operate in will mean that it is increasingly expensive and difficult due to a host of factors which include regulation, compliance and the cost of infrastructure.”</p>
<p>Citi’s Munir Nanji highlights another challenge facing the regional banks. “Transaction banking is not a very complex business,” he says, “you need to offer a current account, but the challenge then is how to nurture these accounts and extract maximum value. This is done by offering value add services such as advisory, analytics, thought leadership and a global standardised network that is intuitive. It is in these spaces where it becomes harder for regional banks to match the global banks.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, Laurens believes that some banks in the region, such as DBS, are already matching the global banks in certain areas of transaction banking, having received global awards highlighting their progress. “If you look at DBS in areas such as supply chain finance, then I would argue that we are already ahead of the global banks in this space and this is then leading us to improve in other areas such as working capital advisory and put further investment in our core cash management capabilities in both presence and non-presence markets.”</p>
<p>Looking to the future, Laurens believes that there will be additional shifts in the banking landscape due to new technology. “Banks such as DBS are not burdened by the legacy technology that many banks have and we are therefore able to build from a modern platform that puts the customer and the heart of what we do in order to be ahead of the curve in meeting their demands.”</p>
<p>But the real lynchpin for deciding which bank wins pole position in the region will be China. Some banks in the country are as large, if not larger, than the global banks in terms of total assets managed. However, many have yet to make their mark outside of China and remain largely domestic in focus. It seems only a matter of time before these banks enter the regional and global marketplace, potentially causing a seismic shift. For the time being however, the trend seems to be for outsiders to capture market share in China.</p>
<p>Overall, the message is that in 2015 treasurers should keep a close watch on their key banking partners’ strategies and ambitions in order to ensure they achieve full benefit from these relationships and leverage any opportunities that may arise.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The Payment Services Directive (PSD) came into force on 1<sup>st</sup> November 2009 with the goal of making payments across Europe more efficient and easier to understand. The European Commission is now in the process of replacing PSD with PSD2, which is currently starting its First Reading in the Trilogue negotiations as part of the EU’s Ordinary Legislative Procedure. Each of the three main EU institutions: the European Commission, European Parliament and Council of the EU have reached their own individual positions on the new laws, and will work together to agree a final text of the new Directive through this process, with an agreement possibly reached by Q215. Following agreement, EU Member States have two years to transpose any new agreements into national legislation.</p>
<p>The European Commission’s objectives for PSD2 are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Contribute to a further integrated and efficient European payments market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve the level playing field for payment service providers (including for new players).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure a high level of consumer protection and of payments security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage lower prices for payments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facilitate the emergence of common technical standards and interoperability.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The major alterations envisaged by the Commission’s proposal are primarily consumer-focused. For example, providers of so-called ‘payment initiation services’ and ‘account information services,’ who are currently unregulated, will be brought into scope. New rules regarding the security of internet payments will also require payment service providers to use strong customer authentication by adopting multi-layered practices which will better protect customers from a data breach.</p>
<p>While the main implementation impact of PSD2 will be felt by payment service providers (PSPs), there are some elements of the proposals which are likely to be of interest to treasurers. The draft legislation seeks to extend the scope to one-leg transactions (where either the payer’s or payee’s PSP is located outside the European Economic Area) and non-EU currencies, although precisely which provisions will apply will need to be agreed during the Trilogue process as there are differing views held by the Commission, Parliament and Council on this topic.</p>
<p>The present version of the Payment Services Directive (PSD1) – in Article 3(n) – exempts “payment transactions between a parent undertaking and its subsidiary or between subsidiaries of the same parent undertaking.” This exemption remains in place in PSD2. However, the Council of the EU, in its General Approach, proposes a new Recital to provide some context, which appears to seek to allay concerns expressed by the European Association of Corporate Treasurers (EACT). The EACT had identified some problems arising from transposition of PSD1 as to whether or not the intra-group exemption, mentioned above, applies. The Council’s suggested new Recital recognises this by stating: “One of the main objectives of the introduction of SEPA was to facilitate the creation of pan-European payment factories and allow the creation of collection factories, centralising all transactions of a corporate group, using the ‘on behalf’ functionalities.” The new Recital is, of course, subject to agreement on it being reached during Trilogue.</p>
<p>Article 51 of PSD1 relates to the scope of rights and obligations in relation to the provision and use of payment services. It allows PSPs to opt out of applying a number of provisions to corporate clients, subject to the clients’ agreement. One such example is the irrevocability of a payment order. This corporate opt-out remains unchanged in PSD2 (Article 54). Furthermore, there is no change to the maximum execution time of payment orders introduced in PSD1.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) seeks to achieve a number of objectives that not only build upon the laws implemented in the original PSD regulation, but also reflect changes that have occurred in the payments industry. For example, since the original PSD was introduced, there has been a boom in the uptake of mobile and e-payment solutions. Partly due to this, we have seen the gradual disaggregation of the payments chain as different providers, often independent of banks, enter the payments process at different points.</p>
<p>It is expected that PSD2 will introduce a myriad of small amendments together with a number of significant changes, most notably bringing third party payment providers (TPPs) under the scope of the regulation. Including TPPs under the legislative umbrella will impact the industry in a number of ways, such as: encouraging adoption of this business model by requiring existing market players to adapt in order to work with TPPs in a standardised way; and increasing the payment options available that merchants can offer customers.</p>
<p>Another area that PSD2 is likely to impact is so-called one-leg payment transactions, (payments that are made from within the EU to outside it or vice versa) and also intra-EU, non-EU currency transactions, such as dollar or yen payments. These types of transactions largely fell outside the scope of the original PSD and many countries therefore took different approaches to regulating them. PSD2 seeks to harmonise these rules and create a more consistent environment, something that will be welcomed by corporate treasurers.</p>
<p>Of course, any new law can have unintended consequences if the wording is not sufficiently precise. From a corporate treasury perspective, an example of where discussion has been taking place to avoid this risk in relation to PSD2 concerns the wording of the article that seeks to exclude parent-subsidiary payment transactions from the scope of the Directive. If the final text were not to be carefully worded, there could be a chance of those corporates operating shared services centres being classed as providing payment services, requiring them to be regulated as such. However, this is highly unlikely to happen since legislators are well aware of this potential issue.</p>
<p>While the changes are expected to be far more incremental than the original PSD, and should not have a dramatic impact on corporate treasurers, they can’t be detached from the process. At this stage, therefore, corporate treasurers should keep track of the developments and leverage their peer groups and banking providers to ensure that they are aware of any important details that may arise from the ongoing PSD2 process.</p>

<p>The number of exemptions available will be reduced under PSD2, and the scope of the remaining available exemptions will be narrowed. These changes will need to be carefully reviewed by all firms that have sought to rely on any exemptions under the PSD.</p>
<p>In light of rapid technological developments in the payments space and different implementation and interpretations of the provisions of PSD by European <br/>
regulators, the European Commission published, in July 2013, proposals for a new Payment Services Directive (PSD2) to repeal and replace PSD.</p>
<p>PSD2 will increase the scope of regulation. First, the geographical scope will be increased in that certain provisions (relating to transparency of terms and conditions and information requirements) will apply to ‘one-legged’ transactions namely, transactions where either the payer’s or the payee’s payment service provider (rather than both the payer or payee) is located outside the EEA. Secondly, under PSD2, the abovementioned transparency and information requirements will apply to all currencies, not just to EU currencies as is the case under PSD. Thirdly, PSD2 introduces two new payment services: a payment initiation service and an account information service.</p>
<p>Some of the most relevant conduct of business changes in PSD2 relate to security requirements, liability for unauthorised transactions and refunds.</p>
<p>PSD2 introduces new requirements relating to operational and security risks. These include requiring a Payment Service Provider (PSP) to: (i) report security incidents and provide annual information on its assessment of the operational and security risks associated with its payment services; (ii) notify its customers directly and without undue delay if a security incident might impact the financial interests of those customers; and (iii) apply ‘strong customer authentication’ in respect of electronic payment transactions.</p>
<p>With regard to unauthorised transactions, the maximum liability that a payment user will have for such transactions will be reduced from €150 (as it was under PSD) to €50. In addition, in the case of late execution of a payment transaction, the payer can opt to have the amount value-dated at the date the amount should have been received instead of having the amount refunded.</p>
<p>Refund rights in the case of direct debit transactions are to be broadened under PSD2 so that a payer will have an unconditional right of refund within eight weeks of the debit date (as long as the payee has not already fulfilled its contractual obligations).</p>
<p>PSD2 updates the existing regulatory framework on payment services by bringing into its scope payment service providers that were previously unregulated and addressing issues such as transparency and security of payments through new payment channels. During the two year implementation period, efforts will need to be made to ensure that PSD2 is applied in a consistent and co-ordinated manner across the EU if objectives such as the SEPA area are to be realised. Firms will also need to carefully review the application and scope of PSD2 in light of the proposed changes including those mentioned above.</p>

Banking clubs: obsolete?,"


<p><em>As the big banks began to collaborate with smaller, local financial institutions to form partner networks, some began to question the validity of banking clubs in the post-crisis world. But rather than threatening their existence, the fallout from the global banking crisis presents an opportunity for banking clubs to extend their influence, provided they can also extend their coverage.</em></p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>For a time, the global expansionist policies of the major banking groups appeared to weaken the rationale for the banking club. However, as certain banks have scaled back their international ambitions, the appeal of being able to continue to offer services in locations where they no longer have (or never had) a direct presence has become increasingly evident.</p>
<p>Looking at the main banking clubs, Unicash and Unico are more Europe/Americas focused, whereas Bob Lyddon, General Secretary of the International Banking Association (IBOS) explains that his membership extends beyond Europe and the US into Mexico, Brazil and Chile, covering approximately 80% of Latin American GDP. Connector and TES are also starting to cover Asia Pacific and the Middle East, but still have more work to do to achieve significant coverage and access, says Capco partner Bernd Richter. “Part of a banking club’s offering (and value for its members) is to provide access to branch infrastructure in a target country for services such as cash collections, account opening/identification support or other services that require local physical presence. These services will not become obsolete, especially for banks in a competitive world where money transfer agencies are growing.”</p>
<p>With European and North American companies doing more business than ever in emerging markets, there is increasing demand for banks to have solutions which enable them to support their clients internationally. It is therefore important that the existing banking clubs extend their coverage across Asia, Latin America and Africa says Stephen Everett, Managing Director of segment propositions at Lloyds Banking Group, which is a member of both Connector and Unicash.</p>
<p>He also sees the clubs evolving from largely referral-based arrangements to stronger alliances along similar lines to the Oneworld airline alliance, a virtual network where it is not just about referring a customer to a known contact but more about what that bank can do to help the customer set up their international business and deliver products and services that are consistent with their home market.</p>
<p>Alliances are attractive since few banks can justify having their own network (unless they have scalable retail and mid-market businesses in the country) given the cost of running technology, connecting to the local clearing systems and meeting local capital requirements. “These factors, coupled with differences in regulation around customer identification and anti-money laundering legislation, mean the costs of maintaining this infrastructure will lead to increased demand for co-ordinated partnering via alliances, rather than through multiple bilateral agreements,” says Everett.</p>
<p>Richter observes that bilateral agreements (correspondent banking) are still an important part of the corporate banking world for payments, cash management and trade services. However, he describes banking clubs as an attractive alternative to operating full blown bilateral agreements with the associated complex legal paperwork for covering countries with only occasional flows. “Ongoing M&amp;A activity between banking groups will drive down the addressable space for banking clubs, but they still have room to grow and add value. From a geographic coverage perspective, they create more opportunities for banks to join rather than to manage bilateral relationships independently,” he notes.</p>
<h3 id=""shifting-sands"">Shifting sands</h3>
<p>To a certain extent, non-bank service providers (such as Earthport) have targeted some of the product and services spaces of banking clubs and financial technology companies may provide other parts of the solution in the near future, Richter adds. “From a banking club perspective this can be seen as a threat or as an opportunity to co-operate with these innovators to enhance the existing banking club franchise.”</p>
<p>Ruth Wandhöfer, Global Head of Regulatory and Market Strategy, Citi, observes that bilateral arrangements have become more common in recent years. “Given some of the major changes on the regulatory and infrastructure side, more bilateral arrangements and partnering has been taking place as individual institutions have reviewed their business models and non-core activity has been outsourced. This trend is likely to continue for some time until the regulatory reform has settled.” However, she also feels that the role of the banking club with a slightly broader focus on all payment service providers continues to be very relevant.</p>
<p>Lyddon refers to the retrenchment of banks running their own networks “to the extent that there appears to be quite a common earnings requirement that each link in the network earns $25,000 per annum, which can be difficult to reach when the network bank’s service offering may be quite limited in certain locations.” IBOS banks are full-service banks and so have a business model that can accommodate the subsidiaries of medium-large parent companies, whereas network banks are concentrating only on the very largest, he continues. “This can give rise to a situation where one part of a network bank is proposing its own network to its largest clients and a different division is proposing IBOS to the medium-large customers.”</p>
<p>He accepts that the number of bilateral arrangements has risen but suggests that the substance of such arrangements varies widely, from agreements to exchange MT101 messages for an individual customer all the way to integrated IT solutions involving reference accounts. “Each step along the way differs. Reference accounts have the advantage of quicker set-up and single point of customer service, but then you have the drawbacks of a very limited local service range, no local relationship manager/customer service and no access to local credit products such as card, direct debit origination and loans.</p>
<p>“It can work well for certain types of very centralised customers but is not a panacea. It is also expensive to establish and is usually constructed on a one-way basis: a global bank engages a partner, who invests heavily on their side in the expectation of large volumes.”</p>
<p>Lyddon says his organisation is sceptical as to whether the efforts of the financial institutions teams of many banks trying to set up bilateral arrangements are a response to real volumes or to a desire to have ‘flags on a map’.</p>
<p>“IBOS works to a service template, with sets of capabilities stated as requirements to back up each of the value points. Our aim is to enable member banks to help their customers in other countries; the service has to perform on some real basics, without which you never get as far as delivering intraday and previous day reporting, MT101 services and cash pooling. Looked at from the point of view of the introducing bank, they need a system that will respond when they have a client who needs an account and services.”</p>
<p>Rather than diluting the value of the banking club concept, he suggests that mergers, acquisitions and partnerships have enabled IBOS to expand its network through the existing members as an alternative to testing the governance model by engaging with many more individual banks to obtain the same coverage. M&amp;A activity by KBC, Nordea, UniCredit and Santander has added 14 banks to the list of IBOS associate members.</p>
<p>“On the other hand, member banks may have viewed IBOS as a stopgap along the way to having their own comprehensive network whereas, thanks to retrenchment in the industry, IBOS offers coverage of areas for which member banks will not have coverage themselves within the foreseeable future. “Indeed, they may sell off an interest and then it is very convenient if the bank from which they have divested remains in IBOS, so that existing customer business can be managed via the network instead of via their own network. That in turn can mean that the business is managed from the same team with minimum disruption.”</p>

<p>According to Richter, initiatives such as SEPA have not diminished the value of the banking club concept, while Lyddon observes that significant countries and even regions of Europe remain outside the Eurozone. “The line of business that has become far less important is non-resident accounts for local collections – that requirement can often be satisfied with just one euro account in the SEPA area rather than one in each country. However, there are still the non-euro countries: the UK, the Scandinavian countries and several in Central and Eastern Europe.”</p>
<p>The shrinkage in non-resident accounts in euro within the SEPA area is offset by the continuing need to hold in-country accounts for resident entities, he continues. “Considerations around tax, business model and decentralisation still leave a market requiring international banking services and, while there is a trend towards centralisation and to emulate the shared services models of very large companies, it is noticeable that medium- to large-sized companies remain quite decentralised.” Lloyds Banking Group sees itself as having an intermediary role to play between the local partner bank and the customer, says Gavin Maclean, Head of Payment Product.</p>
<p>“We will facilitate the account opening process and this can save the customer a great deal of time. It will be very obvious to the customer that we are working with the partner bank and this is important because the customer is entering a legal agreement with that bank.”</p>
<p>Banking clubs have created sophisticated but standardised process handling interfaces between remote initiating banks and the branches of a foreign bank executing locally and the same principle applies to the handling of AML rules, adds Richter. “Banking clubs are already benefiting from exchanging KYC and AML data for on-boarding purposes. They are impacted by these regulations, but can better share and help clients to keep the effort of account opening processes in the club to a minimum.”</p>
<p>Ulster Bank made the decision to become a full member of IBOS two years ago, having been an associate member for a number of years before that explains Lisa Taggart, Relationship Director Corporate and Institutional banking. “A lot of the activity we see from IBOS is on the inbound side, particularly for US companies locating in Ireland who are banked with US financial institutions that are not network banks. For example, we regularly work with customers of Silicon Valley Bank to offer them local services and would have weekly calls with the bank to discuss implementation plans.”</p>
<p>As part of RBS, Ulster Bank customers are part of a network that can provide local banking services in many countries outside Ireland. But when an RBS branch is not available in a particular country, Taggart can tap into IBOS and her customers benefit from a level of standardised account opening procedures and established relationships. Therefore, the experience of opening an account becomes more akin to the process that exists within the RBS group.</p>
<p>As the larger network banks may have differing criteria for what type of customer and level of business they are willing to take on, she says membership of a banking club ensures her customers can access full-service banking that is appropriate for their size and growth potential. “This is particularly important for companies that are just starting to trade abroad and have a business plan that might involve testing the market for 12-18 months on a modest scale. It also represents a valuable added service for us in terms of customer retention, especially for corporates who require access to the local clearing system in countries where RBS may not have a presence.”</p>
<p>As an IBOS member, Taggart can certify documents for her customers that are accepted by other banks and likewise Ulster Bank accepts documents certified by other IBOS members. “Having a list of authorised signatories for each bank removes the need to engage notary publics or independent accountants and therefore speeds up the account opening and customer identification process. This is one example of how we do everything we can to behave like a single entity.”</p>
<h3 id=""more-to-give"">More to give</h3>
<p>She is convinced that banking clubs will become more relevant. “A lot of work has been done in the last few years within the IBOS banks around streamlining the KYC process, for example. Now these processes are approved and implemented, the number of customers referred to us and the number of customers we refer to other IBOS members can increase.”</p>
<p>This trend will be further boosted by network bank retrenchment, she concludes. “It is evident that network banks are focusing more on their core markets. While bilateral agreements will continue to be reached, our preference would be to further grow the number of banks within IBOS, given that we have tried and tested procedures in place.”</p>
<p>Lyddon acknowledges that banking clubs have been impacted by anti-money laundering and ‘know your customer’ regulations, but adds that the workload has increased for all participants in the banking industry. “The need to do these checks in each location is one of the reasons behind network banks wanting to earn $25,000 per location. The IBOS approach has been to try to maintain a consistent process even if specific documentary requirements for each bank initially diverged. Our observation is that the requirements are starting to converge again thanks to FATF 2012 recommendations.</p>
<p>“The IBOS approach is to have designated contacts at each bank, a consistent method of initiating a referral and finding out whether it is ‘go’ or ‘no go’, full visibility of what the documentary requirements will be for a particular bank and a consistent method of working through the process, backed by escalation procedures. But we cannot have just one account opening document for the whole network.”</p>
<p>The key question, according to Lyddon, is whether this can add value to the banks and the customers when network banks will only take very large customers into their network; many local banks have stopped doing accounts for non-residents or even residents who have foreign beneficial ownership; and many banks have been clearing out smaller customers or requiring very high monthly account opening fees.</p>
<p>“For a treasurer to try to set up banking remotely in a new country, the fall-back of selecting a local bank themselves in each country has declined due to the ‘foreign beneficial ownership’ issue. Then the option of using a network bank may not be there if that network bank has retrenched or if the customer falls below the threshold. So KYC is in a way an opportunity for IBOS as, within what is a network of trusted third parties, each bank can trust the authenticity of the documents sent by an IBOS partner.”</p>
<p>The ability to offer clients specific liquidity and cash management structures across a set of countries and regions, combined with the ability for local cash collections and remittances, drives the value of clubs, adds Richter. This enables their members to offer these services at a competitive pricing point and compete against large global network banks.</p>
<p>According to Lyddon, it is a commonly held misconception that banking clubs cannot offer cash pooling. “IBOS has offered a same-day value overnight cash pooling service since 2000 (in euros) that moves the entire available balance in the ‘slave’ bank and transfers it to the ‘master’ bank,” he concludes. “We have more than 200 customers using this service.”</p>
<p>In short, banking clubs have evolved significantly in the years post-crisis, and are arguably more relevant than ever.</p>


","As the big banks began to collaborate with smaller, local financial institutions to form partner networks, some began to question the validity of banking clubs in the post-crisis world. But rather than threatening their existence, the fallout from the global banking crisis presents an opportunity for banking clubs to extend their influence, provided they can also extend their coverage.",https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/banking/industry-analysis/rowing-team-race-190772942.jpg,2015-02-01,Industry Analysis,False
