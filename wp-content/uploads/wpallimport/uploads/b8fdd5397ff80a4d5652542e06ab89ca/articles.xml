<p>After gaining her Bachelor of Science in Pharmacology from the University College London, Cecilia went on to acquire a Masters in Banking and International Finance. Following her placement with GSK as a research analyst, she joined the Noble Group as a management trainee. Since then she has gained a wide experience of all aspects of treasury, including credit, cash and capital management, market risk and foreign exchange.</p>
<p>In September 2020, Cecilia joined BeiGene, a biotech pharmaceutical company specialising in the discovery and development of innovative and affordable medicines for the treatment of cancer. As Head of Global Treasury, she heads a team of ten across China, Hong Kong, Switzerland and the United States. She was the Overall Winner of the Adam Smith Awards Asia 2021 in the Best Cash Management Solution category.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4>Tell us about your current role and responsibilities.</h4>
<p>I joined BeiGene almost two years ago as Global Treasury Director. My current role is to look after cash management, investment, FX hedging and financing for the group. While I have been here, I have been able to use my previous experiences to build a global treasury and a first-class team for the company.</p>
<h4>What advice would you give to women in finance in terms of establishing and developing a career?</h4>
<p>Firstly, if you want to have a rewarding and long-lasting career, you need to find a job or a role that really interests you. It’s also important to know what you want to achieve – whether that’s making improvements to operational efficiency, driving industry excellence, or by bringing a greater awareness of treasury to the management or the wider company.</p>
<p>I would also say it’s important to continue your learning so that you are equipped with the right skills and knowledge to help you advance. And last – but not least – have a work coach who is senior to you who you can approach to seek advice and guidance.</p>
<h4>Would you recommend having a defined career plan or being open and flexible?</h4>
<p>I think there is no set answer for this. Either path can lead to success, as long as it works for you.</p>
<p>In the beginning, when I was starting out in my career, it was extremely flexible. I was open in terms of looking at areas even outside of finance, and I was also flexible in terms of location. Having this approach helped me in terms of gaining a wider experience of, and a greater exposure to, different things. Over time it has become clearer what my objectives should be and what I want to achieve, so that I can concentrate on more concrete goals, but this has happened slowly.</p>
<h4>What can women do to make their voices heard within an organisation?</h4>
<p>One thing that I have learned over the course of my career is the importance of being able to influence people. In order to do that, you need to have the right attitude and mindset, and you need to provide additional value – not only to your immediate team, but also the wider company. The company and senior management always welcome opinions from all different angles, provided that these are constructive, and you can demonstrate the value of particular projects or ideas.</p>
<h4>What is your greatest inspiration?</h4>
<p>I have had a lot of role models and coaches at different stages of my life. Their paths are the best guidance I could learn from and help me to find ways to reach the next stage.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><h4 id="the-perfect-combination">The perfect combination</h4>
<p>After gaining her degree in pharmacology, Cecilia went on to achieve a masters in banking and international finance. Following a placement year at GSK, she started her treasury career in the Noble Group, gaining experience of all aspects of the treasury function.</p>
<p>In 2012 she joined McKinsey &amp; Company, the global management consulting firm, where she helped to set up its treasury in the Asia Pacific region, a role that she reprised at her next position at the biotech company Amgen. When Cecilia joined BeiGene in 2020 to head up its global treasury, its position as an innovative pharmaceutical company was a perfect match for her qualifications in both pharmacology and finance.</p>
<p>“It was like finding my true home,” she enthuses. “I have been able to leverage all my previous experiences to build a world class treasury and a first-rate team for the company. We have a global team of ten people covering North America, EMEA and APAC to match our company’s footprint. The team is mainly based in Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Basel and New Jersey, which allows us to cover all regions seamlessly.”</p>
<h4 id="adapting-to-adversity">Adapting to adversity</h4>
<p>While she fully acknowledges the difficulties of the past two years, Cecilia is quick to point out the successes as well. “Of course there were times that the offices could not be accessed, and the team had to work remotely,” she recalls. “But we are in a much better position compared to other industries.” For one thing, being able to implement contingency procedures meant that the team knew how to seek assistance and information if required. “Leadership guidance is an important factor, ensuring that all resources are utilised so that we can achieve the same goals,” Cecilia adds.</p>
<p>Since the treasury team is based at various locations around the globe, work that needs to be done is not confined to the standard working day. “Collaboration and communication are key. When the team based in the Asia Pacific region finishes for the day, the team in the United States can continue the work during their daytime,” she says. “We can keep things moving by following the sun around the world.”</p>
<p>During the recent challenging times the company has not only been able to continue sales and delivery of its products, but has continued to move ahead at full speed. At the end of 2021 BeiGene completed its IPO on the Science and Technology Innovation Board (STAR Market) of the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The STAR Offering, one of the largest of the year, raised over RMB20bn (US$3.4bn) for the company. “In the latest quarter, our revenue is up 146% compared to the prior year,” notes Cecilia, “which is tremendous given the challenging environment.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the treasury team has had a number of other projects to work on. “We have set up two cash pools in China and opened over 70 bank accounts worldwide,” she reflects. “And that’s in addition to rolling out SAP host-to-host connectivity in all regions last year.”</p>
<h4 id="valuing-diversity">Valuing diversity</h4>
<p>On another note, Cecilia believes that BeiGene’s commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) is second to none. “Our company has been doing extremely well in this area,” she says. “In April this year the company refreshed its comprehensive environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategy.” As part of the ESG strategy and framework, Change is the Cure, BeiGene has identified ‘Empowering Our People: Diversity, Equity, &amp; Inclusion and Colleague Engagement &amp; Well-Being’ as one of five strategic priorities.</p>
<p>Noting that Julia Wang was appointed as the company’s global CFO last year, Cecilia says the business environment has never been friendlier towards women: “So many companies now offer coaching and career development programmes for women. I know of many women’s groups which meet regularly – these are all good opportunities for us to explore our career goals and get advice.”</p></div>

<h3 class="fn" style="margin-bottom:5px;">Lavender Murray</h3>
<h5 class="title">Manager, Sustainable Finance</h5>
<p><img alt="TC Energy logo" class="org" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/logo/tc-energy-logo-2022.svg?la=en&amp;hash=B0BE08AC17799455FDE14381680BEFF8" style="margin-top:1.5em;" title="TC Energy logo" width="130"/></p>
<p>Founded in 1951, TC Energy (formerly known as TransCanada Corporation) is a North American energy company headquartered in Alberta, Canada. It is one of the largest energy infrastructure companies in North America, with pipeline, power and storage assets of over CA$100bn as at end of 2021. Today the company has an extraordinary opportunity to lead the energy transition – developing solutions to move, generate and store the energy North America relies on in an increasingly secure and sustainable way.</p>
<p>Since joining TC Energy in December 2012, Lavender has gained an in-depth knowledge of cash management and all aspects of the treasury function. In May this year she moved from treasury to a newly-created role heading up the company’s sustainable finance initiatives. She is a Chartered Professional Accountant and holds an MBA in Accounting and Finance from the University of Calgary, as well as a Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Science in Agriculture from the University of Manitoba.</p>

<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4>How did you arrive at your current role?</h4>
<p>I started my career in finance in 2004 when I joined WestJet as a business analyst, before moving to ATCO Power in 2007 as a project accountant. In 2012 I joined TC Energy as a senior analyst, at first doing energy derivatives accounting, and then after 18 months moving to a cost planning and forecasting role.</p>
<p>Following a reorganisation of the company in 2016, I joined the cash management operation and then took over as Manager in 2018. To ensure that the company can really focus on and advance its environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategies, I have recently moved to a newly created role at TC Energy: Manager of Sustainable Finance.</p>
<h4>Would you recommend having a defined career plan or being open and flexible?</h4>
<p>Having a definite plan has never worked for me. If someone asks me where I want to be in five years, the answer is – I don’t know! Five years ago, I never would have guessed I would be in my current position. So I would say, be open to all possibilities. The most important thing is to know what you like and what you don’t like. Then you can have some idea of the areas that you might like to pursue in the future.</p>
<h4>How has the conversation around inclusion and diversity evolved over the past few years?</h4>
<p>In recent years it has evolved in leaps and bounds. At a company level, it’s about measuring where we are at the moment and planning for where we would like to be in the future – TC now has concrete targets for women in leadership and on the Board, and we are making progress against those goals. For those in positions of leadership, it’s important that they check their own biases. When people are recruiting and reviewing resumes, it’s important to do this in a totally unbiased way – sometimes you have to actively check any unconscious bias you might have, to make sure that you are not discounting someone because of their name or gender.</p>
<h4>What advice would you give to women in finance in terms of establishing and developing a career?</h4>
<p>Women need to be thoughtful in their approach to building really good networks. I believe the most important thing – and something that I wish I had done sooner – is to establish good relationships, not just with immediate colleagues but with broader groups in the organisation as well.</p>
<h4>What is your motto in life or your greatest inspiration?</h4>
<p>“Have no regrets.” Also, remember that life is lived on the edge of your comfort zone. Don’t be afraid to push the boundaries of what you’re comfortable with. Rather than stay within the middle of the safe areas, push towards the edges – because that’s where the magic happens.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><h4 id="career-progression">Career progression</h4>
<p>Lavender had been working for TC Energy as a senior analyst for several years before she was asked to join the cash management operation on a temporary secondment. What began as a short-term arrangement turned into six and a half years. “It was very much the case that treasury found me,” she recalls. “It wasn’t something that I was looking to do. It certainly wasn’t on my radar as a place that I could go to, have a great career and be happy.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, she hit the ground running: shortly after Lavender joined treasury, the company acquired the Columbia Pipeline Group for US$13bn. “This was a huge project for which I was the treasury expert, becoming the de facto treasury leader of CPG until they became fully integrated,” she says. “It was during this period that I learned so much about treasury.”</p>
<p>In 2018, Lavender took over the role of Cash Management Operations Manager. A notable achievement during this time was an initiative to change the company’s main bank, which meant creating a request for proposal (RFP). “The company recognised the need to review and adjust our banking relationship. I knew it would be a lot of hard work to change, and it would be complicated, but it was a necessary thing to do,” Lavender explains. “Overseeing the whole process of selecting the new bank from start to finish was a huge undertaking. I regard it as the pinnacle of my treasury career.”</p>
<h4 id="challenging-times">Challenging times</h4>
<p>It was while Lavender was engaged on this mammoth project that the pandemic struck. “I’m an extrovert, and I thrive in interaction with people. Sitting behind a screen for two years was difficult for me,” she explains. “My leadership style is to be present and engaged. It was a challenge learning to do that remotely.”</p>
<p>After separating amicably from her husband before COVID-19 struck, she found herself having to be a single parent to her two daughters, now aged 11 and 13. “The stress of COVID, and working on a major project whilst transitioning to working from home was tough enough,” she recalls, “but added to this was the challenge of having children with changes in schooling and a reduction in their activities.”</p>
<p>During this time it was important to maintain a good team morale and to keep the lines of communication open. Staying connected with the team became not just about the work, but about the person. “To be a good leader – an authentic leader – you have to be transparent,” she cautions. “Sharing my struggles meant that others could be open about the struggles they were also having to face.”</p>
<h4 id="sharing-experiences">Sharing experiences</h4>
<p>Lavender is firm in her opinion that sharing such experiences helps towards reducing the stigma around mental health problems. “We have to be open and honest about this. Nobody is a one-dimensional being. You can be a successful person and have a great career and still struggle. A lot of people are experiencing worse mental health now than before the pandemic,” she says. “Certainly for the first time in my life I developed anxiety. Fortunately, I was able to get help from my doctor and have therapy, and it has really worked for me.”</p>
<p>She is also thankful for the support she enjoyed from her network of family and friends as well as from her colleagues. “I’m grateful that I had a job that kept me busy and happy, at a company where I have been able to talk about my experience and that has such amazing leadership,” Lavender comments.</p>
<p>Looking back at her time in treasury, Lavender believes that for women in the corporate world, it is an exciting time. “I wish more women would consider treasury as a career,” she reflects. “It can be so rewarding for people who love numbers and analytics. And it’s a great way to network with people and build relationships. I’m grateful for all the opportunities it has given me. I came out of it a better person than when I went in.”</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4>How did you get to be in your current role? What kind of career path did you have?</h4>
<p>I graduated from high school when I was 15 and went into the US Air Force when I was 17. I stayed for four years and wanted to pursue my university degrees at Long Island University, which I did all by night – including Baruch College to pursue my MBA. I did all of that while trying to simultaneously build a career – my family was poor so going to college and getting recruited onto a graduate programme wasn’t my route.</p>
<p>I started out in hospitality and was working for companies like Marriott, doing event planning and catering. From there I was recruited to work for American Express and ran their executive dining room and employee cafeteria. I was then recruited to Salomon Smith Barney, which later became Citigroup. I was working in the conference centre and I came across a women’s group that was focused on advancing women in the workplace. I was fascinated by what they were doing and asked if I could be involved.</p>
<p>I got involved in their diversity training programme, which helped me get connected to very senior women in the organisation. From that network I was able to move from the conference centre to a Client Services role in transaction banking. I took that opportunity and turned that into where I sit today – I’m now Head of Digital Channels for J.P. Morgan Payments. I think it was a combination of me raising my hand to take on complex initiatives and wanting to be involved on things outside of my role such as Diversity and Inclusion that had an impact on my career growth. I’m a huge proponent of being engaged and being involved – people will notice you if you are passionate.</p>
<h4>How did this fit with the career plans you had at the time?</h4>
<p>I realised that I could take my background in conference planning and hospitality and convert that into a career where the focus was still around finding a way to meet the needs of a client.</p>
<p>I think if you’re trying to plan out your career, the best thing is to be conscious about all the things you can bring to the table. There may be things about yourself that you do not realise – what your core competencies and innate qualities are – especially if you come from a different background than the majority of the people in your particular workplace.</p>
<h4>When you were offered a role in transaction banking, did you recognise it as an opportunity at the time? Do you think other people in your shoes would have turned it down because transaction banking didn’t feature in their ideal career path?</h4>
<p>I didn’t know what transaction banking was! My thought process was that I am here doing catering and food service management and conference centre planning at a financial institution. I thought that if I wanted to advance, I would have to leave financial services and find something that was more aligned to the expertise I thought I had. It did not occur to me that those skills were transferable. I think it’s a good idea to speak to as many people as possible to understand what value you can bring because you can’t just sit there on your own, imagining how your skills might be leveraged.</p>
<p>There are jobs that really require technical knowhow – such as lawyers and doctors – but there are so many roles that don’t need that. Many roles require different skills – such as leadership, influencing skills, communication and articulating a vision – and these are transferable skills.</p>
<h4>Do you think it’s hard to navigate the ‘power grid’ of organisations if you don’t come from a privileged background?</h4>
<p>When you come from a background where you have to put the pieces together yourself – without the privilege of having it mapped out for you by parents or other people – you can be more hesitant about putting yourself out there. You have to learn how to do it, but once you learn it you can become very skilled at it.</p>
<p>I used to be the person who sat in the class but kept quiet. But I heard so many people giving the wrong answers I realised that my thinking was relevant, and correct, and I should vocalise it – my voice was just as important. I learned not to sit back and let other people go in front; I learned that my experiences and contribution are just as valuable.</p>
<h4>How should people be approaching diversity and inclusion, and creating a speak-up culture?</h4>
<p>From my perspective, I think we all have an opportunity to make a change – no matter how junior you are – and it is everyone’s responsibility. We will not see a real impact with diversity, and with people speaking up, unless everybody does a little bit. Women need to be pushing the needle and others need to be receptive to that.</p>
<p>When it comes to diversity and inclusion, most large organisations focus on programmes to drive change, which is fine – they do help bring people together when otherwise they wouldn’t have. Many organisations have programmes where they can say they have mentored so many women or given them better opportunities. The kind of change that is needed though is more systemic and the change needs to happen from within.</p>
<h4>What about the inclusion piece – it’s one thing to have diversity, but how do you make sure everyone is included and involved?</h4>
<p>At J.P. Morgan we have the ethos that ‘I belong here’ – everyone belongs. If you feel like you belong, then you start to feel you can eat from the buffet and partake in everything that is on offer – you can access everything that is available in the organisation.</p>
<p>With speaking up it is important for the organisation to stress there will be no retaliation for doing so. Also, organisations need to make clear that inappropriate behaviour won’t be tolerated and make some examples of people early on.</p>
<p>There is a tremendous amount of discretion that goes into giving people the opportunity to speak up and actively creating an environment where there are no repercussions.</p>
<p>When something egregious happens, it is not only the person it has been done to, but the other people around who have seen it – if they were to speak up then it could be addressed without the victim having to do it.</p>
<p>Companies have to stand by what they say if they want to change behaviour – and not just take action where there is a financial or legal impact for them. The behaviour has to be ingrained from the top – the leader does not get to say one thing and do something else.</p>
<h4>Do you have a motto that you live by?</h4>
<p>My motto is ‘do to others as you would have them do to you’. That may sound cliché, but I think that is the only way we should think as human beings. If we all had that motto, imagine what life would be like if that were true all the time.</p></div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4>How did you arrive at your current role?</h4>
<p>I started my career in sales at Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance, which helped me hone my skills in sales and negotiations. Later I had a brief stint in teaching before moving back to corporate life. I joined SRF Limited in 2005 as executive assistant to the CEO, and after a couple of years I gained responsibility for strategic planning and anti-dumping litigations. I then moved to the treasury department, where I am now the group treasurer.</p>
<p>As a group treasurer, I’m responsible for enhancing stakeholder value through competitive funding, working capital innovation, trade finance optimisation, financial risk management, strategic investment, and cost reduction through technological advancements.</p>
<h4>How challenging have the last two years been?</h4>
<p>Fortunately, our company continued to do very well during the last two years despite the COVID pandemic raging throughout the world. However, it was a stressful and emotional journey on the people front, as the second wave saw the loss of many lives, and the new online world made it difficult to reach out and extend support to those who needed it.</p>
<p>The last two years gave us the opportunity to learn to deal with change. Today, change is the only constant in our lives, and we have now become more nimble and ready to embrace change. As we have taken steps to manage significant disruption, and set up mechanisms to counter various disruptions in trade, forex, liquidity, interest rates etc, we have learned to innovate and take on new and higher-level challenges.</p>
<h4>How has the conversation around inclusion and diversity evolved over the last few years?</h4>
<p>The conversation around inclusion and diversity has certainly evolved over the last few years. Today people are not only aware of it, but are also expressing views on diversity and inclusion. But the real question is – are these conversations translating to results? What is the actual impact?</p>
<p>I believe there is still a wide gap, but organisations are taking a positive step in this direction. My own organisation has embedded the diversity, equity and inclusion factors into its value system, as well as in its ESG framework. We need more and more organisations to move from treating this as a “check the box” initiative to having this embedded in the organisational culture.</p>
<h4>What advice would you give to women wishing to further their career in finance?</h4>
<p>First and foremost, don’t be afraid to go outside of your comfort zone and find a mentor for inspiration and advice. The second most important thing is networking and being seen a solution provider in the relevant circles. For this one, continuous upgradation of skill and knowledge is of paramount importance. Lastly, revisit your strategies and change course with agility. Don’t strive for perfection in one go – instead plan in detail for various scenarios backed by fallback plans for a higher success rate.</p>
<h4>What is your motto in life or your greatest inspiration?</h4>
<p>My father always encouraged me to challenge the normal using the phrase ‘Nulli Secundus’ – you are second to none. This motto reminds me to stay strong in testing times. It helps me challenge my own boundaries and rekindle hope and courage.</p></div>

<p>For Sugandha, flexibility and adapting to change are key to a successful career. Like many other treasury professionals, she did not set out with the goal of working in treasury. “I started my career in sales with Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company,” she says. “But I didn’t enjoy the sales part of the job. I decided to look for something more intellectually satisfying.”</p>
<p>After a period teaching statistics and financial management, Sugandha moved to the role of executive assistant to the CEO at SRF Limited, where she gained experience of strategic planning and anti-dumping litigation. She joined their treasury department in July 2012 and became Head of Treasury in 2020.</p>
<p>Sugandha’s advice for those looking to advance their careers is to be open and flexible – in other words, to model various scenarios rather than having a single plan based on a linear progression. “I believe the most powerful force today in finance is change,” she reflects. “Every day something new comes along. Who would have thought just a few years back that ESG would become such an important aspect of financing today?”</p>
<p>As such, she emphasises the importance of having a backup plan. “Do not be too tightly wedded to your initial ideas,” she cautions. “When new situations come along, new choices open around them. You need to be open to those choices. Because technology is continuously disruptive, any fixed strategy will become redundant at some point.”</p>
<p>For Sugandha, choosing to have a career in a field like finance is just the beginning of the story. “What exactly in finance is it that you want to do?” she asks. “Do you enjoy accounting? Or data analytics? Or trade product development? Because if you are doing something that you like, then you will do well.” Her advice for those who find themselves in positions where they are not happy is likewise clear: “If you don’t like something and you feel stuck, you should find out what it is that you do like and move to that.”</p>
<h4 id="making-changes">Making changes</h4>
<p>Sugandha’s advice for junior professionals who wish to challenge bias and promote diversity is to be aware of the bias in their behaviour. “Whether we realise it or not, our unconscious biases influence our lives in every aspect,” she adds. “If one is aware of these biases and how they are affecting our colleagues, one can start to address them.”</p>
<p>She believes it is very important for organisations to have a system in place where employees can anonymously report instances of bias. “People can recognise bias – but at times they are either afraid to confront it, or they are unsure of how to do so. Companies need to have a machinery that not only trains people on how to handle such situations but also empower them to call it out immediately,” she says. “And that system has to be anonymous.”</p>
<p>Sugandha is firmly of the belief that everything in our lives reflects our thoughts, beliefs and emotions, and that the world reflects the vibes that you put out. As such, for women on the path to making their voices heard within their organisation, there is a vital first step. “Before we even think about our voices being heard, we should value ourselves and believe in ourselves,” she says. “Women are harsh on themselves. They have high expectations of themselves and tend to believe that when things go wrong, it must be their fault. The first thing that needs to be changed is your mindset. Once you have the positive energy in you, you will see the changes around you.”</p>
<p>She cites the example of a female colleague who was unable to speak when someone else raised their voice. Once she identified the root cause, the solution was simple: “When faced with a similar situation again, she asked her colleague to keep their voice low,” explains Sugandha. “This helped her to keep calm and speak her mind.”</p>
<p>She concludes: “There are no standard solutions, but if you know the reason why you were unable to speak, you will find a solution. Identify what needs to be corrected – does the problem lie with the organisation or with you? Being able to recognise the root cause is very important, because only then can you introspect and resolve. Every situation is unique, every woman is unique and so is the solution.”</p></div>

<p>Meredith has over two decades of experience in treasury, including roles at PayPal, eBay and Royal Caribbean Cruises. In January 2017, she was appointed Senior Vice President, Treasurer at NTT DATA Services, a top ten global IT services provider. Heading up the treasury of a multibillion-dollar organisation with business operations in more than 50 countries and regions and over 30 currencies, her responsibilities include global cash management, global capital markets, and global insurance risk management.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4>Tell us about your current position.</h4>
<p>I am the Senior Vice President, Treasurer at NTT DATA Services, a large global IT services organisation, based at the company’s North American headquarters in Plano, Texas. I’ve just celebrated my five-year anniversary at the company. When I joined, the company didn’t have a fully developed treasury department – I had the opportunity to come in and build the foundation needed to transform the organisation into a robust and world-class treasury to meet the business demands of a growing organisation.</p>
<h4>How has the conversation about inclusion and diversity moved on in the last few years?</h4>
<p>Diversity and inclusion has moved beyond gender and race into deeper conversations and ways of thinking than previously. We’re now openly talking about the different thoughts, values, backgrounds and experiences that help create a diverse workplace and enhance employee morale and overall job satisfaction. As a result, we’re learning and appreciating how both our commonalities and differences come together and contribute to creating an inclusive environment – making it a priority, acting upon it and most importantly embracing it.</p>
<h4>How can junior professionals be empowered to challenge bias and promote diversity?</h4>
<p>I would say it is important for junior professionals to begin embracing diversity now by understanding their own unconscious biases to help remove barriers. I would also encourage them to join employee resource groups that exist in their organisation – but at the same time, remember that while it might be important to meet people with similar interests who can support their growth, it is equally important to develop new relationships with those who do not appear like-minded. We have several employee resource groups that are all open to any team member, whether they are a part of the community the group represents, an ally, or simply interested in learning and supporting the group.</p>
<p>I believe that the more we can learn from each other, the more we appreciate different points of view. That can only enhance team collaboration, add to job satisfaction, and promote a more inclusive environment. My advice to junior professionals would be to get involved while they are starting out in their careers, so that they can be a part of that change now.</p>
<h4>What advice would you give to women in finance in terms of establishing and developing a career?</h4>
<p>As a woman who has had her entire career in finance, I would say don’t let obstacles hold you back. Instead, navigate your way through them. There’s a workable solution if you want it badly enough. I’ve been a working mom for 16 years; I have twin daughters – it was never going to be easy to figure out!</p>
<p>It is also important to have a good support system, whether it’s your family and friends or a strong professional network, including a mentor. It’s good to talk to other people who have been there and who can help you. I certainly feel very privileged to be a mentor, both to people in the organisation and outside it. And always be confident in your abilities and promote your successes along the way.</p>
<h4>What is your motto in life?</h4>
<p>‘There is nothing more constant than change.’ It applies not only to the business world but to your personal life, to life in general. That being the case, you need to embrace it. I like change – it’s something that I thrive on. I’m always asking, ‘What’s the next challenge?’</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><h4 id="career-progression">Career progression</h4>
<p>Meredith considers herself extremely fortunate to have spent her working life in the world of treasury. Yet after gaining her MBA, she was uncertain which area of the financial world would interest her the most. “At the start of my career, we didn’t have LinkedIn,” she recalls, “nor any of the amazing online recruiting resources that we have today.”</p>
<p>Scouring the job section of the Sunday newspaper, she circled the opportunities in finance that she thought might suit her, and found an entry-level treasury analyst position for a large company in Dallas. After securing the role, Meredith quickly realised how much she loved both the treasury role itself, and the economic value that treasury drives for the organisation.</p>
<p>“From that point on, each step in my career became a thoughtful progression towards my objective of becoming a treasurer,” she says. “The desire to add a new tool to my toolbox would drive me to gain not only deeper expertise in all the various aspects of treasury, but also wider experience in a variety of different industries.”</p>
<p>As part of this progression, Meredith notes that sideways moves are sometimes important in a career. “I have made moves that weren’t necessarily an upward step in terms of title, but they presented opportunities to learn more about treasury and further enhance my leadership capabilities,” she notes. “It’s about evaluating each opportunity so that you can acquire skills to help you progress towards your goal.”</p>
<p>When Meredith joined NTT DATA in January 2017, she was able to use her extensive experience and knowledge to build a global treasury organisation, “almost from the ground up” – an exercise that has provided an opportunity to adopt highly efficient systems and processes. “In the past, just trying to understand our liquidity position around the world took a number of days,” says Meredith. “Now we can get that information in a matter of seconds.” Today, she says, her ‘small but mighty’ team has responsibilities including global cash management, financial risk management, investments, treasury M&amp;A, and global insurance risk management.</p>
<h4 id="challenging-times">Challenging times</h4>
<p>When the pandemic struck, the team was three years into implementing initiatives designed to drive efficiencies and optimise the treasury infrastructure. “We were executing upon our global liquidity strategy and treasury technology solution at the time,” Meredith recalls. “Having those solutions and technology allows us to adapt to change more quickly and thrive in the new environment.”</p>
<p>In addition, she says, the past two years have acted as a catalyst for fundamental changes in the way operations are conducted: “Adapting quickly to change, learning to be creative and working out how to do things differently has been vital.”</p>
<p>A key change has been the requirement to work remotely. “For most of my career, treasury was thought to be a function that needed to operate from an office,” comments Meredith. “But with the pandemic, we learned that wasn’t the case at all.”</p>
<p>In practice, the transition to remote working was swift. “We’ve had to be extra diligent in communicating, because we’re not physically seeing each other every day,” she says. “We make sure that we maintain connectivity with the team as well as with our internal business partners – whether it’s frequent 1:1 meetings, a weekly all-hands treasury team meeting, monthly Zoom call with our tax team to share knowledge or a quarterly touch-base with internal business sales teams.”</p>
<p>Two years on, the team is still working fully remotely. “I’m not sure when – or if – that will change,” says Meredith. “We might go to a hybrid model eventually, but I don’t think we’ll all be completely in-person again any time soon.”</p>
<p>Reflecting on why her department has been so successful, Meredith acknowledges the importance of having the right team chemistry, skillsets and vision. “We are a small team compared to the revenue that the company generates,” she explains. “But we are folks who have high respect for each other and our experiences. We share knowledge and different ideas and collaborate really well together towards our vision. It’s because we are able to leverage this amazing cohesion and talent, along with key support from leadership, that we have been able to make our vision a reality.”</p></div>

<p>Rebekah Wong is the head of Singapore Payments for J.P.

Rebekah joined the firm in 2013 as a regional Payments Product Manager and previously had a decade-long career with Citibank, where she headed operational transformation and re-engineering efforts for APAC Trade &amp; Treasury Solutions. </p>

<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4>Tell us about your current position.</h4>
<p>Having started my career with Citi in operations, I joined J.P. Morgan just over eight years ago as a regional product manager in the payments space.</p>
<p>I currently helm the Singapore payments franchise. It is very much an organisation centred on products, with responsibilities in sales and client service and implementation and delivery operations. In other words, the whole works. I also look after what we call market positioning initiatives for the region, as well as some of the more transformational aspects of the business, mission critical initiatives and projects for APAC payments.</p>
<h4>How can junior professionals be empowered to challenge bias and promote diversity?</h4>
<p>I think most of the time, junior professionals may be a little bit guarded about what they say or don’t say. My advice would be to start making a difference in your own department in your way. The more you start to challenge bias, the more comfortable you will be to continue challenging bias. Perhaps you need to find a role model, someone who has been successful in challenging bias, and try to emulate them.</p>
<p>Another way to have a voice is to join and participate in dedicated diversity and inclusion committees. In my organisation, we have quite a few of those. We want to hear more from people about what they think works and doesn’t work. That's part of the beauty of diversity, right? Junior professionals could have a very different perspective that perhaps we don't see because the way that they interact, or the things that matter to them, are different.</p>
<h4>How has the conversation around inclusion and diversity evolved?</h4>
<p>There is so much more awareness than there was ten years ago, to the extent it is even being featured on managers’ KPI scorecards. And of course it is very important to measure progress. But inclusion is incredibly difficult to measure. Someone once told me – diversity is seen, but inclusion is felt.</p>
<p>Increasingly, many organisations have dedicated committees to address these problems. The most important thing is to focus on changing the mindset. The way to start is through information and education, and then embedding some of these things in the work policy. In terms of hiring new recruits, it is important to ensure a diverse selection of not only interviewees, but also interviewers.</p>
<h4>Is it important to have a defined career plan?</h4>
<p>Although we might all like to have a defined path as much as possible, work and life don’t usually work out that way. Sometimes, due to major changes or events, we may decide to prioritise one over the other.</p>
<p>If we look at the banking industry, so much has changed, from technology all the way to consumer behaviour. So I would say that it's important to stay open and flexible. And when the right opportunity comes along, it might feel uncomfortable. But it’s OK to feel uncomfortable.</p>
<h4>What is your motto in life or your greatest inspiration?</h4>
<p>Life is a journey, not a race.</p>
<p>I also think it helps to subscribe to a very positive mindset. One of my mentors from my early days told me that no matter how hard the day is – the day will pass.</p>
<h4>Career progression</h4>
<p>One of the biggest challenges that Rebekah has faced in her career came early on, a couple of years after joining J.P. Morgan as a regional product manager. “One day I was offered the chance to become a manager in the finance and business side,” she recalls. “This was an opportunity for me to go into something very different from the positions that I had been trained in and had experience of.”</p>
<p>The new role gave her access to senior managers. “I gained a very ‘top of the house’ view on how the business is run and how it is positioned,” she says. “When I started my career, it would never have occurred to me that I would be managing the portfolio that I have now. Sometimes doors open, and you just have to go with your gut instincts. You should do your homework as well, of course. But to be challenged in different ways can be fun.”</p>
<h4>Challenging times</h4>
<p>During the time that Rebekah has been involved with cash management, she has seen the remit expand to include looking after trade and merchant services. She is a firm believer that the business she is in allows clients to be supported by their banks throughout their whole ecosystem, helping them in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>The events of the past two years have also demanded greater agility in terms of how clients are supported. For the APAC region, the storm really hit in April 2020. During the initial period of the pandemic, as clients were adapting to the new normal and working from home, working capital needs had to be met either through emergency or exceptional funding.</p>
<p>“If there was a silver lining to the cloud, it was that we were able to expedite the launch of quite a few solutions, especially digital tools,” Rebekah recalls. “I think that clients who were unwilling to consider certain digitisation initiatives in the past are now a lot more flexible.”</p>
<p>With face-to-face meetings impossible, learning new ways of connecting with clients was of the utmost importance for Rebekah and her team. “The challenge for us was how we could utilise Zoom meetings without clients becoming ‘Zoom-fatigued’. And information sharing, such as regulatory changes, had to be channelled through webinars,” she says. “It was very much a journey for all of us.”</p>
<p>Another challenge of remote working was to keep connectivity without overwhelming people by checking in all the time, and to evaluate members of the team remotely. “I would say that as a manager you need to be flexible and supportive during these difficult times and possibly recalibrate your own expectations,” Rebekah explains. “Things that came very easily in the past might now be much more difficult.”</p>
<h4>Career development</h4>
<p>When it comes to offering advice to women establishing and developing a career, Rebekah highlights the benefit of seeking out mentors, sponsors and advocates. “A mentor can help you with your overall development,” she explains. “And an advocate, or sponsor, can be there to promote your interests and open doors for you.”</p>
<p>While different women face different challenges, she emphasises the value of building confidence and asking for help and support when needed. “I also think it's important for women to stay flexible and to be open to new opportunities,” Rebekah advises. “And while it’s important to know what you want, sometimes I tell my team that it's good to know what you don’t want. We really need to be very flexible in life, because you never know what might happen next.”</p></div>

<p>With over 15 years’ experience in the banking and financial services industry, Priyanka’s areas of expertise include liquidity management, cash investments, treasury, and working capital management. During her career, she has been responsible for designing and delivering market leading cash management solutions with three leading global banks. In her current role, Priyanka leads teams across EMEA, Latin America, APAC and North America.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4>Tell us how you arrived at your current role.</h4>
<p>I grew up in India in a typical middle-class family in a small town. I always wanted to do something different, so I leaned towards STEM subjects as opposed to the humanities. I gained a mechanical engineering degree and started working in IT consulting. This was during the mid-2000s.</p>
<p>After a while I decided to do something different. I had just got married, and my husband and I both decided that we would move to France and study for our MBAs. We graduated in 2008 – during the financial crisis – but I was fortunate in securing a position at Barclays Bank. We relocated to London and started a life from scratch there.</p>
<p>The mentor I had while on the associate rotation programme at Barclays introduced me to liquidity management. When I came to the end of the programme, I applied for and got a permanent position in liquidity, and went on to gain the Certificate in International Cash Management from the Association of Corporate Treasurers. Studying for the qualification really broadened my perspective. As a banker, you can only be good if you really understand your clients, and I was in a class full of corporate treasurers who were discussing all the challenges they faced.</p>
<p>After two years I had the opportunity to join Bank of America, which was expanding its international liquidity management team. It was an exciting time – it was like working in a start-up company, but with the stability of a large bank behind you. Then, eight years ago, I joined J.P. Morgan as a liquidity client advisor. I moved into focusing on the EMEA region, and built a team from scratch. I now have teams across four regions – and every day, I continue to learn and challenge myself.</p>
<h4>How have the last two years been for you and your team?</h4>
<p>Last year was like nothing that any of us had ever anticipated, with everyone finding themselves in lockdown and having to work from home. Those who had young children and families were having to juggle so many things. Those who didn’t have families were confined to their homes, not able to interact in person with anyone. It was very emotionally draining for everyone. But we were fortunate that the technology was there to enable us to work from home. And as managers, it was important that we gave the team whatever extra help we could.</p>
<h4>What advice would you give to women in finance in terms of establishing and developing a career?</h4>
<p>Do not doubt yourself. You are worth much more than you might think you are.</p>
<p>Not everybody can do everything. But it’s not about doing everything yourself; it’s about enabling others to do things. Everyone has got their core strengths. If yours is language rather than mathematics, remember that your colleagues and clients are real people that you can relate to and communicate with. You can be the one to bring a different perspective to the table. There will always be somebody else who can crunch the numbers.</p>
<p>And choose something that you love, because that is what will drive success. One of the reasons why I throw myself into my job every day is because I’m passionate about it.</p>
<h4>Do you think it is important to have a defined career plan? Or is it more a case of being open and flexible?</h4>
<p>Having a career plan is not a bad idea – just so long as it is not too long-term, because things are constantly changing. Working out your career plan should involve asking yourself where you want to be and what you want to be doing.  Do you want to manage people, or do you want to be a strong individual contributor? Do you love solving problems inside the company, or do you prefer giving presentations to clients?</p>
<p>But also, be adaptable. Organisations change and industries change. Who would have thought 20 years ago that data science would be such a highly regarded field today? So I would say be open and flexible, and make sure that you evolve with the times.</p>
<h4>What more can women do to make their voices heard within their organisation?</h4>
<p>Speak up! The biggest obstacle that women face is their own inner critic. Before other people have a chance to box us in, we have already done that ourselves. If you believe in something, it means that you have a valid point of view. If you do face criticism, be prepared to accept it in a positive way. So be sensitive, be thoughtful and be inclusive. And allow the more junior women to be heard.</p>
<h4>What is your motto in life, or your greatest inspiration?</h4>
<p>Be the best version of yourself that you can be – it’s not just about getting a well-paid job and regular promotions. Acquire more knowledge, learn more skills and reflect on your position in the workplace, in your community and in your life. What have you done and what could you have done better? How have you contributed to making the world a better place?</p>
<h4>Inclusion and diversity</h4>
<p>With nearly two decades of experience in the financial sector, Priyanka has seen enormous changes in the industry, particularly in how inclusion and diversity have evolved. “It is now a part of our thought process every single day. That didn’t use to be the case,” she reflects.</p>
<p>However, she acknowledges that this does not necessarily apply to every workplace, and a lot of progress is still needed. “There are certain sectors where you see a general tendency for employers to hire people who look like themselves,” she comments. “We need to make a conscious effort to open that up.”</p>
<p>For Priyanka, the first area to focus on to improve inclusion is in recruitment. When it comes to choosing candidates, she believes it is necessary to look beyond degrees and immediately relevant experience.</p>
<p>“In order for the whole process to be inclusive, the range of potential candidates has to be as diverse as possible. You cannot just consider a specific category of people because you think they are the only ones with the skill set,” Priyanka comments. “If the role is in, say, liquidity and cash management – that’s something that we can teach them. So let them teach us something new. If you bring in someone different, you will get a fresh perspective.”</p>
<p>Priyanka also highlights the importance of building a sense of community. “One thing that Treasury Today does so well is the Women in Treasury initiative, where we can come together and share our experiences, our knowledge and insights,” she notes.</p>
<h4>Challenging bias</h4>
<p>When it comes to challenging bias, Priyanka is keen to stress that, rather than trying to create an agenda, the best approach is to apply common sense and seeing the value of all the small interactions that take place. “Be sensitive to other people’s emotions. Be inclusive. Don’t say things that are hurtful,” she cautions. “We teach all this to our children. But when we grow up into adults, we sometimes forget it ourselves.”</p>
<p>She is convinced that if people start to do this in the workplace, and then the wider community, it will simply become a way of life. “It’s not an initiative; it’s how we need to live,” she says. “If somebody needs to know something or wants to speak, enable them. Everybody should be able to have the floor, irrespective of their background.”</p></div>

<h4 id="could-you-outline-your-career-path-to-date">Could you outline your career path to date?</h4>
<p>I started at Citibank’s Dublin office. A few years later I left for my first foray into corporate banking, learning early lessons on the bank/corporate relationship that I still value today. A stint at Deutsche Bank followed, specialising in the advisory side and supporting my own multinational clients seeking to establish regional treasury centres. Later at J.P. Morgan, where I spent 13 years including time in Houston working in the oil and gas sector, I focused on cash management solutions, an area I love for its variety and constant evolution. I joined HSBC on the eve of the pandemic. Key focus areas have been supporting clients through the Brexit transition and navigating the impact of COVID.</p>
<h4 id="what-are-some-the-most-important-contributing-factors-to-long-term-career-success">What are some the most important contributing factors to long-term career success?</h4>
<p>Flexibility, stretching oneself and experiencing failure are all important. But learning the importance of treasury’s holistic role and understanding the wider context in which a specific task sits within a company’s strategic priorities, is perhaps the most important. Only when you understand this are you on the pulse, able to position for opportunities, know the key growth areas. We need to be more than subject matter experts.</p>
<h4 id="what-do-you-mean-by-stretching-yourself">What do you mean by stretching yourself?</h4>
<p>It’s about the need to expand beyond subject matter expertise. Success comes with doing something radical and getting out of our comfort zone. Many people shy away from applying for the difficult job, choosing instead to stick to what is in front of them. Yet we should take on the difficult assignments and volunteer for the messy tasks because this is where we learn and prove ourselves. It requires courage to give something a go and be prepared to make mistakes. But managers need people who go the extra mile beyond the day job. Treasury is a hard job made easier by a good dose of passion and conviction. You’ve got to make sure you really want it.</p>
<h4 id="why-is-failure-important">Why is failure important?</h4>
<p>As my experience has grown, so my quest for perfection has faded with an acknowledgement that answers are rarely black and white. Today there is an expectation that people should get things right first time. Yet I believe in letting colleagues take a chance, go out on a limb, and see if something works. Getting something wrong is OK, and you learn very quickly from this. It’s about giving people autonomy and confidence to try something, and support to catch them if something does go wrong.</p>
<p>If something doesn’t work first time, it doesn’t mean it won’t ever happen because ways around exist. How people deal with knock backs is, in many ways, what defines them, and is certainly the skill I value most in my own armoury. When I missed out on a promotion, I fought off the tendency to sulk and deteriorate, throwing myself into the process once again. It’s easy to become your own worst enemy, reacting negatively and not coping with rejection. I worked on the gaps so when the opportunity came around again, all things being equal, I was in a better place.</p>
<p>The process mirrors client rejections. If you put effort into pitching and don’t get it, you don’t run from the client and never talk again. You pick up and try and find the next opportunity.</p>
<h4 id="why-is-flexibility-in-a-career-plan-important">Why is flexibility in a career plan important?</h4>
<p>It’s possible to control what we put into a job, but it’s impossible to tell when the opportunities will come - or disappear. You might have a great boss who leaves the company. I’ve seen people broken by a senior leader leaving a company and the project they were working on folding. My solution is to focus on personal contributions to an organisation and not depend on rigid outcomes – which are highly unlikely given the inherent flexibility required in business success.</p>
<h4 id="what-key-issues-threaten-diversity-today">What key issues threaten diversity today?</h4>
<p>Diversity depends less on statistics and numbers and more on an organisation’s culture and inclusion, an area many companies need to do more. What roles are women in? What responsibilities do they have, and how are we listening?</p>
<p>Give people different opportunities rather than always assigning the same tasks to the same, safe, pair of hands. Give it to the outlier - this is where we need to improve inclusion. I am also increasingly concerned that improvements in ethnic diversity are not matched by better social diversity. Treasury continues to recruit from the same cohort of schools and Russell Group universities via rigid recruitment practices that ignore under-represented people lacking the same opportunities. Moreover, the pandemic will have exacerbated the inability of many to climb the social ladder because of its impact on education.  We have lost a huge chunk of society.</p>
<p>Organisations also need to do more to support mid-level professionals. It’s much easier ensuring diversity in juniors but retaining diversity mid-career is much harder. It’s no good constantly replenishing at junior levels and letting the mid-levels go. It’s in senior positions there is a limited talent pool.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4>Can you give an overview of your career so far and the lessons you have learned along the way?</h4>
<p>I have always been in banking, and I was recruited by Chase Manhattan Bank onto their graduate programme – I had first been introduced to the bank by an alumni. When I started out, I made an effort to build a professional network and took the opportunity to leverage that alumni’s connections internally at the bank. I would say that’s a key lesson: leveraging a network. It’s not just about the connections, however, you need to be able to perform and execute. Sometimes that gets lost; sometimes people think ‘I have connections, that’s all I need’, but that’s not the case. You will be judged by your body of work and whether you have delivered against your goals.</p>
<p>You also need to be able to learn and develop. Before joining HSBC, I worked at J.P. Morgan Chase for a number of years in various roles – there were some lateral moves and some career progressions. Throughout this time, I continued to learn and I was interested in developing and evolving. If you ever feel that you can do a role in your sleep, then maybe it’s time to wake up and do something different!</p>
<h4>Do you think making contacts and building a professional network has typically been done informally? Are people at a disadvantage, for example, if they don’t drink or don’t want to socialise in this way?</h4>
<p>I don’t think that has to be the case, and you can help steer meetings to whatever suits you. When I had meetings with senior people they were often breakfasts, as 7.30am was the only time they were free. I have done a lot of client entertaining in the evenings. And, at other times, I have had to make sure I could play golf, but I don’t think that happens so much now. It is much easier to suggest a coffee meeting these days as an alternative. And you can always give people options – it doesn’t have to be a drink after work.</p>
<h4>Did you set out on a particular career path or were you more flexible in how you approached it?</h4>
<p>I was offered a job! Really, that’s how it happened – it was back in the mid-1980s and jobs were not plentiful then. I had an economics major, so I was looking for a role in finance, and I decided to go into banking management. I did my research and knew that Chase Manhattan Bank was reputable – it was led by David Rockefeller – and I was honoured to be hired by them.</p>
<p>I started out in retail banking, working in the branches, and then later I became a relationship manager, which meant I had to be credit trained. And from there I went to cash management, which is where I found my niche. Career progression doesn’t have to be linear – it could be a zig zag, and I think it is important to look at the full body of work. For me having the credit training, and being a banker, has been helpful in understanding the financials when talking to clients – whether it is a chief financial officer (CFO) or a cash manager.</p>
<h4>How important is it to do something you enjoy?</h4>
<p>When I was a relationship manager, I wasn’t really enjoying it. I just felt that the best version of Dorothy was not showing up. I think a lot of people do roles where they’re not really actively engaged. For me it’s important to be challenged and to be interested in what you are doing. This doesn’t have to be professionally – I see this on a personal level as well. It applies to people at different phases of their lives, including those who have stopped working; they still need to know what to do to keep themselves challenged and stimulated. They could get a hobby, or volunteer – there are so many things people can do to keep themselves active and interested.</p>
<h4>And why do you like cash management? Why is that your niche?</h4>
<p>Everyone needs cash management! Whether it is a small business or a Fortune 100 company, cash management is the lifeblood, the payments, the flow and the working capital of an organisation – it is very much part of the CFO or treasurer’s objectives.</p>
<p>I feel like I am helping my clients thrive and develop, whether I meet them at a new facility, learn about the latest product, or visit a start-up in San Francisco. What is happening with these clients is a reflection of what is happening in the real world – outside of working hours I might hear about a new trend, and I’ll smile as I think ‘I was just talking to their owner’ or ‘I saw that when it was in the development lab’.</p>
<p>Also, working for an organisation like HSBC means that I am a global citizen. On any given day I could be speaking to someone in Hong Kong, Paris, then New York or London. It is really exciting, and the work and challenges are constantly evolving and changing.</p>
<p>I also love helping people develop in their careers and seeing how my mentoring has had an impact on the next generation of talent in this industry.</p>
<h4>With that next generation, how can you create a speak-up culture where they feel comfortable calling out bad behaviour, for example?</h4>
<p>You have to create the right environment where there is a clear understanding of what behaviour is unacceptable. Often, this starts with the tone from the top, where the senior leaders are setting the standard of desired behaviour with their words and their actions.</p>
<p>At HSBC, diversity and inclusion, and the people agenda, are integral to our success, so this is so important. There are things you can do about making sure issues are raised. At HSBC, for example, there is a dedicated confidential line that people can call. People can speak to their line manager, or another colleague. If I hear of anything that might have happened, I have an obligation to make sure that it gets reported, either to human resources (HR) or the confidential line.</p>
<p>One positive change I’ve noticed in recent years is that people are more likely to speak up when things aren’t right. Also, public opinion is changing – with the #MeToo movement, for example – so people feel more comfortable talking about it. To the next generation coming into this industry – and to everyone else – I tell them, ‘If you see something, say something’.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Treasury Today’s Women in Treasury US Forum took place on 17<sup>th</sup> November as a digital event. Hosted by Sophie Jackson, Treasury Today’s Publisher &amp; Head of Strategic Content and Meg Coates, Publisher &amp; Head of Operations, a panel of experts from the treasury and banking community discussed a range of important topics, including representation and visibility, the complexities of intersectionality, and the value of building communities. The panel included:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Danette Le, Vice President and Assistant Treasurer, Corporate Finance, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Karina Inga-Kamienski, Senior Director, Capital Markets, Gilead Sciences, Inc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phung Ngo-Burns, Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer, NexTier Completion Solutions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dorothy Musho, Executive Vice President, Head of Commercial Banking Sales, Global Liquidity &amp; Cash Management, HSBC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lisa Davis, Global Head of Digital Channels, J.P. Morgan Wholesale Payments</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="routes-to-success">Routes to success</h4>
<p>The panellists gave an overview of their career paths to date. Phung explained that she comes from an immigrant family – “We came to the United States in the 1970s” – and that mentoring has been a recurring theme in her career ever since high school. She added that much of the value of working with a mentor has come from being open minded about suggestions from people who are interested in her progress.</p>
<p>“The question, ‘Have you ever thought of…?’ is one that has resonated with me throughout my career – from ‘Have you thought of accounting?’ to ‘Have you thought of joining the aviation industry?’ to ‘Have you thought about getting your MBA?’” said Phung. She added that as a result of benefiting from the encouragement of many mentors along her career journey, she is now keen to be a mentor herself.</p>
<p>Lisa, meanwhile, spoke about her childhood in Brooklyn as the only girl in a family with five brothers. Without the means to go to college, she joined the United States Air Force and later attended night classes and worked in hospitality before making the move into banking. “What I said in the job interview was that at the end of the day we’re serving clients’ needs – whether it’s serving them a bowl of soup, or serving up a bank account,” she recalled. “We all have to learn how to service our customers, and we all have to learn what that means in the particular industry that we’re in.” Lisa subsequently spent 22 years at Citi before moving to J.P. Morgan.</p>
<p>Dorothy talked about her early sporting ability, and the insights she gained about the importance of teamwork. “I played sports all through high school and college, and I think that helped me when I first entered the workforce,” she said. “I was always in banking – I started with Chase Manhattan Bank – and my skillset helped me get those initial roles. People would ask during the recruiting process, ‘You were part of a team – tell me about that.’”</p>
<p>Turning to the value of mentorship, she reflected that many people have had mentors without necessarily regarding them in that way – and that some of her most valuable mentors have been men. Today, she added, one of her most important activities is to have Zoom meetings with people who are about to graduate and want to know what they should be thinking about. “The best part of being able to sit at a forum like this is to talk about that, influence other ideas, and help others along the way,” she said.</p>
<h4 id="building-communities">Building communities</h4>
<p>Danette described the work she has done in setting up the Women’s Inspirational Network at Host Hotels &amp; Resorts. With the planned launch event delayed by the beginning of the pandemic, it became clear that a change in direction was needed: “We realised we needed to pivot, because our female colleagues really needed us, and we needed to provide that supportive community.” Following a virtual launch, 2021 has seen numerous developments, from a virtual fireside chat with some newer female leaders of the company to virtual community service events. “We wanted to ensure that throughout the year, whether virtual or in person, we continue to have regular cadence of communication with our members,” Danette added.</p>
<p>Karina, meanwhile, explained that she had been looking for an organisation that would help build strong connections with other women in finance and treasury – “and I didn’t find one – so the idea came up about creating one.” She began speaking to women she knew to gauge interest in the idea, and found considerable support. “Three years later, Women in Treasury in the San Francisco Bay area is still going strong,” she said. “It’s a venue where we can build connections, support each other with career advancement, and inspire the next generation of women.” Following a recent career panel for young, female finance students, the group is now also helping to build mentorship relationships.</p>
<p>Alongside this community, Karina has also created a Latinas in Finance and Treasury circle. “I love this circle, because it brings that intersectionality between being a woman, being Latina, and being in a field where we’re not very much represented,” she comments. “So our focus is to increase representation, share and learn from each other, support our growth in our careers – and bring more Latinas to the table.” She explained that while this type of initiative does take considerable energy and dedication, “there’s power in building that community.”</p>

<blockquote><p>“It is inspiring to be part of this community of women who are passionate about growing their careers, mentoring the younger generation for success and bringing women together to ensure we continue to have a voice in this industry.”</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4 id="representation-and-visibility">Representation and visibility</h4>
<p>The conversation turned to the importance of visibility and representation. Phung noted that visibility is more important than ever, and that it plays a critical part in “getting everyone to be able to share their story, and to help you to know that you are never alone in your journey.” She explained that meeting individuals with a similar background to hers has helped her to understand where her aspirations come from.</p>
<p>Returning to intersectionality, Lisa observed that the community she goes home to is very different to the community she works with, and that being a black woman in banking and finance is much rarer than simply being a woman in banking and finance. “Diversity comes in so many colours and so many facets – it gets down to what you believe, and religion, and being LGBTQ, and all these other facets of our lives,” she continued. “If we could figure out a way to bring all of that into the pot, I think we’d find we’re only tapping a little bit of how to make every individual feel like they belong.”</p>
<h4 id="achievements-so-far">Achievements so far</h4>
<p>Sophie asked the panel about the progress that has happened so far. Dorothy said that people are becoming more comfortable about having this type of conversation and asking questions. “The Covid environment has helped that,” she commented. “Look at this – we’ve brought together people that wouldn’t have been in New York; we’ve opened this up to an audience that would not have been able to participate in the past.” But as she also pointed out, another outcome of the pandemic is that a significant number of women have left the workforce.</p>
<p>Danette noted that the US is one of the only wealthy countries that doesn’t offer parental leave at a national level – “But the good thing is that individual companies are improving what they’re offering for their employees. Having time to adjust to the new reality of being a working mom is really important.” Likewise, she said that the flexibility that has arisen during the pandemic in terms of being able to work from home or adjust working hours to accommodate childcare “has been an important and positive shift.”</p>
<p>For Karina, understanding the power of community is another important development. “What I’ve learned is that people really appreciate being part of a community, and the sense of belonging,” she explained. “If you don’t see something offered in your community, then go create it and surround yourself with people that are like minded and positive.”</p>
<h4 id="the-great-resignation">The Great Resignation</h4>
<p>One trend that companies have experienced this year is the ‘Great Resignation’ – in other words, a spike in employees quitting their jobs. In the US, for example, 3% of the workforce left their jobs in September alone. Against this backdrop, Sophie asked the panel about the challenges women may face when moving to a new organisation.</p>
<p>Dorothy noted that HSBC has a people committee that provides help not only with signing up for the right systems, but also with introducing new starters to the resources they may need professionally and personally. “In the first 30 days, that means making sure they’re being introduced to the right group of individuals across the organisation, as well as finding out their interests and helping them understand the culture,” she added.</p>
<p>Looking forward, Danette emphasised the importance of avoiding complacency. “Think outside the box and take risks, because that’s how you’re going to grow,” she concluded. “Clearly this has been a long journey for all of us in terms of gender equality, DE&amp;I; – and it’s going to continue. As long as we are never complacent, we will make progress.”</p></div>

<p>On 16<sup>th</sup> September, Treasury Today’s Women in Treasury EMEA Forum took place as a digital event. Sophie Jackson, Treasury Today’s Publisher &amp; Head of Strategic Content and Meg Coates, Publisher &amp; Head of Operations, hosted an informative discussion about navigating a successful career, remote working and the importance of community. They were joined by four expert panellists:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Kemi Bolarin, Head of Treasury Europe, GXO Logistics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yang Xu, Senior Vice President, Global Treasurer &amp; Corporate Development, Kraft Heinz</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cara Savas, European Regional Head of Sales for Global Banking Clients, Global Liquidity and Cash Management, HSBC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Priyanka Rath, Head of Global Liquidity Product Solutions Specialists, Treasury Services, J.P. Morgan</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="mapping-out-a-career-path">Mapping out a career path</h4>
<p>The panellists shared the different journeys that had brought them to their current roles, and the decisions they had made along the way.</p>
<p>Priyanka explained that having been born and raised in India, she initially pursued mechanical engineering, before realising it was not right for her. An IT role at Oracle Financial Services brought the opportunity for extensive travel. Then, after getting married, she and her husband decided they would both pursue an MBA in France. “The MBA experience opened up my mind – it enabled me to switch industry and work for a bank,” Priyanka reflected. “I found that pitching to treasurers and CFOs was my calling – I absolutely love being in liquidity and working with talented colleagues and people across the industry.”</p>
<p>Yang said she was raised in a small town in China before a scholarship took her to study in Europe. After initially starting in treasury and deciding to pursue a more general finance path, she spent a number of years working in finance roles before joining Kraft Heinz as Global Treasurer. More recently, a promotion led her to move from Chicago to the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Cara, meanwhile, described her upbringing in the west of Ireland as the youngest of seven children, and the route that took her to a career in international banking. “It was a real time of change in treasury in the 1990s, with the euro, treasury centres and tech centres,” she recalled. Following a gap in which she focused on childcare responsibilities, Cara joined HSBC, and sees her current role as a culmination of all her international experience.</p>
<p>And Kemi explained how after qualifying as a chartered accountant, she was introduced to treasury in her internship year, and was drawn to the variety and diversity of the role. Kemi previously changed roles during the 2008 financial crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic once again brought some major career decisions: after leaving her previous role after 12 years, she had planned to do some consultancy – but on her last day she was offered a role setting up a new treasury department for a spin-off company, and was subsequently recruited to her current role at GXO Logistics. “The quiet period that lockdown gave to me served as a boost in confidence,” Kemi reflected.</p>
<h4 id="making-the-right-moves">Making the right moves</h4>
<p>With some questions from the audience focusing on the challenges involved in moving between different disciplines, the delegates shared their views on the benefits that such a move can bring. For treasury professionals looking to move into banking, Cara observed that “treasury experience is priceless in banks – we’re always trying to understand the client mindset. So don’t think of it as a disadvantage, and use your network of bankers to help you make that bridge.”</p>
<p>Priyanka added that a useful approach is for candidates to tailor their CVs to the requirements of different roles and highlight the skills and experience that are most relevant. “So if you’re applying for a banking position, elevate your CV to address what you can do to leverage your corporate treasury experience to make it work in banking, versus what you’ve done in the past.”</p>
<p>Kemi noted the value of taking steps to appear more robust and therefore appeal more broadly to future employers. She added that she had attended many courses on LinkedIn Learning to develop new skills.</p>
<p>And in response to a question about moving from financial reporting into treasury, Yang said that in her company, people often call her for a virtual coffee chat because they are curious about treasury. “Having a genuine understanding and interest in treasury is a huge plus,” she commented. While moving to treasury might be easier within the current organisation, she noted that a general finance background, such as FP&amp;A;, can certainly be beneficial for a treasury role, particularly in light of the growing focus on working as a business partner.</p>
<h4 id="the-value-of-community-and-mentorship">The value of community and mentorship</h4>
<p>Turning to the importance of community spaces, Priyanka noted that “When we create a community, we create a sense of belonging – it’s laying the foundation for many generations to come. That’s imperative because it means women looking up and seeing so many accomplished women treasurers will think, ‘If they can do it, so can I.’” She reflected that a strong community can bring many benefits, such as sharing wisdom through discussions, and helping women access tailored treasury courses that can help them in their careers by adding to their skillsets.</p>
<p>“It’s absolutely imperative to bring together like-minded individuals who genuinely want to help and benefit from each other’s experience, advice and wisdom,” Priyanka added. “We have a few established initiatives within J.P. Morgan that I’m a senior sponsor on, and I’m passionate about enabling upcoming talent within the firm and beyond.”</p>
<p>Kemi said that she realised during the pandemic that she had neglected professional networking for many years – but the rise of virtual networking has taken off the pressure involved in arranging physical meetings and enabled her to expand her network.</p>
<p>The speakers also discussed the need to balance time given to the community with their other responsibilities. As Yang noted, “We often get lost in the mist of giving” – but equally, she reflected that she had reached her current position as a result of good advice and support from the community. By sharing something that resonates, she said, it is possible to “change the trajectory of someone’s professional and personal life.”</p>
<p>Moving to the topic of mentorship, Cara argued it was important to understand the difference between a mentor and a sponsor, adding that women are often “over mentored and under sponsored.” She explained that whereas a mentor is anyone who can give you advice on anything, a sponsor is much more specific – namely “someone senior who can help you and use their personal clout to advocate for you.”</p>
<p>As Sophie explained, Treasury Today’s new interactive Within hub will provide an opportunity for people to indicate their interest in a mentoring arrangement. The hub, which will be launched imminently, will also include resources, videos and a chat room.</p>

<blockquote><p>As sponsor of the Women in Treasury Study, we are proud to be a key part of the community Treasury Today has created for women in the treasury industry – especially during the past 18 months, when support for each other from that community was both essential and tangible. We encourage you to continue to challenge the status quo by taking the lead in promoting conversations around diversity and female progression within your company and acting as a role model for those women coming up behind you.</p></blockquote>

<h4 id="lessons-from-the-pandemic">Lessons from the pandemic</h4>
<p>The speakers discussed the impact that the switch to hybrid working models post-pandemic will have on gender equality.</p>
<p>Yang said that her company intends to adopt a hybrid working model for the future, with people expected to come into the office several days a week, but not for the whole week. “There’s been a lot of debate and reflection on why this is necessary and how this helps, or hurts, certain populations,” she said. Moving forward, she added, the focus was expected to be on seeing the workplace as somewhere people can interact and collaborate – in contrast to the five days a week approach of the past.</p>
<p>In terms of the impact on gender equality, Cara observed that the people who have historically had to leave work early to collect children have tended to be female – but that the rise of hybrid working could offer an opportunity for more balance. “My hope is that if everyone is in the office less, that burden will by default be shared more,” she said. “It’s the chance of a lifetime for us now to get it balanced out.”</p>
<p>Turning to the important topic of mental health, Priyanka said the challenges of the last 18 months have brought people back in touch with their most human side. “This has been a tough year – people have missed out on family events and have not been able to say their final goodbyes to loved ones. I think it takes us back to the basics of checking in on everyone – and if you notice something is not right, offering an extra helping hand.” Equally, she said, it is important to have some time for yourself – “you can’t pour from an empty cup.”</p>
<h4 id="representation-and-risk-taking">Representation and risk taking</h4>
<p>Turning to the importance of representation, Kemi spoke about her experience of returning to the UK from Nigeria in the 1990s, and the importance for everyone to have stories, characters and images they can relate to. When it comes to being an active agent of progress, she noted the need to “step up and be seen, and show people now and in the future that there’s somebody like you in this profession.”</p>
<p>Also important is allyship. “It’s about collaborative effort. It’s about working towards a common goal,” said Kemi. “And it’s about building a truly global community – one that is intersectional, inclusive, and representative of every aspect, every race, every gender and every culture within the community.”</p>
<p>Finally, the panellists spoke about how to embrace risk taking while building a career. Cara said she is less afraid of failing now than she was when she used to be. She added, “Your inventory of skills is what makes you. What you’ve done in particular roles has helped you with that – but it’s yours, and if you leave a company or go into a different industry, you still have it. So the risk is not as big as it looks sometimes.”</p>

<h4 id="tell-me-how-you-got-your-current-position">Tell me how you got to your current position.</h4>
<p>I graduated from Northeastern University in 2015 located in Boston, Massachusetts where I studied international business with a concentration in finance and a minor in Spanish. As part of that programme I had three co-op placements for six months each – cooperative educational experiences where you get full-time work as part of your degree programme. The third co-op I went on was with State Street Global Advisors where I worked on the strategy team as a Fixed Income Portfolio Specialist Co-op. It was a wonderful opportunity because I was still studying at Northeastern, yet was able to have this real world experience in what would ultimately become my career. My co-op experience eventually turned into a full-time role as a Fixed Income Specialist at State Street Global Advisors. During my time on the team, I met some incredible colleagues who became cherished mentors, and really opened my eyes to the complex and dynamic world that is fixed income, and I absolutely fell in love with it.</p>
<p>Following my time on the Strategy team, I was hired onto the global cash team as a Portfolio Manager and Trader on the Government side (US Treasuries and Agencies). I have been on the team for about two and a half years now and it has been a very rewarding experience. I have made some valuable connections and have really been able to sink my teeth into the fundamentals of cash, which are truly the building blocks of most financial markets.</p>
<h4 id="how-have-you-seen-the-conversation-that-we-are-having-around-inclusion-and-diversity-evolve">How have you seen the conversation that we are having around inclusion and diversity evolve?</h4>
<p>From where I sit, I think there is increasingly more awareness around diversity and inclusion in the workplace, and consequently safe spaces to have these conversations. Personally, if I am in a group setting and a comment arises that could be interpreted as being biased, I feel more comfortable speaking up and saying something. There continues to be more acceptance and awareness around the topic, which is essential in creating a foundation for these conversations; conversations of which we need to continue to have.</p>
<h4 id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-women-in-finance-in-terms-of-establishing-and-developing-a-career">What advice would you give to women in finance in terms of establishing and developing a career?</h4>
<p>I volunteer with my alma mater – Northeastern – with their Women in Finance group, and am frequently asked what classes the students should be taking or publications they should be reading in order to be more prepared to move over to the portfolio management side of the business.  I like to remind students that upon graduation, the most valuable skills you can offer to an employer are more soft skills, such as attention to detail and enthusiasm. My experience has been that once you show an employer or colleague that they can rely on and trust you, they will be more than happy to take the time to train you and teach you the hard skills you need to be successful on the job.</p>
<p>For example, if someone comes to you with a task, they have to know that you will complete it effectively, correctly and with humility. By humility I mean, having the confidence to ask the right questions and admit when you need additional clarification. Once you’ve created that trust, the level of responsibility continues to increase, as does the time colleagues spend with you, teaching and training you. You want to be someone who is worth their investment from a time perspective, so it is on you to show them how you can add value. As you continue to create that trust, more and more opportunities will open up.</p>
<h4 id="what-more-can-women-do-to-make-their-voices-heard-within-their-organisation">What more can women do to make their voices heard within their organisation?</h4>
<p>For me personally, in order to feel that my voice is heard, or to have more confidence in speaking up, I think it is important to create a community of people that you trust, both internal and external to the workplace. It is important to have safe places to have honest and thoughtful conversations and to get different perspectives and opinions that offer a more balanced approach. You then get to see different management styles, leadership styles, learning styles, and personalities. This is something I have focused on so that I don’t get siloed into one thought process. From having these varying perspectives and experiences, I can then see what I personally want to incorporate into my career and working style, by taking what resonates with me the most.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-your-motto-in-life-or-your-greatest-inspiration">What is your motto in life, or your greatest inspiration?</h4>
<p>This is probably a common response to this question, but my greatest inspiration is my mother, who I have a very close relationship with. Any time she has faced a challenge or any kind of adversity in her life, she has taught herself to view that challenge as an opportunity.</p>
<p>There have been multiple occasions when she truly has reinvented herself. In her 40’s she went to medical school to become a Physician Assistant, of which she was for over a decade. Later, she came out of retirement to become a flight attendant because she wanted to travel the world. As she sees it, any time one door closes, she is absolutely convinced that that door was not meant for you, and that an even better one will open. She has taught me that you can be many things in this life, as long as you set your mind to it and keep moving forward. When my mother wakes up in the morning, she genuinely thinks each and every day is going to be a rewarding and fulfilling day. And if my mother is ever not satisfied, she will be proactive, advocate for herself, and make a change – she works at and chooses to be happy and present every day. I think we all can admire that determination.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4>Tell me how you got to your current position.</h4>
<p>My professional career started after my 16th birthday at RBS [Royal Bank of Scotland] in the machine room, where the cheques were processed. We would handle the cheques as they came in, and if there was a spelling mistake on your statement that would have been my fault! We would input the cheques, batch them all up and then post them to the Bank of England. We used to share a computer between four of us! That was 1987.</p>
<p>I worked through the RBS machine room and moved on to being a cashier, and then working on opening corporate bank accounts, corporate loans and corporate advances. I became the Chief Cashier of the RBS branch in Jersey, counting money and dealing with clients. From there, I moved into a role where I was assisting a new Head of Treasury with crunching numbers, updating spreadsheets and the like when they offered me a role to stay as FX trading assistant and later, I moved on to selling vanilla and structured deposits.</p>
<p>I then decided to move to London. I moved in 2007 to be the Business Development Manager for RBS Financial Markets’ short-term markets desk and I was tasked with increasing client deposits.</p>
<p>We went to hell and back in 2008 and 2009 during the global financial crisis. That’s when people realised that cash is the most important thing on the bank’s balance sheet – if you don’t have that you don’t have a bank. Cash moved from being the poor cousin to being front and centre. It was an exciting time, but at the time it was scary as hell.</p>
<p>After taking maternity leave, I came back to RBS and then six months later I was made redundant. The redundancy made me reflect on my banking career and pushed me to do what I wanted to do – it forced me to make the leap. I took a few months out, and I was not even going to look for another job as I didn’t know if I really wanted to go back into banking, I decided it was and then a role came up at State Street Global Advisors in cash sales, and in January 2019 I joined as the Corporate Salesperson. It has been a challenge – often cold calling but what has always helped me In the face of challenges – your team. It is really important to have a team that supports you, people you can vent with, people who let you get it out so you can process it and move on.</p>
<h4>How have you seen the conversation that we are having around inclusion and diversity evolve?</h4>
<p>In my time it has changed drastically because people talk about it now. For many years, say 20 years ago, it would have never been discussed. It was almost a silent thought that ‘it is the boys who always get the good jobs’ – it’s almost how you were brought up. To be able to talk about it is the biggest step – it is not taboo anymore. And to be able to call people out on it is also a big step. In the past, if you made any kind of comment, it would be frowned upon. In fact, it would be sheer shock and horror. More people are empowered to speak out because they see more people doing it. It feels like those who are not as confident feel like they can do it because they see the likes of me talking about it, and if necessary, calling it out, and having no repercussions for calling it out.</p>
<h4>What advice would you give to women in finance in terms of establishing and developing a career?</h4>
<p>Build a network through your life and career from the very beginning with people you want to be associated with and who inspire you. Find people who will give you that confidence you may need sometimes and keep them, have that network of people that will help you through your career. They should be able to help in different ways: some may be able to help in a holistic way, others may help specifically with guidance on your career. Have your sounding board, your confidantes, for when you are frustrated with something. They can help you reason; they will be the people who advise you to write that email but not to send it until the next day when you have had a chance to think about it – you need those sorts of people in your life.</p>
<h4>Do you think it is important to have a defined career plan or is it more a case of being open and flexible?</h4>
<p>I believe you have to have a mix. You have to have a goal – you may call that a defined career plan – but you have to be open and flexible on how you get there. But never lose sight of what your goal actually is.</p>
<p>My goals changed early on in my career. Now in this part of my career I am actually where I want to be – I am happy where I am and what I have achieved. My goal now is to pass that knowledge onto people who are coming into the industry who will never have the experience I have of working through the whole system. I want to help them have the confidence to take the steps they need to, and I want to make things better for those coming into the industry.</p>
<h4>What is your motto in life, or your greatest inspiration?</h4>
<p>My motto in life is to be a little bit scared every day because that means you are challenging yourself. In the workplace you need something that keeps the adrenaline going, but also you need to know at the same time that you can do it. It could be something as simple as picking up the phone and speaking to someone you have never spoken to.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Last month, Treasury Today brought together our community across Asia for an annual celebration of women in treasury to share stories and advice for success in the industry. Attendees joined Sophie Jackson, Treasury Today’s Publisher &amp; Head of Strategic Content and Meg Coates, Publisher &amp; Head of Operations, alongside expert panellists Stephen Hogan, Vice President Regional Treasury, Deutsche Post DHL, Deborah Ho, Regional Head of the South East Asia Business and Country Head Singapore, BlackRock and Rebekah Wong, Head of Singapore Wholesale Payments and Head of APAC Market Management &amp; Strategic Execution for Wholesale Payments, J.P. Morgan.</p>
<h4 id="early-journey">Early journey</h4>
<p>Deborah began the conversation, reflecting on her own career progression and stressed the importance of being ready to seize opportunities when they arise. This is only possible, she said, by “knowing what you are looking for.” For her, this came with the sudden realisation that she wanted to be back on the buy-side. After spending her early years in sales and trading at J.P. Morgan, plus stints in asset management and investment banking, she knew she was working in the wrong area of finance. So, when BlackRock came knocking with an opportunity that fitted this new aspiration it was “like a dream come true.” She also counselled women on the importance of being visible within a company and being willing to take risks.</p>
<p>Stephen’s first job was as a civil servant. Later, working in the UK’s NHS, he was responsible for managing the hospitals’ huge cash deposits, piquing his interest in treasury, cash flows and liquidity. Next, he sidestepped into the private sector, joining DHL in London, and working on early projects like hub financing and aircraft acquisition. A life changing opportunity came later when the company asked him to work firstly in Brussels and then after 2 years Singapore. “They asked me if I would go to Singapore for a year; 18 years on I’m still here.”</p>
<p>Rebekah began her career at Citi as a junior cash operations officer. She deliberately opted for operations because of its focus on technology and transformational projects. When J.P. Morgan offered her the chance to work in product management, she saw it as a natural next step. “I took the plunge eight years ago and am now managing wholesale payments in Singapore,” she said.</p>
<p>Her comments led Tricia Ho-Hudson, Group Treasurer, Woolworths Group, to reflect on the fact that treasury is a profession particularly suited to women leaders. “The mix of technical skills and interpersonal skills is right up women’s alleys,” she said, adding. “Women in Treasury helps to emphasise this as a professional option and to create a supportive network amongst female and male colleagues.”</p>
<p>In a revealing insight, Deborah told delegates how she credits much of her resilience and determination in her career to her early childhood in Singapore. Both her parents worked, leaving her and her siblings in the care of an inspiring Cantonese nanny. Saving and earning money to support her own family back home in China, her work ethic and self-reliance without any male support left a long-lasting impression on her young charge. “My nanny made us watch the news because she knew how important it is to grow your greatest asset; and there we learnt about the price of gold, property and stock markets,” Deborah recalled. Later, her all-girls school further embedded the importance of self-reliance and determination to work hard, she said.</p>
<h4 id="be-international">Be international</h4>
<p>Next the conversation turned to moving and settling in new locations.</p>
<p>Drawing on his own experience of living in Brussels and Singapore, Stephen said moving location is both exciting and worrying. Worrying elements for him included leaving a large family network in London, but he said he soon grew comfortable with the long journey home – and found that loved ones would come and stay. He said although DHL’s human resources department offered extensive support around local accommodation and travel, he also had to learn to survive on his own and build a team – his Germany based boss empowering him to take responsibility for all issues and only expected to hear from him “when something was wrong.” Still, it was a life-changing opportunity. “The best thing I ever did was get out of my comfort zone and build a life from scratch. It has given me a more inclusive mind set.”</p>
<p>As for inspiration, Rebekah cited J.P. Morgan boss Jamie Dimon. She said the culture he endorses at the bank cascades right through the business and includes instilling staff with the courage to take chances and innovate. Her early career also taught her the importance of collaboration with colleagues in other departments.</p>
<p>Rebekah added that moving to a new location increases visibility within a firm. Living overseas allows people to get to know colleagues in other parts of the business, gaining exposure outside their own departments and country. Although she countered that people who “wanted to stay in one location” wouldn’t miss out, she said that international exposure allowed people to test their own abilities and risk appetite. Working abroad also offers a window into other cultures. Recalling an attachment to a transformation project in Zurich early in her career, she said the experience still informs her decision making today. “An ability to embrace different working cultures is important,” she said.</p>
<h4 id="pandemic-impact">Pandemic impact</h4>
<p>Next the conversation turned to progress in gender equality, particularly the impact of the pandemic on female career progression. In what Deborah called “hard numbers” echoed “across regions”, she said the pandemic threatened to set back a whole generation and urged companies to offer more support to working women struggling to balance home life and make themselves visible. A point echoed by our event supporter, BNP Paribas’ Sofia Hammoucha, Head of Transaction Banking, Southeast Asia, who says, “Given how the female gender has been disproportionately hit by this pandemic, we need to come together and be even more focused on ensuring women’s progress in the workplace.”</p>
<p>Stephen stressed the importance of genuine male empathy of the importance of gender equality. He said his proactivity on gender equality, rooted in his childhood growing up with four older sisters, is now driven by his ambition for equality for his nieces, and the success of his all-female team. He noted that although finance attracts women, many of the senior roles are dominated by men. “They’ve taken risks because they can; they have been able to move up,” he said. As for inspiring leaders, one of his heroes is DPDHL’s CFO Melanie Kreis, who heads up a 10,000-strong global finance organisation and is a diversity statement for the group as a whole. “She is inspiring,” he said.</p>
<p>Rebekah also picked up on the importance of male leaders acknowledging a need for equality. Men have a vital role in creating the right kind of culture, she said. Deborah called for men to join the path to equality by putting it in the context of the women in their life. This way it becomes a cause we can all believe and share in, she said. She also stressed the importance of women’s networks with both female and male leaders and said that interview panels needed to be culturally diverse.</p>
<p>Stephen added that diversity involved understanding that the person who shouts loudest is “not the best.” He said leaders needed to understand that some women are reticent about going after job opportunities and cited the importance of encouraging people to explore different ways to get themselves noticed as well as the need for career advice on banking and treasury roles in schools. Stephen said that most men believe in gender equality but need to be empowered to drive and support the agenda. It involves creating awareness and he urged companies to publish diversity statements. As for ensuring diversity in recruitment practices, he said it was important not to look for “experts” but find people with a “good broad grounding” and that people can learn stuff on the job. He seeks to hire people with an ability to engage and come up with solutions to problems. You can go into treasury with broad skills, he said.</p>
<p>Elsewhere the panellists touched on the importance of diversity being viewed through a broad ESG lens, arguing that acting on diversity is part and parcel of companies fulfilling their social license to operate. Tricia added that in her recent experience the Chairs and Directors of the Board have become key treasury supporters. “They recognise the important role that treasury plays in ensuring the strength of the balance sheet.  They recognise this not just when there is a liquidity crisis created by COVID but in our everyday activities and they thank us when we do a good job.”</p>
<h4 id="last-advice">Last advice</h4>
<p>In a last piece of advice, Deborah said she wished she’d been braver in her career and pushed herself out of her comfort zone. Despite moving to New York for five years she said she regretted not exploring more different roles within the firm. “I was selling European bonds to real money managers in the US and when they asked if I wanted to join the emerging market desk, I passed on the opportunity and clung to what I knew,” she recalled.</p>
<p>Rebekah said her regret was being too critical of herself.  “Over the years I’ve learnt to be kinder to myself,” she said. “I tell my team that it’s ok to make a decision that doesn’t work out.” For Stephen, a key regret is not taking more risk. “If it fails it fails, you pick up and carry on,” he said.</p>
<p>Panellists concluded that career goals change over time and are always influenced by “where you are at that moment.” They reflected on how we always seek to be comfortable in our own skin, but that it is also good to be a little uncomfortable. Speak up, be international, get involved, ask for help and find allies to help and mentor you, they advised. Furthermore, align yourself with a firm and remember that people will only follow your lead if they understand what is in it for them. Above all, treasury is an industry aligned with the future, they concluded.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><h4 id="why-does-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-matter-to-you">Why does diversity, equity and inclusion matter to you?</h4>
<p>Diversity, equity and inclusion matters deeply to me as it represents real life, and our work should reflect that. I work on the basis that everyone has something to say, something to offer, something to learn and something to teach. I’ve seen so often how magic happens when you invest time in people, a conversation, some advice or in our case, some coaching and training. There is a fine line between those who get to participate and those who miss out, and I’m on a mission to show people how to step over that line. The fastest way we can make a difference to the diversity we see in organisations, is to ensure equity and inclusion is fair and representative of the communities we serve. Leaders need to be selected and trained for different qualities these days. It’s no longer appropriate to promote people into leadership roles who are simply the most senior, most successful or the best self-promoter. If we continue to do that we will lack diversity, as women and marginalised individuals are not obvious choices.</p>
<p>Removing the imaginary fine line, opening up opportunities for people to realise their potential and seeing beyond the obvious candidates is the way forward, in my opinion.</p>
<h4 id="how-have-you-interacted-with-corporate-leaders-and-how-have-you-seen-approaches-to-work-life-and-diversity-change-over-the-past-decade-or-more">How have you interacted with corporate leaders and how have you seen approaches to work, life and diversity change over the past decade or more?</h4>
<p>I interact with corporate leaders every day and I think more has changed in the last 18 months, than had changed in the previous decade. COVID-19 has impacted everyone, and we’ve seen a snapshot of what the world needs, presented very clearly to us all. Organisations who have looked after their people, kept them feeling psychologically safe, connected and engaged, are the organisations that people will gravitate to in the future. Flexibility, understanding, empathy, care, and concern – these qualities should not just be a response to a pandemic, but they need to be key features in the future of work. I don’t know anyone who hasn’t considered their own career, the meaning they find in it, the impact they create from it and how it relates to their life and family, in the last 18 months. As a result, we have seen many people change careers, step back from something too demanding or move towards something more meaningful. I do think many women have stepped away from their role because it doesn’t suit their holistic view of their life and what is clearly important. That is not to say women are not capable of moving into the future of work. Many are looking for a different solution to the one they were putting up with prior to COVID-19. Now is the time for more organisations to engage women and diverse groups, with an offer of flexibility, respect and openness to new ideas. Then we will start to see a fully engaged workforce, with options to suit many situations, roles and responsibilities.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-unique-to-the-australian-corporate-landscape-and-what-would-you-like-to-see-change">What is unique to the Australian corporate landscape and what would you like to see change?</h4>
<p>We’ve been fortunate in Australia, being an island, we’ve been able to protect ourselves from COVID-19 to a large degree, by closing our borders and looking after those within Australia. But, that very approach is now impacting our future, in my opinion. Our vaccination roll-out has been slow, whilst our economic recovery has been fast, but that is a holding position and not a progressive go forward approach. If you are stuck on the outside of Australia, trying to get home, it’s a long wait. With so much land and open spaces, I’d like to see a solution for bringing people home, bringing back talent from other countries, welcoming international students and opening up our borders for vaccinated travel. Our most inspiring political leaders in this part of the world are women, such as the NSW Premiere, Gladys Berejiklian https://www.gladys.com.au/ and the New Zealand Prime Minister, Jacinda Adern https://www.parliament.nz/en/mps-and-electorates/members-of-parliament/ardern-jacinda and they are incredible role models to all generations, no matter what side of politics people favour. They lead with compassion, kindness and practical leadership, which is what we need to see more of across all organisations.</p>

<p>On a cultural note, we have cultivated a warm corporate atmosphere in Australia. Business talk also blends with personal connection and people appreciate the power of the conversation. Our global clients welcome our friendly yet professional Australian style and we’ve really encouraged that warmth and human approach in all of our global work.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-the-best-piece-of-advice-you-can-offer-to-aspring-leaders">What is the best piece of advice you can offer to aspiring leaders?</h4>
<p>My best advice to aspiring leaders is the advice I give myself and my team: think more about other people than you do about yourself. Lead by being human, encouraging the best human in behaviour in your organisation. Align your brand and the organisation you represent with your own standards and values.</p>
<p>Recognise that business is personal, and people need people, so integrate people with technology and be proud of supporting the healthiest human system within your organisation. (Reference to John Flint, previous HSBC Leader who is known to this day as the leader who prioritised people).</p>
<h4 id="any-final-comments">Any final comments?</h4>
<p>I’d love to highlight the approach we are taking with Transition Hub to support transition into the future of work, preparing leaders for the future with inclusive and holistic professional development accelerators. www.transitionhub.com</p>
<h4 id="from-balletic-beginnings">From balletic beginnings</h4>
<p>Louise Watts began her working life as a classical ballerina in an Australian Ballet Company. Growing up in a country town in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, her main focus was on ballet classes, performing in Eisteddfods (competitive festivals of music and poetry in Australia), and preparing for examinations, which required a high standard of ballet, knowledge of French terms and nerves of steel. Academically, Watts had also performed well and would have gone into law, had she not chosen the stage.</p>
<p>After an eight-year career in professional ballet, she then went to university as a mature student, achieved a BA Communication from UTS Sydney and, by then, was running her own professional development business called Image &amp; Attitude. This smooth transition was facilitated by the confidence she had acquired from working as a performer and seeing the value of presence and impact within the corporate arena. Louise coined the phrase, “executive presence”, and it’s the platform on which she has built business ever since.</p>
<h4 id="leading-women">Leading women</h4>
<p>When Louise graduated from university, she was about to deliver her first child, Campbell, who is now 25 years old and about to go to his first Olympics as an Australian rower in Tokyo. She followed this up with a daughter, Giorgia, who she describes as a dynamic young woman and a leader of the future. What was important to her then and still is to this day, is the ability to integrate life, work and family into one, with the flexibility to prioritise any one aspect when need be. Louise’s team is all female, and she has found that they possess a natural tendency to get the job done, inject creativity and flexibility into their solutions, act as role models for women and men in business and cover for each other when family comes first.</p>
<h4 id="seeking-inspiration">Seeking inspiration</h4>
<p>When asked who or what has most inspired her to date, Louise explained that a great deal of her inspiration comes from the young people she sees who are making sense of the world we are moving into. Louise thinks that organisations need to trust the insight and energy of young minds and learn from them as much as guide them. She proposes a system whereby young leaders shadow senior executive teams and integrate generational knowledge. Transition is taking place before our very eyes and we are going to need to work together to make the future of work inclusive, dynamic and appropriate for generations to come.</p>
<p>At HPC Global and Transition Hub they have an amazing young woman on their team, Holly Bartter, who is integral to the business. Louise first met Holly when she began tutoring her children in senior English at school. Since then, Holly has gone on to develop her skills across media, tech, start-ups and client engagement. Louise explains that Transition Hub and HPC Global today would not be what they are without her.</p>
<p>She has also been inspired by the resilience and flexibility that she sees across the world, as people navigate this pandemic. People didn’t see it coming, but, says Louise, we knew something needed to change for people and the way they were working, evidenced by burnout, anxiety and lack of confidence across many cultures. ‘Our expectation was that automation and AI would require people to reskill, promote their human qualities and find joy in collaboration. Little did we know that would be fast tracked, due to COVID-19’. Louise describes herself as inclined to think we will come through this more mindful, thoughtful and empathetic than ever before.</p>

<h4 id="how-did-your-treasury-career-begin">How did your treasury career begin?</h4>
<p>As someone who loves numbers and math, treasury is very much second nature to me. When I went to college, I had no idea that treasury departments existed, so I never considered it as a career option.</p>
<p>After graduating from college, I went to work for a credit union, and from there I went on to work in the treasury department of an automotive supplier. I was hired to update signature cards, but on my first day the person responsible for cash quit. My manager asked me if I would be interested in learning their job. I thought ‘why not?’ And that is how my career in cash management and treasury began.</p>
<h4 id="how-much-opportunity-is-there-for-career-progression-in-your-current-role">How much opportunity is there for career progression in your current role?</h4>
<p>It’s easy to think of progression in treasury as being very linear, but in fact there are tremendous opportunities available. Treasury is not a single discipline. Within treasury and finance, it is possible to learn about a wide variety of subjects and processes. And not only the ones that presently exist, but also the ones on the horizon like cryptocurrencies or blockchain, etc. In addition, the acquisition of specialised knowledge gives the opportunity to carve a niche for yourself in treasury.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4>Tell us about your career and current role.</h4>
<p>I started my career at J.P. Morgan as a China strategist, from there I rose to become Head of China Access, building relationships with executives from China’s leading enterprises and providing strategic advice to senior institutional investors on China investments. Later I joined Jefferies, heading up their Corporate Access division for Asia Pacific. In 2018 I joined BlackRock as Head of Corporate Solutions for Asia Pacific tasked with building a team and business from scratch when BlackRock became one of the first asset managers to step into this space.</p>
<p>My ambition was always to build a business that I could be proud of. The goal of our team is to cultivate long-term relationships with corporates across public and private markets and align across the platform to advise and tailor one-stop solutions to corporates. The last three years have been challenging, but it is also exciting as the business is growing much faster than we thought when we began. The most important thing is to share our vision with all our stakeholders so they can trust what we are doing and we can work towards the same goals together.</p>
<h4>What is your advice regarding career progression?</h4>
<p>I have never put any limits on my goals or career progression. I have always dreamt big, and then worked hard to achieve it. I have built three businesses in three different firms, each one quite different given the fast-paced nature of change in the industry. I enjoy the challenge of working in a complex evolving business and use all the experiences that come my way to build resilience, leadership skills and a stepping stone to go further and higher.</p>
<p>It is challenging moving from one business to another. Particularly when it comes to sharing your vision and convincing those around you to trust you and align with the strategy. It comes down to leadership and the ability to communicate with your stakeholders both internally and externally. At BlackRock, when you are a Managing Director you are considered a leader for the whole firm. You lead your team, but you also lead horizontally across different functions acting as a role model for the whole business.</p>
<h4>How do you approach DEI?</h4>
<p>I sit on the firm’s talent and culture taskforce where my focus is to work with my partners on driving the firm’s DEI efforts in the region. DEI is a priority for our business because it is critical to our success. For our culture and our business, we believe positive outcomes result from more voices coming from people of varied backgrounds and experiences. The more we can reflect the real world, the more we can adjust to our clients’ needs and concerns. My objective is to work closely with colleagues, clients and partners to bring more DEI into our firm, industry and community.</p>
<h4>What advice would you give other women working in finance?</h4>
<p>The best piece of advice I have ever been given in my career is to own it! That involves finding a purpose and your own definition of success. Next, build a strong and supportive group of people around you who can be constructive, provide honest feedback and challenge your everyday thinking. These people should also advocate for your career and motivate you when you are facing failure. It is also important to set milestones and celebrate achievements. Lastly, my main advice is to work hard and don’t be afraid of failure.</p>
<p>I wish I had been braver and spoken up more through the course of my career – learning to stand up and speak up for what you believe in is hard. I would also advise younger women to say ‘yes’ to opportunities that scare them and be ready to embrace success and failure.</p>
<p>Experiences, good and bad, provide a solid foundation for the future. I also advise colleagues to be patient and focus on the long-term. I hear people say they are struggling to get promoted or they are suffering a setback. But this builds resilience to face short-term failures that make us stronger – there is no need to hurry career progression. People’s hard work and resilience will eventually pay off and what they deem a setback or failure will be their best asset and a source of confidence for the future. As a leader today, who has experienced a lot of setbacks, I am much more empathetic and confident because I can share my own frustrations and failures, and how I’ve learned to overcome setbacks.</p>
<h4>How should women ensure they are heard?</h4>
<p>Women can do a number of things to ensure they are heard. First, they need to believe in themselves; believe they have something important to say and be vocal. Second, they should cultivate strong relationships with sponsors, colleagues, and clients who can create opportunities for them to speak up. Lastly, support and advocate for other women. At BlackRock, we have several initiatives which include Courageous Conversations, Inclusion Dialogues and Taking on the Stage, which encourage our employees to speak up. In 2019, our WIN (Women’s Initiative Network) APAC Committee created a program called the WIN Power Hour, which features the most talented and accomplished female leaders across the industry to share their views and career advice. As for one of my favourite moto’s – it has to be Robert Ingersoll’s “We rise by lifting others.”</p></div>

<p><strong>Deepali Pendse:</strong> Serina, you’ve moved from the UK to Singapore to be with us. Tell me a little bit about your move and how this came about.</p>
<p><strong>Serina Hourican:</strong> I moved about nine months ago in the middle of the pandemic. I was delayed by about five months, which meant I had to start my APAC role from London. That was challenging, because I’ve got a team based in eight different countries across four different time zones. Doing that from London was quite difficult, especially when I had to get up so early in the morning – as you know, I’m not really a morning person! I was delighted that I could make it to Singapore in July.</p>
<p><strong>DP:</strong> It’s interesting to hear about your career. In the last 25 years I have seen my career evolve as I’ve worked in different continents, countries and lines of business. In every single move, I’ve been able to grow and invest in myself. My biggest takeaway is the importance of investing in your career – whether that’s by going back to school or making calculated moves in their career – and also to make yourself a little more uncomfortable, because that’s what brings the best out of you.</p>
<p>So tell me, Serina, how did you make yourself uncomfortable, and who helped you get to this level?</p>
<p><strong>SH:</strong> I was really supported by the bank when I moved from London to Singapore. I had to let my manager know a year in advance that I was open to new opportunities. It’s fascinating learning about different countries and cultures, so I’m pleased I can be here.</p>
<p>There have been a number of men and women who have helped me get here, and what really helped is that they believe in promoting diversity. In the past, people have tended to lean towards those who do things the same way as them. But diversity is about having people who think differently, and who can challenge each other and get the best out of each other.</p>
<p><strong>DP:</strong> I think we’ve both been lucky enough to be supported by people who believed in us, and as senior leaders we need to bring that forward. Serina, I know you always speak very fondly about your senior women colleagues, who have made you what you are today. Would you like to share something about them?</p>
<p><strong>SH:</strong> I really would. There’s one person that comes to mind: a lady who brought me into Bank of America. I used to work with her in my previous organisation and she really helped me grow my network and gave me the feedback I needed to help me grow.</p>
<p>One particular example was when we were looking at a promotion year, and she sat me down and said, “Look, we could put you through this year. But if you did X, Y and Z next year, I think you’d have a much better chance of getting it.” So that gave me something to work on, and I was successful in getting my promotion.</p>
<p><strong>DP:</strong> That sounds like a tough conversation for your mentor to have with you, but it’s interesting to know that when she said what she would do for you, she kept her word. I think that is so important when you’re looking up to your mentor or your sponsor.</p>
<p>The other thing I can see is that while she has let you know certain things need to be done in a different way, she has made sure you haven’t lost what you are. In my view, that’s what inclusion is all about – letting the other person be what he or she is, and giving that person a comfortable space to speak up. What’s also important is making sure that when you’re hearing, you’re actually listening and not just waiting to respond to what the other person is saying.</p>
<p><strong>SH:</strong> That really resonates with me. Sometimes my team will come to me and say they are nervous because they have to present to a client. What I say is, “Don’t worry, just be yourself.” I know some people don’t like that expression, but I think it’s really important that people can come to work and be themselves.</p>
<p><strong>DP:</strong> We’ve both been lucky to have such people in our professional lives. And I think we both have a small motto that we have always lived by. So what has yours been, Serina?</p>
<p><strong>SH:</strong> Mine is ‘Failing to prepare is preparing to fail’. I’m one of those people that like writing lots of notes and reading over them. For me, it really works, and I think when you’re looking at your career development, it’s about knowing what the potential next step could be, and not feeling like you missed an opportunity. What about you?</p>
<p id="video"><strong>DP:</strong> Mine is that whether it’s your personal life or your professional life, it’s like the stock market – it goes up, and it goes down. To a large extent, I think it’s important to treat every success as a blessing, and every failure as an opportunity to learn and grow. By looking at life in this way, we can become better versions of ourselves.</p></div>

<p><em>A special panel discussion on gender equality on International Women’s Day explores the positive and negative impact of the pandemic on equality. Elsewhere, delegates discuss the importance of role models and how remote working is allowing treasury to increasingly hire from a global talent pool.</em></p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body">
<p>“Choosing to challenge is part of my DNA. As a woman of colour, I haven’t had the benefit of not choosing to challenge” said <a href="https://www.leadershipforexecs.com">India Gary-Martin, Executive Coach and Advisor to Global CEO’s and Boards from Leadership for Execs</a>, opening Treasury Today’s "International Women's Day – virtual event" in partnership with treasury software provider <a href="https://www.kyriba.com/">Kyriba</a>.  For India, recent challenges have come in the form of leaving a corporate career to work for herself as a coach and motivational speaker. “Hitting barriers means you go in a different direction; it doesn’t mean you stop,” she told delegates, saying IWD2021 and its rallying call to ‘choose to challenge’ is a chance to take stock of the challenges and progress over the last year wrought by the pandemic.</p>
<h4 id="mentors-and-seminal-moments">Mentors and seminal moments</h4>
<p>Panel speakers reflected on the seminal moments in their life that led them to strive for equality. Dory Malouf, Senior Principal Value Engineer at Kyriba, recalled the lasting impact that hearing Anita Hill’s 1991 testimony had on his student self. The way Hill was “treated by the media,” and how she was “asked questions by Senators trying to catch her out” following her accusation that US Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her, marked the beginning of his awareness. A few years later during an internship, his mentor left to have a baby due to “a lack of options to maintain her career”, leaving another imprint on the impact of inequality.</p>
<p>It led Dory to recount of his chance to act on this early learning. When a member of his team with a young baby said she wanted to leave, he was determined to support her to stay, offering part-time and working from home solutions. “I didn’t want her to be in the same position as my mentor; it’s hard to come back after taking time off.” She stayed, and the process opened the door to others in his team, he said.</p>
<p>Danette Le, Vice President and Assistant Treasurer, Corporate Finance, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts, dates her passion for gender equality to witnessing “fewer women” in meetings and conferences as her career progressed. Her passion is also fuelled by double standards - like women showing emotions typically viewed as “weak” but men showing their emotions often seen as “positive.” She also recounted the early influence of a female boss in mentoring and building her confidence. “She allowed me to raise my hand for assignments and speak up about promotion,” she recalled.</p>
<p>Panellist Mary Wienclaw, Senior Manager of Foreign Exchange and Forecast Management, Baxter International Inc, noted the importance of so-called allies in fostering equality, particularly the growing number of men supporting equal opportunities for women. “A lot more men are now saying we need more women in leadership roles,” she said. “I didn’t see this early in my career.” Panellists also noted how women have grown better at supporting other women, and no longer see each other as competitors.</p>
<h4 id="wfh">WFH</h4>
<p>Next the conversation touched on the importance of leadership during the pandemic. For Karen James, Head of Treasury at Sightsavers, where she leads a team of six, it has required a new type of leadership. Many women have been spending recent months home schooling children alongside doing their jobs, requiring a new level of inclusivity, support and empowerment. “My role as head of treasury is to empower them to try things and not be afraid,” she said, adding that her own female boss leads by example, particularly around supporting mental health through lockdown and ensuring opportunities. Elsewhere the discussion touched on how working from home has been a leveller between mothers and fathers. “Men get interrupted on Zoom calls too,” she said. “We mustn’t lose sight of how much effort it takes to run a day in the life of a mum and dad also holding down a job,” she added.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, WFH also has a flip side for equality. Panellists raised concerns about how many women have left the workforce because of COVID-19, unable to both work from home and home-school. “Why have so many women been hit by this?” asked Dory, calling for more analysis into why women, rather than WFH men are leaving employment. “This is a step backwards rather than forwards, and it needs studying.”</p>
<h4 id="what-is-professional">What is professional?</h4>
<p>Mary, a mother of four, said that combing childcare and working from home has led her to “re-define” her view of a professional role. Before, she frequently prioritised her job and career over her family, but now she has “no choice” but to put caring for her children on an equal footing. “I consider all these roles as part of who I am, and my authentic self means I am all these things at one time. If my daughter bursts in on a Zoom meeting, it is ok,” she said, calling on WFH women also caring for children to change how they perceive themselves.</p>
<p>It was a point that echoed with Danette, who said “re-defining” what is professional makes it much easier to balance home and work life and enables “feeling good” about being both a parent and a working professional. Karen added that one of the challenges was the lack of corporate recognition for being a “professional mum.”</p>
<p>Danette added that WFH with two young children had built a resilience in her, particularly given the last year has been one of the busiest and toughest for her industry which has furloughed 80% of its employees. “I have experienced some of busiest times in my career, but also spent more time with my family.”</p>
<h4 id="buffett-and-obama">Buffett and Obama</h4>
<p>Next the conversation turned to the importance of role models. For Dory, Barak Obama has championed the cause of male allies. “He always talks about putting women and equality centre stage. From my viewpoint he is a leader here.” Dory also noted Warren Buffett’s leadership via Berkshire Hathaway’s celebrated investment in companies that have women on their boards. “To be successful, you have to have diversity; diversity brings a different perspective,” said Dory.</p>
<p>Michelle Obama is another role model. Mary noted how she “quoted her quite a bit”, particularly around the importance of using your voice when you have a seat at the table. Karen agreed on the “transformational” role of Obama, citing her as another strong woman “driving me to be better than I am.”</p>
<h4 id="challenges-of-returning">Challenges of returning</h4>
<p>Next, Danette reflected on the dangers of women missing out if they choose to work remotely when office life begins again. “Could this benefit threaten gender equality?” she asked. “If more women are working from home, will they miss out on opportunities to connect, network and advance their careers? Companies need to ensure there is no favouritism to those that work from home.”</p>
<p>Indeed, panellists reflected that “quite a high proportion” of jobs will likely remain remote. “Some areas of treasury have suffered by being remote, like FX and banking where we have had to learn on the hoof, but the technology is amazing,” said Karen. Dory agreed, noting a trend amongst some companies seeking a global talent pool to hire treasury professionals in different geographies, far away from the corporate centre. “They want the most talented person period; it doesn’t matter where they are, they just have to work odd hours.”</p>
<h4 id="pro-action">Pro-action</h4>
<p>Delegates also reflected on the importance of a proactive approach to gender equality. Danette recounted how she has set up a women’s initiative as part of the company’s diversity and inclusion strategy. For now, the initiative runs virtual events like book clubs and happy hours in an effort to support and connect until they can meet face to face. As for her role model, she said it was her own working mother. “She taught me you have to work hard and not worry what others think.”</p>
<p>Mary recounted how she has changed jobs through the pandemic. Her decision (that took some courage given the economic upheaval of the pandemic) was made easier with the support of a mentor. “It required a confidence in myself to make that jump,” she said.</p>
<p id="video">Panellists also expressed their hopes for the future. Reflecting on the path ahead for her 22-year-old daughter, Karen said her role was to “teach her and encourage her” and “support her to be the woman she needs and wants to be.” She added that her daughter thinks “differently” about the world and is aiming as high as she can, in contrast to previous generations who have suffered discrimination. “Her destiny and future are in her hands. Each step she is taking will reinforce the fact that woman were born to be seen and included.”</p>

<p>Alexandra has over ten years’ experience in corporate finance and treasury positions across multinational corporations. She joined Nestlé as Regional Treasurer for North America in 2019. In this role she heads up the treasury operations for the region, with responsibilities for cash management, foreign exchange hedging, supply chain finance and merchant services. In addition to supporting capital markets activity and overseeing the capital structure for the US, she continually seeks out opportunities to leverage new technologies and solutions. Alexandra holds an MBA from The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania and a BA in Economics from Wellesley College.</p>

<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h3>Tell us how you arrived at your current role.</h3>
<p>Like many people I fell into treasury. After I earned my MBA in Finance, I joined a financial rotation programme at Constellation Energy where I served on their treasury and Financial Planning &amp; Analysis teams.</p>
<p>My first rotation was in treasury, specifically capital markets. I loved it. And what I loved most about working in treasury was that every day was different. One day might be spent working on foreign exchange hedging; the next day reviewing capital structures – and the following day focusing on solving a cash management pooling structure problem.</p>
<p>After almost three years I had the opportunity to join Hilton. Although Hilton was a privately owned company, it was planning to go public, which meant there was the opportunity to really improve and transform the treasury function.</p>
<p>Then about 18 months ago I moved to Nestlé to be Regional Treasurer for North America.</p>
<h3>How much opportunity is there for career progression in your role?</h3>
<p>I am extremely fortunate to be able to work for a company like Nestlé – not just because it has such a global reach, but also because it believes that people are its most important assets. This shows in the coaching, training and empowering of each individual. Because Nestlé believes in investing in its employees, the opportunities could range from a global treasury role to a financial leader within one of the divisions. It really comes down to how you want to challenge yourself and grow your career.</p>
<h3>What is the best piece of advice that you have been given?</h3>
<p>There are two pieces of advice that I have received in my career that have been helpful to me. The first is that just because you might fail doesn’t mean you should not try. And the second is to always ask ‘why?’</p>
<h3>What advice would you give to junior treasurers to advance their careers?</h3>
<p>If you want to develop a career in treasury you must always be prepared to learn new things. Change is a constant and you will need to adapt.</p>
<p>Since the best way to learn is through hands-on experience, junior treasurers should seek out many different opportunities and experiences, thereby gaining a solid understanding of the fundamentals of treasury. And if you can’t change positions, I would recommend volunteering to lead short-term projects. As you expand your experience you will begin to see how the different parts of treasury interrelate, and how treasury’s activities impact the rest of the company.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h3 id="catalyst-for-change">Catalyst for change</h3>
<p>In order for treasurers to make their voices heard within their organisations, Alexandra believes that they need to show the ways in which treasury is a strategic partner to the business – not just by highlighting its focus on stewardship and continuous improvement, but also by driving solutions that add value.</p>
<p>“Treasury should always be focused on understanding a business’s strategy, developing solutions to support those priorities and finding new technologies that can be leveraged,” she says. “Our treasury team is focused on understanding key gaps or obstacles to overcome, applying our financial expertise to introduce new solutions to our businesses.” Alexandra believes that in these ways, treasury can be an effective catalyst for change and help to drive transformation: “It’s important to demonstrate the positive impact of solutions in a quantitative way, and communicate that to as wide an audience as possible.”</p>
<p>For women who wish to advance their careers in treasury, Alexandra believes that seizing all available opportunities, combined with a willingness to learn, is key. “Identify opportunities to start building skills such as managing or coaching, or leading cross-functional projects outside of treasury,” she advises. “Experience has taught me it is not about the title, or about how many people report to you. It is always about learning. If you are not learning anything in your current role, start looking for a new challenge. It’s also important to seek feedback on how you perform in these areas, so don’t be afraid of that.”</p>
<p>In addition, Alexandra believes that gaining a strong understanding of emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and robotic process automation, is becoming more central to day-to-day treasury management.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote><p>You don’t have the opportunity to have an impromptu chat, share a coffee or go out and celebrate as a team. You have to work harder to on-board new members, to develop a sense of camaraderie and team spirit.</p>

<div class="copy__body"><h3 id="broader-perspective">Broader perspective</h3>
<p>Although Alexandra focused on developing a deep understanding of treasury early on in her career, she says that she sometimes found herself saying yes to projects or initiatives that she was not sure that she could achieve. However, she has also come to understand that the most important thing is having confidence in her own abilities. “I loved my work in treasury and believed becoming a technical expert would make me a stronger treasurer in the future,” she says. “However, having had more experience, I have come to realise that you don’t need to have all of the answers to be a leader in treasury.”</p>
<p>In fact, she believes that having experience in other areas such as operations can help with gaining a greater understanding of the impact treasury can have on the rest of an organisation. Treasury should not exist in an ivory tower, but should maintain good communications and collaborate with stakeholders across the organisation.</p>
<p>“We can’t just assume that everyone understands what we do and why we do it, whether it’s hedging foreign exchange or handling intra-group loans in a certain way,” says Alexandra. “Treasury needs to explain the benefits of what it does and the reasons why, and how it brings a positive impact to the business. It also needs to understand why other departments do what they do. Because at the end of the day, it is the business that drives the value in the company.”</p>
<p>As a leader, Alexandra acknowledges the challenge of keeping the team fully engaged and motivated in a virtual environment. “You don’t have the opportunity to have an impromptu chat, share a coffee or go out and celebrate as a team. You have to work harder to on-board new members, to develop a sense of camaraderie and team spirit,” she explains.</p>
<p>However, for all the difficulties the past year has presented, Alexandra remains focused on helping the team stay motivated and engaged. “When I joined Nestlé, my team and I have developed a vision for the kind of treasury department that we want to be,” she says. “Last year we launched a number of initiatives and changes. It has taken a huge amount of effort and a lot of hard work, and now those labours are beginning to bear fruit. We are not there yet, but we are well on the way to becoming the strategic partner for the business that we envisioned from the beginning.”</p></div>

<p><em>March 8<sup>th</sup> was International Women’s Day. This year’s theme was Choose to Challenge. This galvanising phrase is designed to spark a will to provoke change through challenge. In the 2021 fight for gender equality it is vital that we elicit the support and engagement of allies of all genders. As the organisation behind International Women’s Day explains, ‘A challenged world is an alert world. Individually, we’re all responsible for our own thoughts and actions – all day, every day. We can all choose to challenge and call out gender bias and inequality. We can all choose to seek out and celebrate women’s achievements. Collectively, we can all help create an inclusive world. From challenge comes change, so let’s all choose to challenge.’</em></p>

<p>What is the path for all those seeking more than mere performative allyship? For those who seek to challenge the status quo and wish to promote positive change in their organisations, teams, industries and societies? What is International Women’s Day and why is it important to have a date in our calendars in which we mark and celebrate a group in society, in this case women?</p>
<p>Every year on March 8<sup>th</sup>, International Women’s Day is recognised the world over. Its origins appear to lie in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, originating from within socialism, namely within the Socialist Party of America and the International Socialist Women’s Conference. On February 28<sup>th</sup> 1909 there was a National Women’s Day in New York City organised by the Socialist Party of America. Then, in 1910, a special day was proposed at the International Socialist Women’s Conference. The conference endorsed the idea of a day each year which would be an international day of concerted action to protest for female suffrage. Then, starting in 1911, the day was celebrated across much of the Austro-Hungarian Empire on March 19<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>International Women’s Day serves as a marker for women’s suffrage across the world. All the while the fight for equality in terms of access, pay and representation is ongoing, International Women’s Day serves as a moment of unity for global efforts and visibility for the ongoing struggle. It is a moment for education, enlistment and reckoning.</p>
<p>Treasury Today Group has long been committed to the fight for gender equality in corporate finance and beyond. Our Women in Treasury initiative works daily to offer a platform for women in the industry and a space to both educate and celebrate allies to the cause. Everybody has a role to play in ending gender discrimination in our industry and our platform is inclusive with a role and a voice for all.</p>
<p>International Women’s Day for us is therefore a great moment for reflection. A time to assess the progress that has been made, to look at the learnings that have come from the push for gender equality. As this struggle has expanded to include diversity and inclusion in all its forms, what are some of the key learning experiences that we can take from the conversations we’ve been having around gender equality and apply to issues such as racial equity, LGBTQ+ inclusion and so on? Gender is the most visible and the most easily discussed of differences and so can be a gateway to conversations around other pervasive and pernicious forms of discrimination which occur in society and in our industry.</p>
<p>International Women’s Day this year also marked the rather grim milestone of one year since the start of the world’s lockdown orders and pandemic victims. As vaccination programmes roll out slowly but surely across the world, we can also take this opportunity to assess the large impact that the pandemic is unfortunately having on progress in gender equality.</p>
<p>There were many reports over the course of 2020 which highlighted the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on women and, certainly in the US, particularly black and Hispanic women (https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/covid-19-and-gender-equality-countering-the-regressive-effects). The pandemic has shone a light on the existing inequalities of our societies and has cruelly had the greatest impact upon the most vulnerable amongst us. Conversations which we believed had progressed around women’s roles at home and gender equality have been stripped bare by the disproportionate burden of domestic roles which seem to be falling upon women. The pandemic seems destined to make 1950s housewives of us all, as the long-term impact of increased domestic responsibilities and financial uncertainty upon women’s progression in the workplace is yet to be seen. We know that the first step to overcoming barriers to women’s progress is to acknowledge their existence. It is one of the reasons that our Women in Treasury Global Study data forms the heart of our dialogues around gender equality each year.</p>
<p>This year on International Women’s Day, Treasury Today Group was delighted to partner with Kyriba to host a digital event to mark the day. The event included a very special guest line up featuring a fireside chat with India Gary-Martin, Leadership for Executives (https://www.leadershipforexecs.com), Danette Le, Vice President and Assistant Treasurer of Hosthotels, Mary Wienclaw, Senior Manager of Foreign Exchange and Forecast Management at Baxter International and Dory Malouf, Senior Principal Value Engineer at Kyriba.</p>
<p>This was a moment to reflect on the progress that we have seen and the ongoing setbacks to female equality. The Women in Treasury Global Study data allows us to chart the progress seen in the industry. Without this data set we have no way of documenting the trials and tribulations, challenges and achievements of the gender equality agenda.</p>
<p>Our latest data set demonstrated some cause for celebration, with particular steps forward made somewhat obviously over the course of 2020 in flexibility and remote working. This is, of course, an area that has been entirely transformed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The changes in this space in 2020 may well have altered the landscape of how and where we work forever.</p>
<p>In terms of quotas for female representation and ethnic diversity at board level, which is one of the key markers that we at the Treasury Today Group have been monitoring over the past decade, 47% of the 2020 respondents support a quota for female representation on boards. 38% of our respondents support a quota for ethnic diversity. Support for a quota for female representation on boards has increased year on year since the start of our Women in Treasury Global Study to this current level.</p>
<p>When it comes to gender parity, there is also improvement in this space. However, 35% of our 2020 respondents still felt they were paid less than their male counterparts. This is down on 47% in 2019. Other areas showing an ongoing need for attention included exclusion at social events. As we celebrate successes in gender equality it is important that we are aware of the privileges and powers that our respondents possess, as we seek to remove the barriers to progress for all those who face discrimination in the workplace. One of the items on the agenda for our conversation on March 8th was practical tips and support for women who are negotiating pay, as we know that historical discrepancies can end up following women throughout their careers. There are, however, some tools that can be employed to great avail in order for women to be recompensed at the same levels as their male counterparts. As rallying cries for transparency on pay remuneration grow across the world we also offered some guidance for male allies who may be well placed to share information and support their female counterparts in order to rebalance historic inequity.</p>
<p>For the first time in 2020, 17% of respondents in 2020 were male and we are grateful to all those who completed last year’s study, set against a backdrop of a global pandemic and immense economic uncertainty for countries across the world. As mentioned earlier, the platforms that International Women’s Day and the Women in Treasury initiative have created need allies of all genders to support and inform industry conversations. International Women’s Day is a time for us all to come together to challenge the status quo and to be agents of positive change in our organisations. We welcome everybody to get more involved, not just once a year, but every day with our work around gender equality in corporate finance.

<h4 id="can-you-tell-me-about-your-professional-background-and-your-current-role">Can you tell me about your professional background and your current role?</h4>
<p>After reading law at university, the only thing that I knew on graduating was that I did not want to practise law for a living! I was given the opportunity to join Citi’s Management Associate programme and during one of my training rotations, I ended up working in the Global Transaction Services team in Singapore. At that time - in the mid-nineties - the concept of corporate cash management was fairly new to Asia, but my manager brought me on in what was  essentially a sales associate role. It then evolved into a marketing role because I ended up doing a lot of the communications and messaging for the business. After a few years, I moved from Citi to HSBC and then to Standard Chartered Bank. Since then, I have transitioned to different Marketing roles in the B2B environment, and almost always in financial services.</p>
<p>After Standard Chartered, I returned to Citi again and eventually ended up working in New York. I then decided to return to Asia after three years, joining Thomson Reuters in their Financial and Risk business, where I ran the Asia Marketing team.  All the experience that I have gained as a Marketer has led me to my current role. I have always viewed Marketing as being more than just an events and communications function: it can support the sales teams to drive business. In fact, I would say that everything I’ve done in my professional career has been about sales enablement in some way, with a specific focus on corporate and institutional banking.</p>
<h4 id="why-do-you-think-it-is-important-to-promote-inclusion-and-diversity">Why do you think it is important to promote inclusion and diversity?</h4>
<p>I really have been fortunate in my career. I have had the chance to live in different countries, I have also worked in various corporate cultures, so I recognise and believe that the best results come from having different perspectives. There is always something that you haven't thought of yourself. Our greatest learnings come from listening to different people and recognising that there are other unique points of view.</p>
<p>I have always believed that having diversity of thought is the most powerful tool you can have in an organisation and that comes not just from gender and racial diversity but spans language, religion and so on. I have worked in offices where people do not speak English as a first language, but because they work in  a multi-cultural and multi-national environment where English is the business language, they may not always be able to express themselves as articulately. It affects the perception of their presentation skills and I hope I have learned to become sensitive to this.</p>
<h4 id="broadening-our-horizons">Broadening our horizons</h4>
<p>When encountering discrimination or prejudice in the workplace, I have learnt that at the end of the day you have to give people the benefit of the doubt. Credibility is earned, and if you do not have it with colleagues then you have to work out how to change peoples’ minds. When confronting our own prejudices and biases, I have learnt that although it is incredibly hard, we must recognise that we all make generalisations. I found attending a course on unconscious bias helpful - programmes like this force you to reflect on your behaviours and think about how to improve them.</p>
<p>I have also observed regional variations in diversity and inclusion conversations. In the US, specifically New York, it tends to be more focused on gender, sexual orientation and race, particularly black identity. In Asia, the conversation around gender is nuanced, as there is an extra dimension of “localisation” that really is unique since the region is not homogeneous. However, one of the practical things that I believe we can apply in any region is to focus on constant communication. Speaking up and sharing your point of view, as well as listening to others, is really important, as is not being shy and trying to break through some of those traditional barriers.</p>
<h4 id="push-and-pull">Push and pull</h4>
<p>To truly drive change, I believe senior leadership must pro-actively listen, reach out and be willing to spend time with colleagues. And I’d advise the next generation that they must recognise that they should keep sharing their thoughts and experiences with people who are willing to listen and give them a platform to also speak up.</p>
<p>I believe it comes down to creating an environment where people feel they have flexibility and are valued. It’s about having a guiding framework and structure, because diversity and inclusion rules are going to apply differently to different people.  As the saying goes: ‘We're all in the same storm, but we're not all in the same boat’.</p>
<p>Finally, I believe that employers should support staff with responsibilities and priorities other than children. For example, people who want to be able to prioritise taking care of their parents or even distant relatives or close friends. These “life choice” decisions should also be equitable to parenthood. The future environment should support all employees, as   we increasingly redefine what family is and adjust the framework we offer to those who work with and for us.</p>

<p>Christine Stokes is a Managing Director at State Street Global Advisors and Chief Operating Officer for its Global Cash Business. In this role, she works closely with the Global Head of Cash in developing and executing the overall strategic plan for the business.</p>
<p>Prior to joining State Street Global Advisors, Christine worked at State Street Global Services for almost 20 years. In her previous role, she was responsible for servicing over US$200b in assets, including accounting for US$70b in money market fund assets. Prior to that, Christine was primarily responsible for the oversight of several significant institutional money market fund custody relationships.</p>
<p>She graduated with a BS in Business Administration from Providence College. She also holds Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Series 7 and 63 licenses.</p>

<h4 id="tell-us-about-your-current-position">Tell us about your current position.</h4>
<p>In my current role, I am responsible for the oversight of the infrastructure supporting our global cash distribution efforts, including the management of our client service teams, partnerships with our service providers and driving enhancements for our internal and external technology platforms. I also work closely with the Global Head of our business to develop and execute our strategic plan.</p>
<p>Prior to this, I worked my way up to the Unit Manager role within State Street’s mutual funds operations division and was responsible for custody and accounting for one of the world’s largest asset managers.</p>
<h4 id="what-advice-you-would-give-to-women-in-finance-in-terms-of-establishing-and-developing-a-career">What advice you would give to women in finance in terms of establishing and developing a career?</h4>
<p>Whatever job you’re in now, commit yourself to it and work hard. If your current role isn’t where your true passion lies, remember that you are building the foundation of your future career.</p>
<p>Don’t underestimate the importance of building relationships. You can help others by being dependable and trustworthy – these traits will help you further on in your career. Once you have more experience, people will remember how you helped them and may recommend you or hire you for the next great thing.</p>
<p>Ask a lot of questions. Just by continuing to learn, I was able to ensure that I understood my responsibilities fully and could contribute in a meaningful way.  It can also make your job more interesting if you learn more about an issue and can fix it.</p>
<p>We hear a lot about the importance of speaking up in meetings. In today’s virtual terms, that means making sure that you are visible in the video. Even if you don’t have a major speaking role, show that you are present and engaged.</p>
<h4 id="do-you-think-it-is-important-to-have-a-defined-career-plan">Do you think it is important to have a defined career plan?</h4>
<p>I actually didn’t have a plan when I started out on my career. When I came out of college, I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do, which left me open to new experiences and opportunities that I may not have considered otherwise.</p>
<p>While it can be a good idea to have a plan, especially if you have very specific goals or a clear idea of where you want to be, being flexible and open to new things is essential. Things rarely progress in a straight line – it’s the lateral moves in your career that really build out your experience.</p>
<h4 id="how-can-junior-professionals-be-empowered-to-challenge-bias-and-promote-diversity">How can junior professionals be empowered to challenge bias and promote diversity?</h4>
<p>From a leader’s point of view, the most important thing is the kind of culture that you set. If you are open and transparent with your team, they will be far more comfortable sharing their thoughts, concerns and ideas.</p>
<p>As a junior professional, it can be helpful to join employee resource groups that have specific missions. We have a variety of them at State Street Global Advisors, and I know that, as an organization, we are not alone.</p>
<h4 id="new-ways-of-working">New ways of working</h4>
<p>As for so many others, the COVID-19 pandemic had a sudden and significant impact on Christine and her team at the beginning of the year. By April, the whole team was working remotely. “I think most people have found this time incredibly challenging,” she says. “Fortunately, we were able to work from home almost right away. I know not everybody had that luxury.”</p>
<p>In fact, Christine was pleasantly surprised with the speed at which her team was able to adapt to new ways of working. “It’s one thing to be working remotely one day a week, but to be operating in in an environment that is 100% remote and engaging with clients in new ways, while at the same time staying motivated, is truly impressive.”</p>
<p>That said, there were some technical difficulties to overcome. With clients working remotely, one of the biggest challenges was dealing with procedures that were office- or paper-based and needed to be adapted to accommodate the new remote environment. But by cooperating closely with their transfer agents, her team was able to adapt to interacting with clients in different ways. “I have been incredibly proud of the way my team has risen to the challenge,” says Christine.</p>
<h4 id="the-momentum-for-change">The momentum for change</h4>
<p>In recent years, State Street Global Advisors has been a key player in furthering female representation on the boards of the world’s top companies – not least due to the power of its proxy vote, which it uses to drive change.</p>
<p>Since 2017, in partnership with Treasury Today, the firm has also hosted numerous events around the world to further the diversity dialogue within the industry. During this time, the conversation has continued to evolve. “At the beginning of our journey together, we were focused on gender diversity,” Christine explains, “and the Women in Treasury Global Study in partnership with Treasury Today was such a great backdrop for the conversation.”</p>
<p>Many of the events took the form of small intimate gatherings in which the topics of inclusion and diversity could be discussed in a relaxed and natural way. “It was great to have small get-togethers which allowed people the means to speak up in a way that they might not feel comfortable doing in a larger forum,” Christine notes.</p>
<p>In a continually evolving business and social landscape, Christine believes that promoting the inclusion of women is the beginning of a wider discussion around diversity. “We need to continue the conversation promoting diversity and inclusion for everyone,” she concludes. “There is a tremendous momentum for change right now across the globe; it would be a shame to waste this opportunity.”</p>

<h4 id="tell-us-about-your-current-position">Tell us about your current position.</h4>
<p>I’m currently the Global Head of Cash at State Street Global Advisors, which means I’m responsible for the distribution of our liquidity investment expertise to cash investors around the world. I joined the firm in March earlier this year just before the pandemic kicked off, so I had less than two weeks in the office before everyone was sent home. Starting a new job in the middle of a market and health crisis, having to work virtually and while juggling young kids being at home and then needing to build and nurture relationships with a bunch of strangers on whom I was entirely dependent for the success of my business – it was a life learning experience!</p>
<p>In my previous role, I was running the  European and Asian Liquidity Distribution team for Morgan Stanley Investment Management. I had been extremely happy there and really enjoyed my team, my manager and the overall working environment. Yet an offer from State Street Global Advisors to take on global responsibilities (whilst staying based in London), to expand my experience within the US market and to grow my management and leadership responsibilities in an exponential way, was too compelling to turn down.</p>
<h4 id="how-can-junior-professionals-be-empowered-to-challenge-bias-and-promote-diversity">How can junior professionals be empowered to challenge bias and promote diversity?</h4>
<p>We must all own this issue, regardless of your role or where you fit within the corporate hierarchy. This is not just a management issue: bias –conscious and unconscious– is an issue that we all need to be challenging, all the time. As leaders, we need to ensure an environment is created where people aren’t afraid to use their voice. In other words, we should all feel empowered,  if something appears to be wrong, not to accept it – make sure you escalate it, and find somebody you can talk to about it. That means it’s important to ensure that everybody is encouraged to use their voice and that we create an environment where people aren’t afraid to speak up, even if their opinion is an outlier from the group.</p>
<p>At the same time, we should all be trying to promote diversity and build relationships with colleagues who come from different cultural, racial and language backgrounds from our own. We all need to be conscious of, and temper, our natural inclination to form groupings only with people who look and think the same as us.</p>
<h4 id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-women-in-finance-in-terms-of-establishing-and-developing-a-career">What advice would you give to women in finance in terms of establishing and developing a career?</h4>
<p>Don’t be limited by your own thoughts or existing skillset. Believe in yourself – and if you are offered a stretch opportunity, take it and push yourself. It can often be challenging to quash the inevitable self-doubt but ensure you’re always open to seeking new opportunities and not waiting for them to come to you. By  actively looking for new experiences, relationships and networks, you will ensure people know you are open to maintaining your career trajectory.</p>
<p>Make sure you’re behaving professionally at every point in your career. There is truth in the adage that the treasury and financial services world is a small community. The more senior you get, the greater the likelihood that your next job is going to come from someone you’ve already met along your career journey. Don’t leave an organisation on a bad note if you can help it and don’t bad-mouth anyone on the way out (even if they are more junior colleagues – they might be offering you a job at a later stage in your career!)</p>
<p>And of course, needless to say, you need to work hard and keep your focus. Find a way to manage stress in a way that works for you (there’s no one-size-fits-all) and find the right balance between your work and where it fits into your life’s priorities.</p>
<h4 id="do-you-think-it-is-important-to-have-a-defined-career-plan">Do you think it is important to have a defined career plan?</h4>
<p>I never had a defined career plan – and I wouldn’t change that, because having an open mind took me to places I didn’t know existed. So, clearly, I would recommend having an open mind and making sure you are open to all kinds of opportunities.</p>
<p>At a recent panel session, , one of the panellists said, ‘Don’t be afraid of taking a sideways move.’ That really resonated for me. You don’t always have to move upward,.  At certain times in your career – particularly if you have a change in your personal circumstances – it might help you not to have an all-consuming  role for a period of time when you need to focus more on your personal commitments. Moreover, a sideways move can often give you a breadth of experience that you might not otherwise get, so don’t automatically dismiss these kinds of opportunities.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-your-motto-in-life-or-your-greatest-inspiration">What is your motto in life, or your greatest inspiration?</h4>
<p>I was inspired by this quote from the German writer Goethe, which my father had up on the wall of his office when I was growing up: “Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it.” My other favourite mantra is “Just do it” (thank you Nike!)</p>
<h4 id="the-power-of-networking">The power of networking</h4>
<p>At the beginning of the year, Kim was recruited into her current role by a former colleague she has known for a number of years. “We worked together at Merrill Lynch in 2005, and our paths have crossed a number of times since then,” she says. “He actually tried to hire me seven years ago, but I had already committed to start a new job at Morgan Stanley.” As Kim points out, this only underlines how important it is to network effectively and to display professionalism in the workplace – “you never know who is going to help you get your next role.”</p>
<h4 id="working-virtually">Working virtually</h4>
<p>Since moving into her current position, Kim says she has learned many valuable lessons. Building new relationships and establishing trust in a virtual environment is a challenging task. “All of us need to find something to counter-balance inevitable virtual meeting fatigue, as well as the numbing  effect of spending the entire day sitting at a desk without the variety of environments and stimulus that a real-life office would bring you.” As Kim notes, informal, spontaneous interactions are missing from the virtual world. “So much comes from the informal discussion you might have after a meeting” and our challenge is to recreate that somehow in a virtual environment.</p>
<h4 id="driving-diversity-and-inclusion">Driving diversity and inclusion</h4>
<p>When it comes to diversity and inclusion, Kim observes that the last five years have brought a real step change across the industry. “I’ve held a number of positions on diversity committees in different organisations, and I felt like we were always pushing against a locked door,” she reflects. “But now it feels like we’re pushing on a door that is slightly ajar.”  Another encouraging evolution of the discussion is the “the understanding that diversity doesn’t just mean gender diversity any longer, but is much broader than that.”</p>
<p>She believes that, in part, this change is the result of the work people have done to keep the topic of diversity and inclusion at the forefront of conversations: “We talk about this all the time, and it’s now become both acceptable and expected to talk about it.” Large asset managers like State Street Global Advisors have pushed companies to drive change at Board level and include female directors.</p>
<p>Another factor, says Kim, is that diversity is increasingly being tracked and measured. The publication of pertinent data not only helps to keep the topic in the public eye, but is prompting companies to strive for change, “rather than just paying lip service to it.”
 And of course, the events of 2020 have also played an important role in moving the discussion forward. As Kim notes,  the acceptability of flexible working has undergone a revolution this year and that helps drive diversity in a meaningful way.</p>

<h4 id="tell-us-a-bit-about-how-you-got-to-your-current-position">Tell us a bit about how you got to your current position?</h4>
<p>I didn’t get a finance degree. I studied political science, and initially worked in Washington DC, thinking I would go into international relations or international law. But it didn’t quite live up to my ideal, and I decided to switch gears. That is when I stumbled into banking. It had that macro- economic connection that I was interested in and I was lucky enough to have exposure to advisory and corporate finance. I also worked in equity capital markets and leverage finance before moving onto commodities after a friend, who knew me well, recommended it because they had a sense I would really like it. I’ve been here ever since!</p>
<p>It’s an interesting domain because our financing is really the core piece of debt - the lifeline of these companies. It allows a close advisory relationship with our clients’ finance teams. We are not waiting in line, we are having consistent dialogue with the treasury folks and are really value- add. Our clients still have a heavy male skew, but it is changing and there are some female CFOs.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-the-biggest-challenge-you-are-facing-now">What is the biggest challenge you are facing now?</h4>
<p>The challenge of COVID is tough. I am good at taking emotional cues and reading people, but this is difficult on WebEx; my work also involves developing relationships and managing a team and it’s difficult in the current environment. I’ve tried to be more spontaneous and set up one-on-one calls with my group because a group WebEx doesn’t give you a window into how people are really doing, whether they are feeling disconnected or demotivated. Leadership is also about cultivating your juniors and helping them build their brand. We must ensure that they can get visibility with senior managers, and this sometimes requires forcing situations. For example, asking a senior leader to talk to one of the juniors on a call - it’s not an organic situation.</p>
<h4 id="how-can-junior-professionals-be-empowered-to-challenge-bias-and-promote-diversity">How can junior professionals be empowered to challenge bias and promote diversity?</h4>
<p>There are female role models, but it is not easy to get to the top. You must differentiate yourself and build your brand, which is difficult in a COVID-distanced world. I have role models and wonderful support. My boss is a champion of diversity, and I really appreciate that. I am lucky to have the support that I do, but the challenge lies in how I can really demonstrate my leadership skills and cultivate that in a COVID environment.</p>
<p>There is an understanding among banks that they lack diversity at the top, and I believe banks are willing to engage in this conversation. Juniors should take advantage of whatever efforts their companies are making. Everyone is still looking for tools, so juniors should suggest paths and tools.</p>
<h4 id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-women-in-finance-in-terms-of-establishing-and-developing-a-career">What advice would you give to women in finance in terms of establishing and developing a career?</h4>
<p>My advice is to seek out senior women – it is a useful track. They will help guide you through the organisation. Other than this, I would advise proactively taking on tasks and contributing meaningfully; don’t just speak the speak, but value-add. Everything you say or do is building your brand, so try to represent yourself well, particularly in front of senior management.</p>
<p>People do come to me, and I really enjoy that role. The best leaders cultivate new leaders, and the idea that I could have some influence on someone’s path is really satisfying.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-your-motto-in-life-or-your-greatest-inspiration">What is your motto in life, or your greatest inspiration?</h4>
<p>The America author and activist Helen Keller said: “Life is either daring adventure or nothing at all.” I have found that the most interesting and rewarding parts of my life have been where I’ve had adventures and taken risks. It is easy to get complacent, and although I smile at some of my more ridiculous adventures, this quote motivates me to keep trying new things.</p>

<p><em>Recounting their own career journeys, our Women in Treasury New York Forum panellists proved that treasury attracts an increasingly wide pool of talent, and that diversity and inclusion is improving. In a wide-ranging discussion, the panellists outlined how mentors and inspiring bosses have nurtured their careers and urged women to do more to encourage each other. Elsewhere, the discussion turned to how the pandemic has made networking and forging relationships across companies challenging and discussed how working from home requires a new type of leadership. Ultimately, they delivered an upbeat message that treasury is increasingly a place of diversity and that women must now use their voices to advocate for broader inclusion.</em></p>

<p>Attendees from the US, from the West to the East coast joined Sophie Jackson, Treasury Today’s Co-Publisher &amp; Head of Strategic Content and Meg Coates, Co-Publisher &amp; Head of Operations, alongside expert panellists Deepa Palamuttam, Director of Global Tax and Treasury Technology and Controls, Intel Corporation, Melanie Simmons, Treasury Manager, Corporate Finance, Nitel, Geraldine Yip, Regional Head, Asia Pacific, Sales Practice and Content Management, Global Liquidity and Cash Management, HSBC and Kim Hochfeld, Senior Managing Director, Global Head of Cash, State Street Global Advisors.</p>
<h4 id="treasury-journey">Treasury journey</h4>
<p>The Forum began with the panellists recounting their different career journeys. For Melanie, the move to treasury came when she realised she didn’t want to stay in her existing accounting role. Her rapid rise at Nitel began as a treasury assistant; she made supervisor and is now manager. Geraldine recounted how she joined HSBC’s global liquidity and cash management division via a degree in law and a graduate trainee role at Citi. It is a career trajectory that has given her a front-row seat to the global conversation around diversity and inclusion, she said. “Everyone is unique. I am Chinese and female, but this won’t tell you how I think. I also believe the conversation around inclusion and diversity needs to turn to equality,” she said.</p>
<p>Intel’s Deepa has an engineering background, and also holds an MBA. She told delegates how studying engineering was considered unusual for an Indian woman at the time, and that she faced resistance from her family. “Looking back now, everyone was proud of me but at that point in time, I had to fight,” she said. Explaining that her role involves creating a technology-driven road map for Intel’s treasury department, she said the combination of treasury and technology has proved “her path.” </p>
<h4>Driving diversity</h4>
<p>The panellists reflected on how their organisations are driving diversity. They referenced the importance of focus committees, data and diversity goals with targeted initiatives alongside developing junior talent and providing coaching.</p>
<p>“We regularly publish our diversity statistics,” said Kim. “We insist on having a diverse slate of candidates when we are hiring for a new role. It’s not happening naturally, so we are forcing the issue to ensure that  prospective candidates aren’t exclusively white males.”</p>
<p>Kim said that although progress around diversity is slow, it is happening. One driver is asset managers like State Street Global Advisors insisting on diversity on the Boards of the companies in which they invest. “We are not just doing this to be politically correct; there is enough evidence to show that a diverse Board makes for a better company.” She also stressed the importance of employers “taking a risk” on prospective candidates who don’t necessarily “fit.”</p>
<p>Geraldine stressed the importance of educating managers, particularly around their role in developing younger talent. She also noted enduring challenges for women in treasury like “difficult conversations” around salary, support for working mothers, learning how to network, and seeking sponsorship. Referencing the multinational nature of treasury, she added: “Women have more challenges in articulating  these if English is not their first language.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere Kim noted a new culture at banks, traditionally renowned for not being family-friendly and for testosterone-fuelled trading floors. However, she noted change is slow. “I find it depressing whenever you have a meeting with someone from marketing and HR, they are always a woman.” That said, overall the panellists agreed that banks are “really trying” to ensure women succeed; they’ve acknowledged there is a problem, they are working on fixing it and on measuring progress eg they  are publishing statistics around diversity.</p>
<p>Geraldine added that unconscious bias is held by institutions, as well as individuals. “We have to acknowledge that both institutions and ourselves have these biases, and work out how to overcome them. We all struggle with this conversation,” she said.</p>
<p>Panellists also talked about the importance of fighting stereotypes. Melanie reflected on how different experiences, like negotiating her salary, had taught her to “not think about gender.”  Geraldine also noted how women are often each other’s harshest critics. “Women call other women aggressive,” she said. “We need to stop worrying about what other people might think.” A point Kim noted when she recalled an anecdote from her own career. “Women are women’s worst critics. Think like a man, put away the self-doubt and the voice in your head that questions your opinions.”</p>
<h4 id="networking">Networking</h4>
<p>Next the conversation turned to issues around socialising after work. Despite the importance of networking, it can create awkward hurdles for some. “A lot of networking sessions are happy hours,” said Deepa. “I don’t drink, but I was expected to go.” She recalled how despite “some initial comments,” she was able to explain that she didn’t enjoy these events. It has given her empathy with colleagues who struggle to network through the same forums. “If I am travelling and at a conference, of course I will network but at home it is a different situation.” Here, Melanie reflected that successful company networking events should include a meal and be considerate of commutes and home responsibilities. There shouldn’t be a presumed shared set of normal social practices when expecting people to interact out of hours and people should not be penalised for feeling differently or having other responsibilities.</p>
<p>Networking is just one aspect of working life that throws the spotlight on social issues. Deepa told delegates how as her career has evolved she has broken social taboos around, for example, voicing her opinion. “It took some time to get used to speaking up,” she said, recalling how in many meetings she didn’t think “it was her place” to talk. “Now I am told I am too direct,” she joked.</p>
<p>She also recounted an enduring early career belief that that she should “just do her job,” rather than embrace a wider working life of networking and leadership roles. “I didn’t understand why I should network; it didn’t click,” she said. Recounting how she became comfortable with the process, she urged delegates to view networking like building their own social circle, but also to do it on their own terms.</p>
<h4 id="sponsors-and-mentors">Sponsors and mentors</h4>
<p>Panellists also reflected on the importance of mentors. Although Deepa has never had a mentor she said important conversations have influenced her career. These include advice that her family commitments “would be accommodated” in the job. “Every boss has said something that has made an impact on how I’ve shaped myself,” she said. “I haven’t had a specific female mentor, but every manager has had a lasting impact.”</p>
<p>Geraldine, who has officially only had one mentor through her career, noted the importance of “many people” unofficially helping to guide her career. She spoke about the distinction between mentoring and sponsorship, arguing that sponsorship is more important for career progression. “A mentor is great, but a sponsor is somebody who supports the development of your career and puts themselves on the line for you.” She said a sponsor will often risk their own credibility to give you the opportunity to grow into the job. “I have been fortunate enough to have a few people like this in my life,” she said.</p>
<p>Regarding networking, Deepa advised on the importance of seeking mentorship and sponsorship from outside treasury, in the wider company. Moreover, one of the best ways to facilitate relationship building is to think how to help other parts of the business. “Any meeting is an investment of time,” she said. “Think how they would benefit from listening to you - give them information that would benefit them. I always say create a one-pager for a discussion.”</p>
<p>Melanie added that senior women and black executives were important role models and sources of encouragement for her. “If I work hard enough, I can be a senior leader,” she said. “If you see people of colour in leadership roles it gives you confidence to grow.” Moreover, she agreed that having her boss “in her corner,” and someone who she could talk to about her goals, was paramount.  Kim echoed this point when she said success in treasury required “friends on the journey;” a support network that can include a partner at home as much as a mentor.</p>
<h4 id="working-from-home">Working from home</h4>
<p>Panellists also noted the challenges the pandemic and working from home have brought as well as the impact that the Black Lives Matter movement has had, particularly on black members of staff. At Nitel, the focus is increasingly on how employees feel at this time, said Melanie, who said it was hard for her to focus at times while the pandemic and injustice unravelled in the world outside. She said her company “was listening” and had provided “the tools” for employees to look after themselves. Deepa agreed, noting that she made an extra effort to check-in with team members and urged each employee to champion inclusion.</p>
<p>Kim reflected on the pressure of starting a new role at State Street Global Advisors on the eve of the pandemic. “I had eight days in the office and then we were all sent home,” she recalled, describing the experience as “not for the faint hearted.” With frequent travel between London and her team in Boston on hold, she said building relationships digitally is challenging. Moreover, “knowing where to go internally” in a new company without physical interaction is also difficult. “I miss the casual interactions at my desk and the social side of the office; the impromptu interactions and creativity generated in a meeting,” she said.</p>
<p>Panellists also reflected on how the pandemic and the move to digital communication could damage company cultures. “Building a relationship over zoom is challenging, it supports but doesn’t necessary build relationships. We may end up paying a price in our culture,” said Kim. In today’s challenging times – as always – Deepa urged delegates to hold onto their individuality. “You are unique, focus on being yourself and project confidence even if you don’t feel it. Your culture is the way you are brought up. Remember who you are - this is the inclusion and this is the diversity we are all talking about.”</p>
<p>Melanie reflected that she would like to combine working from home with travelling to the office a few days a week to help with networking and “keep in touch.” She noted that zoom conferences do allow checking in and keeping the networking base going but arent the same as face to face.</p>
<p>The discussions also touched on challenges around motivating colleagues who are not self-starters, and derive motivation from those around them. “As leaders and managers, we need to understand them,” said Kim. “Our remote life does require a different skill than being in an office.”</p>
<h4 id="no-regrets">No regrets</h4>
<p>The discussion closed with panellists reflecting on the best advice they’d ever received. For Melanie it was to ask questions, and to not be afraid of not knowing the answer. “I’ve gotten comfortable with being vulnerable; it allows me to grow and learn,” she said. Kim, quoting Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, urged delegates to act boldly. “Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it,” she said, adding that one of the best pieces of advice she’d received was a reminder that she is paid to voice her opinions. For Deepa it was advice to focus on her next career steps while Geraldine concluded the event with her best piece of learned advice. “Never wonder “what if”; don’t have regrets. I apply this to my day-to-day work, as well as in my big picture career.”</p>

<h4 id="what-has-your-experience-of-moving-to-apac-and-working-with-the-corporate-community-there-taught-you-about-this-industry">What has your experience of moving to APAC and working with the corporate community there taught you about this industry?</h4>
<p>It would  be wrong to say it’s been without stress, but it’s been incredibly rewarding as well. I love the multi-cultural nature of Singapore and the broader APAC region, and I think the treasury community is a fantastic example of that. Each day I get to speak to people from all over the world who are building businesses, expanding the remit of regional treasury centres and, in some cases, acting as global leaders in driving innovation across treasuries. It’s definitely taught me a lot in the relatively short time I’ve been here.</p>
<h4 id="how-have-you-seen-the-conversation-around-female-representation-evolve-and-expand-over-the-course-of-your-career">How have you seen the conversation around female representation evolve and expand over the course of your career?</h4>
<p>When I started my career, there wasn't really a genuine conversation about this that I can remember – or remember being involved with anyway. I think it's really in the last ten years or so that we've started to see far more engagement on the subject of female representation and inclusion and diversity more broadly.</p>
<p>I'm pretty lucky at State Street, as I've had the chance to be involved with a number of initiatives to bring the subject to a much wider audience, for example the work we do with Treasury Today and the Women in Treasury Global Study. I'm proud to work somewhere where we not only have the scale to affect change, but we actually do it. We're walking the walk.</p>
<h4 id="youve-really-supported-inclusion-in-your-role-for-some-time-now-what-advice-would-you-offer-others-looking-to-challenge-bias-and-promote-diversity-in-the-workplace">You've really supported inclusion in your role for some time now, what advice would you offer others looking to challenge bias and promote diversity in the workplace?</h4>
<p>There's always more we can be considering, and everyone has a part to play in that. I would always encourage people to speak up if they see something that doesn’t look right. Or, if something has always been done in a particular way, then to challenge those norms. One of the things that I've found really useful is to educate yourself on the issues and look at some of the data. Since Fearless Girl initiative started the number of companies in the Russell 3000 without a woman on their board has dropped from about 25% to just about 10%, and every company in the S&amp;P500; now has at least one woman on their board.</p>
<p>Whether it's a lack of female representation or exclusionary behaviours and cultures, it's up to everyone to challenge that. You don't just rely on other people to make those changes it has to be a collective effort if we're actually going to see any material differences in the future.</p>
<h4 id="what-further-changes-do-you-hope-to-see-in-the-future-of-the-industry">What further changes do you hope to see in the future of the industry?</h4>
<p>The nirvana state is that we get to a place where we aren't needing to have this conversation and we don't need to have events or panels specifically to further the conversation. That certainly seems to be the overarching theme when we've had these discussions.</p>
<p>Personally, I have two young daughters who, in 20 years' time, are going to be entering the workforce. I'd like to think that they wouldn't have to deal with some of the issues that females face today, like unequal pay, challenges around career progression, or male-dominated sectors.</p>
<p>I think the treasury community in Singapore especially, is actually a pretty unique example in that regard. Singapore especially has such a diverse mix of people, races and cultures, , as well as  a very high proportion of female treasury professionals at all levels, so we need to try and make that diversity the norm across the workplace rather than the exception – and of course not just in treasury either.</p>
<p>Lastly, changes to working practices. They can be made quickly, we only have to look at COVID-19 to see that digital transformation can happen exceptionally rapidly when it's needed, but again, it takes a collective effort to make that change.</p>

<p>Tell me about your professional background and your current role.</p>
<p>I have been in the industry over 23 years. I started in the service side of the industry, where I was identified by a female colleague who was key to my early learning and success. I went on to help build an organisation with her in the conference industry – then later I worked with her again, along with other women mentors, at another organisation, ViaWest, which is where my technology acumen started to grow and mature.</p>
<p>More recently I joined ICD in the money market funds and short-term investments space as Chief Information Officer.</p>
<h4 id="what-are-the-biggest-challenges-that-you-are-currently-facing">What are the biggest challenges that you are currently facing?</h4>
<p>Obviously we are all operating in a COVID-19 environment, which in itself brings new challenges. As a new CIO at ICD, I started immersing myself in all aspects of the company.</p>
<p>One of my key areas of responsibility is supporting the infrastructure for creating the best tools in the industry. I am learning about our clients and the wider community that we operate in. The excitement, the brilliance, and the innovation of the team around me is incredible – it is an exciting space to be in.</p>
<h4 id="what-has-been-your-experience-of-diversity-in-the-workplace?-How-much-progress-have-you-seen-during-your-career">What has been your experience of diversity in the workplace? How much progress have you seen during your career?</h4>
<p>I have seen significant changes throughout the tech industry over the past two decades, especially for women, but it’s not enough. Still, some brilliant women are starting to take seats at the table, which is a lovely thing to see.</p>
<p>I recently joined a CIO group and was pleasantly surprised to see how many other women there are. It’s exciting to see women come together to share ideas and help each other be successful. On a personal level I think that it’s important that I am able to help build up other women in this space.</p>
<h4 id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-women-in-finance-who-are-looking-to-establish-and-develop-a-career">What advice would you give to women in finance who are looking to establish and develop a career?</h4>
<p>Identify the people who can be your mentors and build strong relationships. Realising this at a young age was significant to my own career growth and success. Always make sure that you are surrounded by people who are positive and who push you to grow in different ways.</p>
<p>Your mentors don’t need to be women. I have had some incredibly strong and supportive men as mentors, including our own CEO at ICD, Tory Hazard. And there are specific forums out there now like Women in Treasury, so there are many more avenues that we can pursue as women. I appreciate the opportunity to continue to expand my own support system and work with new mentors. </p>
<h4 id="what-is-your-motto-in-life-or-your-greatest-inspiration">What is your motto in life or your greatest inspiration?</h4>
<p>I love to keep things simple, and also keep things in perspective. And as clichéd as it may sound, no matter what age you are, no matter what industry you may be in, always continue to chase your dreams.</p>
<p>Looking back, I am trying to make sure I give back as much as I have received. If you surround yourself with the right people, then good things will come.</p>

<h4 id="whats-the-biggest-challenge-youre-facing-at-the-moment">What’s the biggest challenge you’re facing at the moment?</h4>
<p>The biggest one at the moment is the urge to be online all the time. When you’re working from home, you feel like you have to be visible and accessible all the time, even though that’s not how we operate in the office.</p>
<p>The other challenge at the moment is building relationships. It can be hard to cultivate a new relationship without needing to connect for something specific. With everyone working from home and balancing so many pressures of their own, it’s hard to ask for more of their time and personal space.</p>
<h4 id="what-has-been-your-experience-of-diversity-and-inclusion-in-the-workplace-and-how-have-you-seen-the-conversation-around-female-representation-evolve-and-expand-over-the-course-of-your-career">What has been your experience of diversity and inclusion in the workplace, and how have you seen the conversation around female representation evolve and expand over the course of your career?</h4>
<p>When I started out in investment management about 20 years ago, it was a very different industry. It was really male-dominated and behaviours at times were unacceptable compared to how we operate today. I felt that I had to be like the rest in order to be included, and I found myself following areas of interest that my male colleagues had, just so that I could connect with them. I even have a set of golf clubs and I never thought that would be a sport that I would take up!</p>
<p>The conversation around female representation was also much more contrived. It was about giving lip service and filling quotas. Today though, it’s a much better environment for everyone. The majority of people truly understand the value of diversity. When I look around now, I see more men at women’s networking events, I see more female leaders generally, and I see more celebrations of achievements for both males and females across the industry.</p>
<h4 id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-others-looking-to-challenge-bias-and-promote-diversity-in-the-workplace">What advice would you give to others looking to challenge bias and promote diversity in the workplace?</h4>
<p>There are two main things. The first is that you can’t argue with facts. There’s a lot of people who are not motivated by beliefs, but rather money, performance and profitability. And there’s a whole world of evidence and hard statistics out there that tell us that diversity of thought and an inclusive culture leads to higher profitability and better outcomes for businesses.</p>
<p>Secondly, embrace your own authenticity. It’s really hard to promote diversity if you can’t embrace yourself, and honesty is really important in that. We look for inspiring leaders all the time in our personal and professional lives, and when those leaders speak out honestly about who they are, it can really inspire others to embrace their differences too.</p>
<p>But also, it’s important to do personal health checks on our self-awareness for things like our own unconscious bias and how we feel about things. It can really help to cement how we’re thinking and how we want to operate, and that can enable us to talk to people about the promotion of diversity in a more meaningful way.</p>
<h4 id="what-further-changes-do-you-hope-to-see-in-the-future-of-the-industry">What further changes do you hope to see in the future of the industry?</h4>
<p>One thing that I’ve always wanted to see more of is flexible and remote working practices in this industry – not because a virus requires it, but because there’s a belief in it. Having talked to numerous male colleagues over the years, many of them have admitted that they’ve suffered from the guilt of missing appointments, assemblies and quality time with friends and family. They’ve said that the push from working mothers that has really taken the conversation about flexible and remote working forward has really helped them. </p>
<p>Additionally, flexible working can take away some of the potential barriers that stop people entering the industry. Remote working could help not just parents, but also people with disabilities who are challenged by commuting long distances but could do the job very effectively at home. I just think flexible working is better for bringing more talent into this industry.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-your-motto-in-life-or-your-greatest-inspiration">What is your motto in life, or your greatest inspiration?</h4>
<p>I don’t really have a saying or a motto, because I find inspiration from so many things and so many people.</p>
<p>But for things that keep me really motivated, the first is to embrace the challenge because it keeps you growing, and it enriches you. I always opt for the harder route because I learn more that way.</p>
<p>The second is to always celebrate your firsts of everything – personally and professionally. Every time you get that first win for something that you’ve been challenged by, celebrate it! It’s easy to get caught up in performance targets and business goals that sometimes feel very out of reach, so celebrating small wins can help remind yourself of the progress you’re making and motivate you to keep going. </p>

<p><em>In a wide-ranging discussion, panellists speaking at the 2020 Women in Treasury London Forum discussed career tips like the importance of sideways, not just vertical, career moves to build experience and they counselled female treasurers to clearly articulate their aspirations. They strongly encouraged female treasury professionals not to be afraid to ask for pay rises and promotions, and also to seize opportunities to work overseas for the diversity of experience it can provide which will pay dividends later in one’s career. Elsewhere, the forum discussed the need to support black colleagues also battling barriers and obstacles in their career progression, discussed how diversity is impeded by the lack of women in middle management positions and noted the rising importance of ESG.</em></p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body">
<p>Attendees from over 15 countries joined Sophie Jackson, Treasury Today’s Publisher &amp; Head of Strategic Content and Meg Coates, Publisher &amp; Head of Operations, alongside expert panellists Tian Song, Senior Treasury Manager, Baker Hughes; Halina Bernard, Head of Treasury, General Motors Africa and Middle East Operations, Dubai UAE; Diane S Reyes, Group General Manager, Global Head of Liquidity and Cash Management, HSBC, and Kim Hochfeld, Senior Managing Director, Global Head of Cash, State Street Global Advisors.</p>
<p>The first pillar of the forum focused on panellists’ own career journeys. Halina described a trajectory spanning early Polish roots and a career in economics. Next came roles in London, New York and Switzerland which led to her current position heading up General Motors Africa and Middle East treasury department in Dubai, a company she joined in 2010. “Everything was a building block to where I am today,” she explained.</p>
<p>Tian said that she didn’t begin her career in treasury but started out as a strategic consultant instead for her first internship. “Treasury in China is not a mature concept at that time,” she said. She turned to treasury following an undergraduate placement with GE that led to joining the company’s graduate programme in China, a process that unearthed her “passion” for corporate finance. GE’s subsequent integration with Baker Hughes led to the establishment of a new treasury team and the opportunity to build procedures from scratch.</p>
<p>Despite progress around the use of metrics and data to measure diversity, Diane flagged the continued need to support women in middle management positions to move into senior roles. She said the solution required nurturing talent and coaching to provide a “funnel” so that when openings arise, qualified women are “on the slate.” She also stressed the importance of targets across recruitment, and said lessons learnt in the quest to improve gender diversity should now be applied to ethnically diverse and black candidates too. “Diversity leads to better decisions and innovative solutions,” she said.</p>
<p>Reflecting further on the importance of diversity, she said it amounts to “bringing your true self to work” and not hiding things out of a fear that it will lead to being treated differently. She added that she hoped her career illustrated to other women in treasury that it was possible “to have a career and have children.</p>
<h4 id="time-abroad">Time abroad</h4>
<p>As for advice on career progression, Kim noted that working abroad helps executives “build more diverse and inclusive teams” because of the experience of “being an outsider.”
Diane also advised attendees to value lateral moves as highly as vertical career progression.  “Some people think every career move has to be vertical,” she said. However, a lateral move “gives the tools,” such as risk management, to make the next vertical move “much more successful.” Halina also noted the importance and value of a sideways career move. “Moving up the ladder is not always the best,” she said, adding that when you move laterally you gain experience that means you ultimately move towards senior finance and C-level  roles faster.</p>
<h4 id="pay-and-promotions">Pay and promotions</h4>
<p>Next the conversation turned to pay rises and promotion for women in treasury.</p>
<p>Kim told delegates struggling with these types of conversation to compare it to other important issues they don’t shy away from confronting. She also said it came down to “challenging boundaries” and flagged that it is easier to negotiate pay “going into a job” rather than wait until it has begun.  Halina said that by pushing for salary increases, women also showed they were “doing their best negotiation on behalf of the company.” Recalling her own request for promotions and pay rises earlier in her career, she said “she was told no” but was later “recognised.”</p>
<h4 id="speak-up">Speak up</h4>
<p>Next the conversation turned to the importance of speaking up. Diane noted that speaking up either formally or informally is a priority at HSBC. “It is a huge area we are focusing on,” she said. Noting it was possible to speak up “without being arrogant,” she explained how she had missed an opportunity earlier in her career by not voicing her aspirations. She also urged female treasury professionals to volunteer to help others across the company so people can see you “upfront and close.” She added: “People remember you when you have done something for them.”</p>
<p>Tian voiced her own experiences of adapting to a new environment and culture. Noting that relocating and taking on a new intensive job at the same time was challenging, she advised against doing both together. Recalling the challenge of understanding British and Italian accents in her first oversea job outside of China, she urged others to “go with” such cultural obstacles and “not panic,” also noting that building relationships with colleagues with different cultural references took time. However, her business English soon improved, and she “connected” and built friendships with colleagues overtime.</p>
<p>Kim also noted the challenges of being a foreigner and a woman in a male dominated industry. She recalled “having to work harder” to build connections, but noted she challenged her own preconceptions in the process. “I hope it has made me better at listening and taking on other peoples’ suggestions and ideas,” she said. “Being an outsider forces you to stop and think more inclusively and embrace diversity.”</p>
<p>The panellists also reflected on today’s new working environment. For Diane this has brought an appreciation for “soft skills,” an awareness of wellness amongst colleagues and a fresh emphasis on “what matters”.</p>
<p>In one upside, Kim said working from home had made it easier to connect with treasury teams overseas in a “more seamless manner.” She is spending less time travelling and noted that the pandemic has been an “equaliser” in treasury from a geographic perspective.</p>
<h4 id="getting-noticed">Getting noticed</h4>
<p>Diane also noted that remote working and zoom conference calls “are equalizer.” She urged treasury professionals to ensure they are included in zoom calls and carve out an opportunity to chat. For those seeking to get noticed and build their brand, she advised practising their “elevator pitch” to advertise their skills and ability to help across the company. She said employees should practise public speaking and noted that “many great” CEOs have taken coaching.</p>
<p>Halina noted that treasury has become much more visible in recent years. She said liquidity, cash management and strategy has been pushed centre stage and treasury has grown in sophistication. She also noted the focus on automation, and new treasury requirements around KYC and regulation. “You need to spend more time managing this activity,” she added. “Nowadays if there is an ongoing discussion, treasury has to be part of it from the beginning.” She said COVID-19 has put more emphasis on overall risk management and ensuring technology is working safely. “There has been a big acceleration in moving away from paper to digital.”</p>
<p>Kim noted that State Street Global Advisors now asks all the companies it owns to publicly publish their strategy on ethnic and racial diversity. She said women, armed with the personal experience of being a minority, must appreciate and try and understand the position of black colleagues, urging attendees to not stand by but “embrace and talk about” the challenges and obstacles faced by black colleagues.</p>
<h4 id="esg">ESG</h4>
<p>In a final note, Baker Hughes’ Tian said that ESG was becoming much more of a priority in treasury as banks increasingly reference ESG in their lending decisions. “Banks ask us about ESG commitment and propose to include a green solution in our revolving facilities. They also discuss pricing linked to ESG achievements. It’s being taken more seriously by debt / equity investors as well and its being pushed down to the companies impacted.”</p>

<h4 id="how-did-you-get-to-your-current-position">How did you get to your current position?</h4>
<p>I’ve been in banking over 20 years. I joined Wells Fargo 13 years ago and established their global team in Dublin, focusing on European corporates with US operations. About six years ago I came to the US and had the opportunity to join their Technology, Media &amp; Telecom, Corporate Investment Banking division.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-the-biggest-challenge-you-are-currently-facing">What is the biggest challenge you are currently facing?</h4>
<p>Without a doubt it is COVID-19, and how it impacts not only our business but our team members and clients as well. But compared to other sectors, I would say that TMT (Technology, Media &amp; Telecom) is faring very well, especially IT services.</p>
<p>When I left the office I thought that I would see everybody in two to three weeks. Working from home can be hard in a small apartment not designed for the purpose – and we all miss the contact with clients. It’s hard to build new relationships and grow your business when you don’t have the opportunity to network, build rapport and have that face-to-face meeting. But we are all adapting.</p>
<h4 id="whathasbeenyourexperienceofdiversityintheworkplacehowmuchprogresshaveyouseenduringyourcareer">What has been your experience of diversity in the workplace? How much progress have you seen during your career?</h4>
<p>So much has changed and we have moved a long way. At Wells Fargo we ensure that when we go to campuses, we recruit a diverse intake of graduates. But I would say that in companies in both Europe and the US, the number of women getting to senior levels is still not as high as it should be, and people of diverse ethnicities are not progressing as far as they should. It’s on all of us and our companies to be proactive in addressing this.</p>
<h4 id="in-terms-of-establishing-and-developing-a-career,-what-advice-would-you-give-to-women-in-finance">In terms of establishing and developing a career, what advice would you give to women in finance?</h4>
<p>Take ownership of your career. Junior people tend to think that if they keep their heads down and work really hard, they will get rewarded. But you need to plan your development consciously – talk to your manager and cultivate mentors and sponsors. Work out what your aspirations are and then get feedback about the skills that you need to develop.</p>
<p>It's so important to build and maintain your network and connections. And when you move to a different team, don’t burn your bridges. A former manager could become a great sponsor.</p>
<p>I would also say that progression is rarely linear. When someone starts out in their career, they tend to see it as a ladder. But there can be great opportunities for learning and development by moving sideways into different roles, gaining knowledge and broadening skills.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-your-motto-in-life-or-your-greatest-inspiration">What is your motto in life or your greatest inspiration?</h4>
<p>I think my motto would have to be ‘every day is a school day’. Finish your day a tiny bit more knowledgeable than you started it, and always be curious. This doesn’t just mean gaining technical knowledge – it’s important to take all opportunities to gain knowledge. The US is a huge country but during our time here my husband and I have tried to visit every state. We are up to 48, and it would have been 50 if COVID-19 had not intervened. These trips have enabled us to see the US from many perspectives.</p>

<h4 id="tell-us-how-you-arrived-at-your-current-role">Tell us how you arrived at your current role.</h4>
<p>When I got my Master’s degree in Business Administration, I was based in Pennsylvania, and secured an opportunity at Mellon Bank. From there I moved to New York, where I worked at J.P. Morgan, then Citi and now HSBC. All of those assignments started in transaction banking, which I really have a passion for. I refer to myself as a ‘transaction banking lifer’ – in a positive sense, of course!</p>
<p>I moved to HSBC because I was looking to run an end-to-end product business and I wanted to be the executive in charge. I wanted to come in and run a business where I could create ideas from a strategic perspective, including the design of products, selling or distributing the products, risk mitigation and protecting the bank from any harm that could possibly come – as well as having a financial responsibility for the P&amp;L.;</p>
<h4 id="how-do-you-think-the-conversation-around-diversity-and-inclusion-has-changed">How do you think the conversation around diversity and inclusion has changed?</h4>
<p>I’m definitely positive about the progress we’ve made as an industry, but there’s always more to do. I also think it’s important that we don’t stop at gender, and we focus on every aspect of diversity and inclusion. A big area for us is ethnic diversity, and we need initiatives that allow us to take action, using successful lessons from our female inclusion work. </p>
<p>Would you say it’s more important to have a defined career plan or to be open and flexible?
 I would say a little bit of both. If you want to go somewhere, you need to figure out what opportunities will help you get there, or deter you. But you shouldn’t be so firm that you won’t take a position unless it’s exactly the direction that you want. Being flexible allows you to explore things that you otherwise might not have done, and that may be lateral moves instead. Some people spend so long planning every micro-detail, they can then never execute on their plan because it’s too specific and unreasonable.</p>

<p>My greatest inspiration is my father. I’m one of seven children, and he worked full time as a career businessman whilst raising us. He was always the greatest example of working hard and he taught me to be a force of resilience. </p>
<p>My motto is simple: practise, practise, practise. Too many people want something, but they don’t prepare for it, they don’t practise their elevator pitch, or what to say in an interview. If you don’t practise, you’ll forget what it is you wanted to say, and you’ll sound unnatural and insincere. There’s nothing to be embarrassed about practising, it just delivers greater results.</p>
<h4 id="speaking-up">Speaking up</h4>
<p>As a mother to four children, all of working age, Diane has experienced first-hand how the younger generation is shaking up the workplace. “They do things very differently, and they can educate us about what’s changing in the world,” she says. Additionally, she’s found that this generation has a very strong moral compass, and often don’t have concerns about speaking up. “As leaders we need to be the receivers of this new ‘speak up’ culture, and accept it and act on it.”</p>
<p>This can be especially true for women in finance that are looking to establish and develop a career. For Diane, this is something she feels she has learned the hard way. “If you don’t tell people where you want to go, they’ll make assumptions,” she says. Managers can often have up to 20 direct reports, so they may not know everyone’s individual career ambitions. Therefore, she says it’s important to raise your hand and ask for opportunities and explain the desired direction.</p>
<p>Additionally, Diane notes the importance of companies offering formal mentorship and sponsorship programmes. At HSBC, she sponsors the Accelerating into Leadership programme where, if they meet the performance criteria, women are taught the necessary skills to move further up in the company. The mentoring and sponsoring experience does, for many women, allow a focus on getting their voices heard in one-on-one situations with a senior employee, as well as in a broader context. “I think it’s about giving people the experience to know how to handle a boss, how to handle a difficult conversation, and how to go to people for counselling and advice,” she says. In fact, she adds, when the time comes for performance reviews, the bank’s HR department often gets involved to encourage all staff to be comfortable when reminding their managers what they’ve accomplished.</p>
<h4 id="strive-for-improvement">Strive for improvement</h4>
<p>A global pandemic isn’t the most ideal of circumstances for many companies – and for Diane, it’s no different. She’s learned two main lessons throughout the period: resilience and empathy.</p>
<p>Diane notes that like many, she has been working even longer hours since working from home, as well as taking fewer – if any – breaks, and as such has had to focus on resilience – both physical and mental. “I’d be getting headaches because I hadn’t taken a break or eaten all day,” she says. To combat this, she began scheduling in lunch and exercise breaks to “re-energise and re-invigorate” herself. “I went for walks around my neighbourhood, and saw it from a totally different angle! I saw animals I’d never seen around before, and I learned that I live near some water that you can’t even see from the road.”</p>
<p>For empathy, Diane found it came from the ‘check-in calls’ with her team. “These are not about business, but about asking how everyone is doing,” she says. It was two months in when a team member realised that Diane always checked how everyone else was, but never shared how she was doing. “I didn’t expect it, but I decided I was going to be vulnerable and tell him that my sister-in-law had been in intensive care for a while and that it was very serious.” It’s this vulnerability that Diane thinks makes better leaders. “It shows humanity, and as a team, we become closer,” she says.</p>
<p>When not staring in the face of a global pandemic, Diane is a keen advocate for targets in the diversity and inclusion space. “The reason I’m a fan of targets is because you won’t know if you’re making progress if you don’t have a tangible metric to focus on,” she explains.</p>
<p>It’s all well and good having conversations around the topic, but if in five years’ time there’s still no progress with hiring or promoting minority candidates, then the conversations would not have been very helpful. The benefits of having diverse teams is that this allows for diversity of thought, broader skillsets and backgrounds that can help HSBC offer better solutions to its customers. As Diane explains, the customers make the bank. “I’ve seen a positive difference when we’ve implemented targets and included them on management scorecards,” she says. “They are an important part of building the right culture, where people are included and where they can speak up, which is what enables you to deliver the best outcomes for your customers.”</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body">
<p>The 2020 Women in Treasury APAC Forum kicked off with Sophie Jackson, Joint Publisher and Head of Strategic Content, sharing some early insights from the 2020 Women in Treasury Global Study. Attendees were treated to ‘hot off the press’ data around parity, inclusion and representation.</p>
<p>Meg Coates, Joint Publisher and Head of Operations, sharing details of attendee demographics, highlighted that the virtual event delivery now allowed for women and male allies in treasury from across the Asia Pacific region to attend. Virtual delivery in this instance enabled the community to come together, bringing together people that may seldom be in the same physical space.</p>
<p>The panel discussion, moderated by Sophie Jackson, was laid out in an agenda, shared with attendees which consisted of three broad pillars of discussion tackled by the following heavyweight panel speakers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tiana Sheridan, Vice President, Sales &amp; Relationship Manager, Cash Management, BlackRock.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seng Ti Goh, Senior General Manager, Finance &amp; Administration, Isuzu Motors Asia Ltd and President, Association of Corporate Treasurers (Singapore).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rashmi Joshi, CFO and Whole Time Director, Castrol India.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aigerim Bekzhanova, Business Controller, Vanderlande.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="career-advancement-in-finance">Career advancement in finance</h4>
<p>The first pillar focused on finance as a profession, probing issues of how to get ahead. Rashmi set about explaining her career path. She described her path as a long journey, where she knew that she wanted to be a CFO upon first qualifying as a Chartered Accountant in the late 1980s. Hers was not an isolated aspiration. In an audience poll, 40% of attendees said they were aspiring to be a CFO, and it was noted that the path from treasurer to CFO has become a lot more defined as the treasury role has become more strategic.</p>
<p>Rashmi continued, explaining that although a driving force for her was her “strong will”, her support system both at home and work was also key to her success. “Being able to get the required help and support from immediate family and extended family is something a woman needs to do if she wants to take on more responsibilities in her career,” she said. “My parents, my in-laws, my husband; all of them have supported me a lot.”</p>
<p>Professionally, she feels that support from colleagues and seniors is also needed. Rashmi, who told the audience that she had very recently become a grandmother, reported that Castrol has given her the space to work flexibly so she could assist her daughter and grandson who were staying with her. “If you really want to employ diversity and support women, then you really have to create this flexible environment,” she said.</p>
<h4 id="mentoring-remotely">Mentoring remotely</h4>
<p>On the subject of professional support, guest, Sonia Clifton-Bligh, Director, Regional Treasury Services Centre Asia Pacificat Johnson &amp; Johnson, asked how, in a remote working environment, can mentees and mentors, find one another and establish a relationship?</p>
<p>As both a mentee and a mentor, Tiana has found that the most successful mentorships have come from reaching out to her managers at the time. “They often face off with more senior individuals than I might on a day-to-day basis, and given how well they know me, I think there’s no harm in asking someone to put you forward or suggest some names,” she explained.</p>
<p>Rashmi added that the move to virtual meetings for the largely foreseeable future also has some significant benefits, not least being much wider access to mentors online. “You get more variety of experiences and backgrounds and cultures, and you don’t have to restrict yourself to certain people,” she said. Video meetings can be just as effective as in-person, she believes, as you can still read expressions and body language.</p>
<h4 id="diversity-inclusion-and-allyship">Diversity, inclusion and allyship</h4>
<p>Inclusion and diversity are issues that are incredibly close to the hearts of the Women in Treasury community, evidenced by another poll during the event. 76% of attendees said that D&amp;I; was “very important” to them, whilst 20% ranked it as “somewhat important”.</p>
<p>This second pillar was opened up by Aigerim Bekzhanova. Featured in the March/April edition of Treasury Today Asia in a <a href="https://treasurytoday.com/women-in-treasury/articles/aigerim-bekzhanova-vanderlande">This Much I Know</a> profile, Aigerim is passionate about female representation. Being from Kazakhstan and having experienced a “hierarchical and masculine environment”, she has encountered a few challenges in her professional life. “I had to set ambitious goals from the beginning, because the outlook in society was that at some point I’d shift to be with a family,” she explained.</p>
<p>Key to realising her goals was her education, first with a Bachelor’s degree from an international university in her home country, before journeying to Scotland for her Master’s degree in Accounting and Finance. It was the support of both male and female leaders that encouraged Aigerim to aim high and push through societal barriers. “If I didn’t have that experience of diversity and inclusion, I wouldn’t be here right now talking about my journey,” she said.</p>
<p>Tiana also noted the importance of sustaining the conversation around inclusion. “When you look at diversity, you’re looking at representation. But when you look at inclusion, you’re looking at how to embrace those differences, those distinguishing attributes of each person,” she explained. Last time she counted, at BlackRock, she says there were eight different affinity networks, which she believes are critical when trying to support minority groups. “They range from veterans, to women, families, black professionals, and more recently the abilities network.” Creating a safe space for people to share experiences encourages employees to connect, which in turn promotes increased productivity.</p>
<h4 id="best-practice-and-top-tips">Best practice and top tips</h4>
<p>The third and final pillar was opened by Seng Ti Goh, who explained that being an inclusive treasury leader should not be just “rhetoric, or being politically correct”. Instead, he said, “you have to really believe it, and it has to come from within. People are discerning, and they will know the difference.” There are three key things he’s learned on his journey. The first is the difference between hearing and listening. “You have to listen using your heart, not only having an understanding but also developing empathy,” he explained.</p>
<p>The second is to appreciate the importance of collaboration. “Unless you are on the track competing in the 100m sprint, you cannot achieve targets alone. And we are all working in teams – not as individuals,” he said. Lastly, is to accept that the world is likely to be a multiverse. “It’s not singular, it’s not bipolar, it’s most likely multiverse, and people come with different ethnic, racial and sexual profiles; different orientations, personalities and beliefs; different educational and social backgrounds; and you just have to accept that and appreciate that it is this differentiation that makes the world a better, nicer and more beautiful place.”</p>
<p>When it comes to top tips for women in the workplace, Tiana has learnt to have conviction in the things she believes in. “If you don’t believe it, then why should anyone else?” she said. Other key lessons were learnt from joining a ‘Taking the Stage’ programme, covered in more detail in Tiana’s <a href="https://treasurytoday.com/women-in-treasury/articles/tiana-sheridan-blackrock">This Much I Know profile</a>.</p>
<p>Aigerim similarly felt that it’s important to be true to yourself, and also not to be afraid to show vulnerability. “It takes a lot of courage to be true to yourself, especially in a dynamically changing environment,” she said. On being vulnerable, she explained that it actually encourages closer bonds with colleagues. “We’re all on the same team and we’re struggling through the same times.”</p>
<h4 id="staying-visible">Staying visible</h4>
<p>Final guest, Toni Webber, Group Finance Director, interTouch Pte Ltd, asked the all-important question: with everyone working from home, how do you ensure you stay visible?</p>
<p>Tiana believes the answer is direct interaction. “Map out who you think are the most important stakeholders internally, who you need to maintain that exposure with, and set up regular updates,” she advised. These updates could be weekly, fortnightly or monthly, but it’s important to stay up to date and keep them up to date on individual accomplishments.</p>
<p>For Seng Ti, he shares the “Three Rs” that are noteworthy:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Relevance</strong>: we tend to digress and send convoluted emails. We should be mindful of that and keep out answers sharp and relevant. Be straightforward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Responsive</strong>: if there’s a call to action or a deadline, whether you can meet it or not, you have to respond. “Don’t just go MIA and leave others hanging.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Respectful</strong>: it’s important to be respectful of the audience and understand the value of their time. “You can’t write an email in the middle of the night and expect an answer, neither should you expect others to follow the same schedule as yourself – they might be busy with their boss or family.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="a-digital-success">A digital success</h4>
<p>In lieu of a physical event allowing for attendees to network, a virtual chat room was kept open for attendees to interact with one another. As companies adjust to working from home and delivering digital events, it has become evident that they can be just as successful as physical ones.</p>
<p>The Women in Treasury community is committed to maintaining an open dialogue around inclusion and diversity, providing a platform for all those who want to be involved. This most recent forum proved that coming together digitally can be incredibly powerful and that staying connected is critical in challenging moments.</p>

<p>Sandra Ramos-Alves is Vice President and Assistant Treasurer, Treasury Operations at Bristol Myers Squibb, based in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Sandra has a Bachelor’s degree in Accounting and Spanish from Rutgers University and a Master’s degree in Accounting from Babson F.W. Olin Graduate School of Business, with a concentration in Strategic Cost Management and Entrepreneurial Finance. She is also a certified public accountant.</p>
<p>With a distinguished career which extends beyond finance, Sandra’s hard work was recognised in 2013 when she was nominated for the HBA Rising Star Award at her company at the time, Celgene – later acquired by Bristol Myers Squibb, where she still works. Progressing from Director, International Treasury and Foreign Exchange to Executive Director &amp; Assistant Treasurer, Sandra is dedicated to giving back to the treasury community. In 2019, her efforts were once again recognised at Celgene’s internal awards when she was nominated for Mentor of the Year.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body">
<h4 id="tell-us-about-your-career-path-why-treasury">Tell us about your career path. Why treasury?</h4>
<p>I began my career in finance at Lucent Technologies, first through its financial leadership development programme, and then by being the Internal Audit Manager for the Caribbean and Latin America region.</p>
<p>Following an 18-month assignment in Campinas, Brazil, I moved to treasury when Lucent Technologies’ Regional Treasurer for Latin America stepped down and the FX manager took up the role. My experience in Latin America, and proficiency in both Portuguese and Spanish, made me an ideal candidate to take up the role of FX and Money Markets Manager.</p>
<p>After a three-year role at Cendant, I received a call about an opportunity at a small biotech company, Celgene, to help build an international treasury and FX function. I spent the first eight years in international and FX, and then transitioned to capital markets, where I spent six years working on optimal capital structure, capital allocation, debt financing, managing the credit facility and building relationships with the bank group and the rating agencies. Celgene was acquired by Bristol Myers Squibb in November 2019 and I am now taking the lead in managing global treasury operations.</p>
<p>What’s fun about treasury is that every day is different. Market dynamics drive whether you execute transactions, whether you execute FX or interest rate derivatives, or even share repurchases. Each day is dynamic, and you are in a position to really deliver value and actual P&amp;L impact for the organisation.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-your-next-major-objective">What is your next major objective?</h4>
<p>From a professional standpoint, technology is continuously evolving. We need to assess how we transform our operations with robotics and artificial intelligence to further enhance and streamline our processes, while maintaining a strong control environment.</p>
<p>Personally, my goal is to obtain an optimal work/life balance. I need to continuously focus on balancing my career and my family, as, while they have always been my top priority, I’ve definitely sacrificed my family life over the years.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-the-best-piece-of-advice-that-you-have-been-given-in-your-career-so-far">What is the best piece of advice that you have been given in your career so far?</h4>
<p>If you really want something in your career, you must ask for it. People may not know what your goals are, so you must verbalise and ask for things. We each own our careers and we must be proactive to achieve our goals.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-your-motto-in-life-or-your-greatest-inspiration">What is your motto in life, or your greatest inspiration?</h4>
<p>“Leaders become great, not because of their power, but because of their ability to empower others.” I truly believe that empowering individuals on your team drives the desire to succeed, which ultimately leads to organisational success.</p>
<h4 id="breaking-down-barriers">Breaking down barriers</h4>
<p>Sandra believes that positive steps are being made in furthering diversity and inclusion, and that this is allowing women to flourish and make their voices heard.</p>
<p>“In my experience, I have always felt that expectations of me were higher, so I always approached it like I had to work harder than my male peers,” says Sandra. “A tactic that I’ve used to empower myself to speak up has been to obtain knowledge on any particular topic to command respect in a room and to break down any gender barriers.”</p>
<p>The way junior professionals can go about gaining that knowledge is not limited to professional qualifications. Sandra also encourages individuals to explore the immense benefits of networking. “It really is crucial for growing in your career,” she says. Networking can lead to valuable mentorships, and often, the next growth opportunity may come through a network. Likewise, as an individual moves up the proverbial food chain and is looking to hire staff, a network of good relationships can be used to find good candidates.</p>
<p>Mentoring is something that Sandra is very familiar with – and passionate about. In the nominations for Celgene’s 2019 Mentor of the Year award, Sandra’s honesty, empathy and selflessness were highlighted as key attributes that make her both an excellent manager and mentor figure for many within the organisation. She doesn’t think it takes anything special to do this though, as she notes: “The mentor of the year nomination was truly a surprise. I care about my team’s performance and well-being; I simply treat them with fairness, kindness, and respect, and so I was humbled by the recommendation.”</p>
<p>She also believes it’s important to challenge the status quo. “Look at how things are being done, and how to improve or streamline them, while being really strategic and thoughtful in execution,” Sandra advises. Of course, teamwork is critical to getting the job done the best way possible: having access to a diverse range of ideas generally drives the optimal output.</p>
<p>This teamwork, she adds, must go beyond the treasury team alone and extend to partnering with the organisation to show how value can be delivered. Gone are the days of treasury being unobtainable in an ivory tower – which means that treasurers must now work to get their voices better heard in the organisation. “Treasury should be aligning strategically, thinking about the future of the company and supporting the business needs,” says Sandra. This could be through determining the optimal use of the balance sheet: either investing in additional business development or deleveraging, and the rating agency metric implications of doing so.</p>

<p>Gaining treasury-specific knowledge isn’t the only thing that Sandra believes is important. Having made the switch to treasury operations in November 2019, the challenges she is currently facing are different to the ones she’s had for the past 18 years in front office roles. “I’m really learning about the nuts and bolts, and I think this will help me grow and make a more well-rounded treasury professional,” she says.</p>
<p>For others looking to progress, Sandra believes it’s important to step outside of the comfort zone. “It’s one of the best learning opportunities anyone can have. When I look back, had I pursued some opportunities outside of treasury earlier, I would have benefited from learning the business in a different way and developed new skills that would have been valuable in the long run.”</p>
<p>She recognises, though, that taking on new roles isn’t always an option, and that she’s noticed women often get comfortable in a role when they know they have to balance work with family. “Sometimes you stay in a role longer than you should because you don’t want to disturb family dynamics – in my experience, this is less of a dilemma for men, as they generally have partners to help with the care of the family,” she explains.</p>
<p>Overall, however difficult juggling personal and professional gender roles can be, Sandra is positive that the right steps are being made. In particular, she hopes that the recent focus on home working – and just how possible it is – could pave the way to more flexibility in the future.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4>Tell us how you got to your current position.</h4>
<p>I started at Midland Bank International, which was later taken over by HSBC. At the time, you didn’t see many women managers, let alone women in the boardroom, but I was determined to make my mark.</p>
<p>I moved to Citi afterwards, and I’ve been here for 20 years now. Ten years ago, I was appointed Managing Director, and today my role is to manage the energy and power sector in EMEA in the Treasury and Trade Solutions sales part of the bank.</p>
<h4>What’s the biggest challenge you’re facing at the moment?</h4>
<p>In the energy and power sector, it’s the dramatic fall in oil prices and reduced demand. It’s completely re-writing the playbook for both energy and power companies. We’ve also seen a lot of fraudsters being very active due to supply chain disruption, so we’ve been helping a lot of clients be more aware of that activity.</p>
<p>On a more general, professional level, working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. The lack of connection with people, the inability to have a chat around the coffee machine, or just have a quick brainstorm with someone. We do use video-conferencing, but the informal interactions are much more difficult. Our juniors are also finding this challenging, as you simply can’t learn business over Zoom.</p>
<h4>What has been your experience of diversity in the workplace?</h4>
<p>I’ve been in meetings at Citi where there have been about 20 people around the table, with  20 different nationalities and cultures. Citi has a very open attitude to diversity, which I think probably comes from being such a global firm. I also see that there are more women MDs now, and I didn’t really see that when I first started work.</p>
<h4>What advice would you give to women in finance in terms of establishing and developing a career?</h4>
<p>Put your hand up and get involved in any projects or initiatives outside of your day job and your comfort zone.</p>
<p>You’re not going to get anywhere by just doing the bare minimum; your profile is important and you have to be noticed. Part of that is having an opinion and being open, but there’s an old saying: “Two ears and one mouth: use them in proportion”. So have an opinion, but also listen in proportion and be open to new ideas and initiatives.</p>
<p>Also, always do your best. Put 120% into anything. And of course, make sure you’re enjoying what you do. You’re at work more than you’re at play, so it’s important that you actually like what you’re doing.</p>
<h4>What is your motto in life, or your greatest inspiration?</h4>
<p>Two and a half years ago, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. For me, it was a big reset button. But I learned that there is a future after diagnosis, and you have to really get the most out of life and do things you really enjoy.</p>
<p>My greatest inspiration is my Auntie Lily. She’s just turned 90-years-old, and she’s still dancing! Her attitude is be positive, and keep a sense of humour, so that’s always been my motto, really.</p></div>

<p>Based in Hong Kong, Tiana Sheridan leads the distribution of Cash &amp; Liquidity solutions in APAC at BlackRock. She studied Economics and Finance at the University of Limerick in her home country of Ireland.</p>
<p>Since making the move to Hong Kong in January 2019, Tiana has discovered a passion for hiking, and has travelled to several Asian countries including China, Japan, Singapore and South Korea – though there are plenty more on her to-do list.</p>
<p>Having only been in Asia for 18 months, Tiana is keen to learn and achieve more in the rapidly progressing region.</p>
<p>Through BlackRock’s affiliation with the Tusk Trust, Tiana was due to run her first half marathon in Kenya recently, but unfortunately the COVID-19 pandemic meant it was postponed. She’s excited for next year, when it will hopefully go ahead.</p>
</div></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4>Tell us how you got to your current position.</h4>
<p>I graduated from university with a Bachelor’s degree in Economics and Finance, and started working at Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) as a European Shareholder Services Analyst. As part of that role I supported their liquidity portal, which hosted BlackRock’s money market funds. This is where I became familiar with the BlackRock team and ultimately ended up applying for a sales role.</p>
<p>Prior to this, I had never considered a sales role as the prospect of sales targets and KPIs was slightly daunting. However, at the time I was a little concerned about being pigeonholed, gaining experience in sales would provide me with a more transferable skill set.</p>
<h4>What would you say is the biggest challenge that you’re facing right now?</h4>
<p>I don’t think you can answer this question without referencing COVID-19. The impact has brought its own pressures, both personally and professionally. I work from Hong Kong but cover all of Asia. Trying to conduct any new business is difficult when clients have to prioritise conducting routine processes remotely.</p>
<p>Personally, there are definitely days where I feel far away from home; home being Ireland. COVID-19 has certainly exacerbated that. But I’m fortunate to be working at a firm that has been exceptional in taking care of its employees through this time. We’ve had everything from access to mindfulness apps to morale boosters from different team engagements as we make an effort to check-in on one another regularly. In addition we’ve been granted ‘switch off’ days, which I think is a pretty remarkable gesture from the firm during these challenging times.</p>
<h4>What advice would you give to women in finance in terms of establishing and developing a career?</h4>
<p>Put your hand up and don’t wait to be asked. I certainly wouldn’t be in Asia if I hadn’t put my hand up.</p>
<p>Secondly, take risks. Move jobs, learn more, and become more valuable.</p>
<h4>What is your motto in life, or your greatest inspiration?</h4>
<p>The one that jumps out at me is “what’s for you won’t pass you”, because my mother has always repeated that to me growing up.</p>
<p>Personally though, I’ve always loved the poem The Dash by Linda Ellis. It’s actually quite a sad poem, but through it I’ve found the motto ‘enjoy the dash’. It just reminds me that life is very fragile and we just have to make the most of this.</p>
<h4>Find your voice and silence the Crow</h4>
<p>When it comes to being a female in the workplace, Tiana feels like her voice has always been heard and has always worked in teams that are gender diverse with a minimum of 50% women. However, it is evident that in most companies you do see fewer woman in more senior positions.</p>
<p>This does put an onus on women in senior positions to be more vocal, whether that’s through panels or internal networks. “Every woman has a duty to make sure the voices of other women especially those more junior are being heard, and giving them that platform and opportunity,” she says. This could be as small as asking a junior team member their opinion in a meeting, mentoring, empowering a female colleague, or giving credit to other women in order to share successes.</p>
<p>Tiana concedes that finding her voice is always a work in progress. “I believe everyone has a responsibility to clearly communicate in an appropriate manner how they feel in their role, and actively participate in how that develops over time,” she says. “It’s ultimately to everyone’s benefit if that communication is really open – even if it’s not always the easiest conversation to have.”</p>
<p>When it comes to gaining that necessary confidence, Tiana refers to a development programme she took part in in 2019, called Taking the Stage. “There was a lot of discussion around ‘the Crow’, and some definite good advice is to give the Crow as little airtime as possible.” The Crow, she explains, is the negative voice in the back of your head. “That voice can unnerve you and knock you off kilter when you focus on it for too long - silence the Crow!”</p>
<p>The same development programme focused largely on women in the workplace, and taking ownership of presence, brand and purpose. “I found that I suffer from ‘word obesity’, meaning that I add lots of words that dilute my message. It could be a lot of ‘I think’, ‘I just’ or ‘maybe if…’, so now I go back over my emails and remove anything that doesn’t add value,” she explains. These small tips and tricks can make drastic changes in the way that people communicate.</p>
<h4>Reverse mentoring and empowerment</h4>
<p>There’s been a recent increase in companies exploring the concept of reverse mentoring, which Tiana says has had a positive impact at BlackRock. “With reverse mentoring programmes, you have a really great opportunity to have more informal and healthy dialogues with senior individuals, whereby you can positively influence their thoughts and approaches to different topics,” she explains.</p>
<p>As a member of the People and Culture Committee, Tiana has helped to coordinate and arrange reverse mentoring placements. In doing so, she actively tries to pair mentors and mentees from different teams, to connect those who may not naturally connect during their day-to-day duties. This approach can reap even more benefits owing to the often completely different perspectives.</p>
<p>Alongside mentorships, Tiana notes that BlackRock has a focus on affinity networks. These networks are gaining traction as they allow all employees to gain exposure to the unique backgrounds, experiences and perspectives of their peers. “There are always new ones being established, but if there isn’t one that caters to you, then start one,” she concludes.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><h4>Tell us about your career path. Why treasury?</h4>
<p>I started out in computer engineering, but got involved in accounting as well. I was going to school and at the same time, I had to work because I needed a source of income as a young mother. I got a position at Ernst &amp; Young in their property tax division, where I stayed for about a year before moving to their income tax division. That gave me a start into the finance profession.</p>
<p>From there I moved over to the Flying Food Group in 2005 as an entry-level Treasury Clerk and worked my way up to Treasurer, which took me about ten years.</p>
<p>Why treasury? I like numbers and I’m really good at it. I like the front-end, too. I started out, when I was a Treasury Clerk, in the accounting group. It involved balancing, general and administrative expense allocation transactions, a lot of the back-end. I prefer the front-end because of the interaction with people and physically seeing that I make a difference.</p>
<h4>As a corporate treasurer, what is the biggest challenge that you’re currently facing?</h4>
<p>I would say cyber-fraud and change management. As we get larger, there are more and more attempts to try and infiltrate our organisation.</p>
<p>Our business has also grown exponentially. Getting the culture to be able to accept that change and get onboard is a challenge, because change always encounters some type of resistance. If you don’t get the right individuals onboard, it takes longer to fully integrate change.</p>
<h4>What’s the best piece of advice that you’ve been given in your career so far?</h4>
<p>Do it afraid. Our biggest challenge is ‘what if I fail? What if I don’t?’ You’re going to fail. Understand that when you fail, you just have to keep trying and do your best. Come with your best game, come with the best you.</p>
<h4>Looking back, is there anything that you wish you’d done differently?</h4>
<p>As far as my career path is concerned, I wouldn’t change the experiences I’ve had. I learned from all of them and they helped develop me into the person I am today. I started out in admin – that helped me become organised, gave me the ability to find the tools to get the answers and made me think critically.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I wish I knew some of the things I know now, sooner. I feel like I would be in an even better place now.</p>
<h4>What is your motto in life?</h4>
<p>Be you, not them. Be you, be yourself.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><h4 id="helping-others">Helping others</h4>
<p>For Angela, encouraging others has always come naturally. “As a little girl, I was an all-in-one fashionista and hair stylist,” she explains. “I would spend lots of time with my friends, customising their natural look, making hair colours in unique ways, and selecting styles that complemented their personalities.”</p>
<p>As an adult, Angela has taken these skills and honed them, developing several staff members from entry-level positions to middle-management department heads. “I am really passionate about making a sustainable difference in people’s lives in a creative way to reflect their inner beauty and bring out their natural gifts and talent,” she adds.</p>
<p>Alongside developing individuals, Angela spends much of her time helping communities – and actively encourages aspiring treasurers to do the same. “If you have very little experience, I would suggest volunteering. I’m part of a non-profit, I was the treasurer for a while, I was the secretary for a while. Whatever skills they needed, I volunteered when I was free, and always free of charge,” she explains.</p>
<p>Up until recently, Angela served on Flying Food Group’s employee relief programme committee. The programme assists employees in need – for example, if someone needs to travel due to family bereavement. “We have this fund that helps them get the transportation, get over there, deal with the expenses. And it’s totally funded by the employees and the company.” She adds that she only stepped down from the committee due to time constraints.</p>
<p>Those time constraints haven’t stopped her ambition, though. Angela has two next major objectives – both focused on helping those in need. For one, she wants to start her own credit union. “I would like to educate women and other businesses in managing money and understanding how money really works,” she explains.</p>
<p>Secondly, Angela and her team are working towards a company goal to provide fully funded medical coverage to all employees (coverage is currently partially funded). “I think my credit union will probably come sooner, but I hope not. I hope the medical coverage comes first,” she says.</p>
<h4 id="education-is-imperative">Education is imperative</h4>
<p>Key to Angela’s initiatives has been her ability to grow with her company. “I started with Flying Food Group when the company was a start-up, and I feel like because I did, I had so many unique experiences. If you’re focusing on trying to get in a big organisation that’s well-established, a lot of times those processes and procedures are also already established,” she explains. However, she notes that to go down the start-up path, having a mentor is a necessity. “Some things you are just not going to know, and that mentor will help you get those skills and those abilities.”</p>
<p>Mentors can be key to a treasurer’s education, and with three bachelor’s degrees and one master’s degree, education is certainly important to Angela. This includes any and all types of learning, from professional qualifications – Angela is a certified treasury professional (CTP) – to personal lessons, such as how to keep a good work-life balance.</p>
<p>A mentor can help with this, too. “Your mentor doesn’t necessarily have to be in treasury,” she explains. “But they do need those skills to be able to lead. You want to make sure that your leader has developed you to be a leader and you want to pass that on to others to become leaders too.” Passing on that skill isn’t just a good thing to do, it also helps improve the individual’s people skills.</p>
<p>With people skills comes the ability to accept people for who they are, focus on their strengths and realise that not everyone thinks the same way as yourself. “That’s one of the things I do when I meet individuals. I try to find that strength that they have, and focus on and develop that,” she notes.</p>
<p>To find a mentor, Angela recommends joining networks of like-minded professionals. For example, she is a member of the Association of Financial Professionals (AFP) and attends the Women of Power Summit. “Once you’re surrounded by like-minded people, the collaboration will expand,” she says.</p>
<p>For women, this collaboration is imperative. Angela has found the main challenge is not only getting a seat at the table, but staying at the table and having a compelling voice. “You definitely need patience,” she says. Not all work environments work in such a way that you can simply say ‘I’m trying to better women’, and so she notes that it sometimes requires a significant amount of strategy to ensure that any policy reaches the company’s goal, as well as the goal to better women.</p></div>

<p>Among these was a panel discussion, Driving Value Through Diversity: Women in Treasury, which was moderated by Sophie Jackson, Publisher and Head of Strategic Content at the Treasury Today Group. Sophie opened the discussion with an overview of Treasury Today Group’s Women in Treasury programme. “Over the course of the last eight years, we’ve spoken with many women across the world,” she said. “But today we’re opening this up to everybody – all genders have a role to play in this conversation.”</p>
<p>As Sophie noted, there is a strong business case for diversity and inclusion in the world today. Recent research illustrates that diverse companies perform the best: a 2018 report by McKinsey &amp; Company showed that companies in the top quartile for gender diversity at board level are 21% more likely to report above average profitability.</p>
<h4 id="being-proactive">Being proactive</h4>
<img alt="Kyriba live panel" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/roundtables-2020/2020-03-05-tt-00-wit__kyriba__cpp_1243__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=21B0E021D989F50351E9EFF3F228F143" style="float:right;margin:0.5em 0 2em 2em;" width="200"/>
<p>It’s clear that businesses have much to gain by furthering diversity and inclusion within the workforce – and the panellists discussed what that means in practice. Yang Xu, VP &amp; Global Treasurer at Kraft Heinz, said she has aimed to build a diverse team over the course of her career. “Some of my team are strategic thinkers; some are very detail-oriented; some are inclined to socialising and interacting with people, and some are very system and process oriented,” she said. “I think together we are a winning team.”</p>
<p>Amy Cochran, CFO &amp; Enterprise Value at Accenture, said that in her role she actively works with talent and HR to make sure that women are being recruited and promoted within the workplace. “Diversity matters, and you have to be vocal about it,” she said. “How do you get your performance to improve? Do you need mentoring? There’s a lot that can happen.”</p>
<p>Focusing on the steps that individuals can take to further their own careers, Maritza Gerde, Assistant Treasurer at Genesys, advised that women should ask themselves how they want their careers to develop and how they can achieve that – “Don’t wait for somebody to come and give that to you.” Noting that some people are less vocal than others about their interests, she also encouraged people to go back to their teams and have conversations with people – both men and women – about what they want to achieve.</p>
<img alt="Kyriba live panel" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/roundtables-2020/2020-03-05-tt-00-wit__kyriba__cpp_1263__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=2602E30E4B6AD071726CCC7A75CE1711" style="float:left;margin:1em 2em 2em 0;" width="200"/>
<h4 id="leveraging-global-talent">Leveraging global talent</h4>
<p>The panel also spoke about the importance of cultural diversity. Maritza said treasury is a unique opportunity to touch almost every aspect of finance, as well as some other areas of the business. She said she enjoys the international element of her career, noting that diversity and inclusion isn’t only about gender – “it’s also in different cultures that you look at.” She added, “There’s different talent out there – there are different people that have different ways of viewing things that could really help your team.”</p>
<p>Christian Kochan, Vice President, Assistant Treasurer at PVH Corporation, said that working overseas had opened his eyes to what other people can bring to the table. “As leaders in some of these groups, we don’t have to be the smartest people in the room,” he said. “We’re only strengthened by the folks that we have around us.”</p>
<h4 id="getting-involved">Getting involved</h4>
<p>Amy also spoke about the role that employee resource groups can play in furthering inclusion and diversity, emphasising the importance of having leadership support and a strategic plan. She explained that the company has subcommittees across areas such as LGBTQ, the generation gap, disability and gender. “We asked them to do charters, commit to a plan, tell us what they needed to be successful,” she said. “Is it working better than it was a couple of years ago? Absolutely – but it takes a voice; it takes leadership; it takes action.”</p>
<img alt="Kyriba live panel" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/roundtables-2020/2020-03-05-tt-00-wit__kyriba__cpp_1260__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=D24DBE71534DAC5AB22A16234C682D17" style="float:right;margin:0.5em 0 2em 2em;" width="200"/>
<p>Maritza added that a workplace may be diverse on paper – but without a plan for supporting diversity and inclusion, it can feel less diverse than it really is. “I fully agree with leadership needing to have a plan and putting together a task force or group of people to have that plan actually push down through the company,” she said.</p>
<h4 id="words-of-wisdom">Words of wisdom</h4>
<p>Finally, Sophie asked the panellists what advice they would give the audience in terms of getting involved in inclusion and diversity. The panel offered a wealth of suggestions, from seeking resources from HR to including the team in decision making. Noting the challenges brought by family commitments, they also emphasised the importance of offering flexible working arrangements, as well as encouraging male colleagues to take paternity leave and normalising flexible working.</p>
<p>In closing, Sophie noted the role that language can play in furthering diversity. “It’s interesting to me how often language presumes that somebody in a senior role is male,” she said. “We need to start speaking about these roles in a different way, so that other people can imagine themselves in them.”</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><h4>Tell us about your career path. Why treasury?</h4>
<p>My choice of the finance field was determined by DNA: my aunts and grandfather held accounting and financial roles. In addition, I have a strong background in mathematics which helped determined my choice.</p>
<p>I got my Bachelor’s degree with honours in Business Administration and Accounting in Kazakhstan, at an international university which was established when the country gained independence. I had a great opportunity to be educated to an internationally recognised level and to work with some of the best professors from around the globe. I managed to graduate earlier than the normal curriculum and was eager to apply what I had learnt in practice.</p>
<p>After careful consideration of the big four auditing firms, I chose to start work at Ernst &amp; Young, whose clientele covered the majority of major oil and gas firms in the country. I was involved in complex auditing and IPO projects. Those two years at Ernst &amp; Young set an important foundation for my professional and personal development.</p>
<p>During my third year there, I took academic leave to pursue my Master’s degree in Accounting and Finance at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. Upon my return, I made a conscious choice to move from auditing to corporate finance in the oil and gas industry.</p>
<p>Having held different roles in project finance and management in the oil and gas industry in Kazakhstan, I decided to take the next step – a change of industry and country. I moved from Kazakhstan to the Netherlands and after a year and a half I was transferred to the Singapore office, where I’m currently covering the Southeast Asia controlling.</p>

<p>My objective is to further expand my duties regionally. I believe it will boost my professional and personal development further.</p>
<h4>What’s the best piece of advice you have been given in your career so far?</h4>
<p>When I was in audit, we had a golden rule – the 15-minute rule. When you face a challenge, think about it for 15 minutes. If you don’t find a solution within 15 minutes by yourself, then seek help. I apply that rule to my whole life now.</p>
<h4>If there is one thing you could have done differently in your career path, what would that be?</h4>
<p>I strongly believe that whatever happens in life is for the best. All the conscious choices we make will give us the necessary experience and develop particular skills that we might need at some point later in time. I once took on a role of project manager in an industrial automation project, which was quite a shift from my financial background, but developed vital skills that I am still utilising now. All the roles I’ve taken have helped develop me into a better business partner.</p>
<h4>What is your motto in life?</h4>
<p>If I can dream it, I can do it.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><h4 id="overcoming-challenges">Overcoming challenges</h4>
<p>The biggest challenges facing corporate treasurers, in Aigerim’s opinion, come from the localisation of global businesses, and the automation of processes. In the age of artificial intelligence, it is important to plan the human and artificial interface thoroughly in order to create the required efficiency. Additionally, Aigerim says that expanding businesses across the globe brings new challenges: “Cultural and political aspects can be game changers.”</p>
<p>However, moving around the world has also given Aigerim the opportunity to learn about other cultures’ ways of working – and for her, this has provided one of the biggest learning curves. She explains that moving to the Netherlands meant she had to adjust from Kazakhstan’s fairly hierarchical environment to the Dutch trust-based system, before adjusting back to a more hierarchical system when she moved to Singapore.</p>
<p>The key to successfully managing this, she says, lies with a piece of advice given to her from a manager in the Netherlands – “don’t be afraid to be vulnerable”. She argues that entering into an unfamiliar situation and being open about any hesitancies allows colleagues to support you. “When you’re in this transition and trying to grow, you have the opportunity to be a bit more vulnerable in the beginning, so that people can see where best they can support you,” says Aigerim.</p>
<p>In terms of how treasurers can make their voices heard within their organisations, Aigerim recommends identifying key decision makers and having good relationships at the right levels. “You need to help decision makers by providing valuable insights, but you also need to get insights from others. It’s a two-way thing,” she says. “Sometimes you can have amazing ideas, but not the ability to raise them properly – so it’s about making sure you have the right communication techniques and adjusting them accordingly.”</p>
<p>That said, Aigerim notes that one of the biggest challenges for women in the workplace is around achieving a work-life balance. “Make sure you have the right balance so you can enjoy your work and also your personal life, and live up to values and priorities by developing your own vision and enhancing it,” she advises. “Especially in a professional environment, I try not to differentiate by gender. There are common success factors for both genders, but my advice, especially for women, would be to be true to themselves and build the right platform for being heard.”</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><h4 id="developing-yourself">Developing yourself</h4>
<p>Looking back at her career, Aigerim believes education is important, and she encourages junior treasury professionals to learn as much as they can via different means: on the job, self-learning, and certifications and qualifications, for example. “Learn on the go and take offered opportunities to develop your unique and authentic approach to handling things,” she says. Additionally, she believes that the beginning of a career is important when it comes to setting good habits. “Building up your relationships, handling your resource management or time management,” she adds.</p>
<p>In order to move forward though, Aigerim notes that experience is a necessity – both having it, and actively seeking it out. “Take as many opportunities as you can, but sustainably – so you don’t burn out.”</p>
<p>Additionally, Aigerim notes that confidence is important. “Just know that you’re good enough to take any opportunities that are offered. I believe that it only lands on your desk once you are ready to handle it.” For women especially, she encourages individuals to ask for the challenges they think they’re ready to take. “Take your development into your own hands,” she concludes.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>We asked India Gary Martin of Leadership for Executives for her guidance on ‘How to build your personal brand’.</p>
<p>Personal brand is about more than what you project to the outside world. It is about being your authentic self and then layering what you want to be known for.</p>
<p>Authenticity does not mean that you have to show your whole self to the world, it means that what you do show is a true representation of who you are.</p>
<p>Personal brand is intentional work.</p>
<p>Your brand will certainly emerge as a result of the work that you do. Managing perception and being intentional about your personal messaging is the ultimate determinant of your brand aroma. That is the emotional scent that you bring and take when you enter or leave a room.</p>
<p>Although it is a necessary component of profile, personal brand is often confused with marketing though, it is sometimes used as such.</p>
<p>Personal appearance is certainly a part of your brand but in a professional capacity having a personal brand is like a marker of sorts. It helps people to frame what they are going to get in their interactions with you.</p>
<p>Personal brand is about consistency of message. People who are consistent tend to be easier to work with and inevitably easier to trust, even when you don’t agree.</p>
<p>Managing one’s brand is an essential part of any leadership toolkit.</p>
<p>Understanding the impact that you have on others, both positive and challenging, is one of the keys to successfully leading teams, supporting clients and building relationships.</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p>On 10<sup>th</sup> October, Treasury Today went to The Roosevelt Hotel in New York for our fourth annual Women in Treasury (WiT) New York Forum. Over 150 guests attended the event, with women and men from a multitude of sectors joined by their banking and technology partners from across the US.</p>
<p>This year’s panel, moderated by Sophie Jackson, Publisher &amp; Head of Strategic Content, Treasury Today Group, consisted of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Lynda Johnson</strong> – Assistant Treasurer, Harley-Davidson</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>India Gary-Martin</strong> – Executive Coach, Leadership Expert &amp; Advisor, Leadership for Executives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Catherine Portman</strong> – Head of Global Treasury, Uber</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Laurette DelGuercio</strong> – Director, Global Liquidity and Cash Management, Employee Client Engagement, HSBC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Kate Sandman McKinley</strong> – Senior Vice President and General Counsel, State Street Global Advisors</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Key themes discussed during the forum included diversity and inclusion, intersectionality, overcoming challenges, mentoring and ally-ship – all of which are also examined in the 2019 Women in Treasury Global Study, sponsored by State Street Global Advisors.</p>
<h4 id="career-paths">Career paths</h4>
<img alt="Women in Treasury New York Forum 2019" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/new-york-2019/2020-01-02-tt-03-wit__2019-wit-nyk-469__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=AE65A48949C58CA64BB430AAEC0D5797" style="float:left;margin:0.5em 2em 2em 0;" width="200"/>
<p>Lynda Johnson described her path into treasury as “anything but linear and straight”, before revealing that her undergraduate degree is in Chemistry and English. After realising that “finance organisations ruled the world,” Lynda earned her MBA and worked for various technology-orientated companies, before moving to Harley-Davidson for a role that offered “stability, but also fun”. She moved to treasury eight years ago after working in various other roles in a number of different locations – including one international assignment.</p>
<p>India Gary-Martin, in contrast, worked in investment banking for 25 years before starting in executive transformation. She described her role as “helping leaders to be better leaders,” and she credited her previous position as Managing Director &amp; Global COO for Investment Banking Technology and Operations at J.P. Morgan as preparing her for being able to help others with self-improvement.</p>
<p>Kate Sandman McKinley told the room of her journey through the legal and financial services sectors, and how as a junior associate she would often be mistaken for the partner’s secretary in meetings. She noted that just 15 years ago, incidents like that would simply be laughed off: “wait until they get the bill, then they’ll realise you aren’t the secretary!”, and she often wouldn’t even notice that she was the only female in the room. “The difference is that people talk about it now,” she stated. But, she added, we need to do more than just be aware; we also need to hold people accountable.</p></div>

<p>For Catherine Portman, spending 18 years working for one company, Juniper, gave her an “amazing journey” whilst building and leading the treasury organisation. Although she felt fully supported by CFOs, she also felt that she needed to be re-energised. Catherine described how she took on the challenge of joining Uber just five days before the company went public and overcame several personal and professional challenges in doing so. Her achievements were so great that she was awarded Overall Winner in the Woman of the Year category for Treasury Today’s 2019 Adam Smith Awards.</p>
<p>Laurette DelGuercio began by explaining that she had been in banking since graduating. It was early in her career that she realised she “wanted to go where there are new things,” and has since always looked for positions that enable her to build new businesses products and distribution channels. She described how after working for Citibank, she began consulting and became heavily involved in the start-up ecosystem that then-mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, was working on after the financial crisis. Eighteen months ago, Laurette was involved in the formation of a new group in HSBC’s Global Liquidity and Cash Management (GLCM) business, the Employee and Client Engagement Team. She noted that by joining on the employee engagement side, her goal is to help all colleagues in GLCM attain their career goals and aspirations on a global scale.</p>
<h4 id="a-passion-for-inclusion">A passion for inclusion</h4>
<img alt="Women in Treasury New York Forum 2019" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/new-york-2019/2020-01-02-tt-03-wit__2019-wit-nyk-021__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=C1821ACF527504A0CA44F28908ED8534" style="float:left;margin:0.5em 2em 2em 0;" width="200"/>
<p>Laurette stated that her passion for inclusive environments began early and throughout high school and college her involvement in championing inclusivity was established, and continues today. When working in New York after the 2008 financial crisis, she quickly realised that there were few women in the start-up ecosystem. In response, she partnered with large corporations and start-up ecosystem leaders – chairmen/women, CEOs, CFOs – and created Women Entrepreneurs and Investors. Her “passion work”, she said, is the time she spends supporting women’s programmes and coaching female entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>For India, former President of City Women’s Network, diversity and inclusion come down to the notions of intersectionality and equity. She noted that firms often begin the diversity discussion, but then only really focus on gender. “I’m not only a woman,” said India, “I’m a black woman.” She then wondered what the limited scope of the discussion meant for the other large part of her identity. Although diversity and inclusion are hugely important, she feels that equity cannot be ignored, especially not for women with various intersectional points. “Keep an equal focus on the diversity pillars, not just the easy ones,” she stated. “Easy doesn’t mean right.”</p>
<h4 id="stepping-out-of-the-comfort-zone">Stepping out of the comfort zone</h4>
<p>When Lynda joined the treasury department just eight years ago, she started by turning her attention to developing her leadership skills. “I had a great team that knew what they were doing, so I let them focus on that whilst I focussed on being a good leader,” she said. With her constant drive for improvement and enthusiasm for a challenge, she implemented SAP treasury workstation globally, and also led her team to becoming Overall Winner in the Best Card Solution category in Treasury Today’s 2019 Adam Smith Awards. “I’m always looking for continuous improvement opportunities, and I seek to find a path to yes as the answer,” she said.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Much like Lynda, Kate had to step out of her comfort zone to become the COO of State Street Global Advisors’ Americas Institutional Client Group a few years ago, after being the Deputy General Counsel for the company. One key fear, she said, came from realising that her predecessor had a vastly different background to her own. “I learned a lot,” she said, “I had to learn to manage and lead large teams of people that were subject experts in areas where I had less experience.” After moving back to the legal department as General Counsel in January 2019, she said that being in a role on the other side of the table has given her a new perspective that she feels can benefit the legal department as a whole.</p>
<h4 id="reverse-mentoring">Reverse mentoring</h4>
<p>Laurette gave an outline of the concept of reverse mentoring – the process of getting younger employees to be mentors to senior leaders. “The millennial generation can teach senior leaders how to use tech,” she gave as an example, noting that this understanding can put leaders in a better position to lead the business in an increasingly digital world. And the same principles can be applied beyond technology. The concept is still relatively new, so there isn’t yet the data to demonstrate whether it’s making a change, explained Laurette. But as she said, “Exposure is the first step, and I would like to think senior leaders are listening, and that this can help to eliminate unconscious bias.”</p>
<h4 id="being-overlooked">Being overlooked</h4>
<img alt="Women in Treasury New York Forum 2019" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/new-york-2019/2020-01-02-tt-03-wit__2019-wit-nyk-181__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=59EC0406803937A1359F8381426085AD" style="float:right;margin:0.5em 0 2em 2em;" width="200">
<p>Catherine gave a personal example from a long time ago, where she was overlooked for a promotion for a year because the promoting manager knew that she would react to the rejection better than her male counterpart. In her experience, “it comes down to having either an official or unofficial mentor or advocate.” She recommends building trust across certain teams of leaders who understand your strengths.</p>
<p>Laurette, meanwhile, encourages women to “open the dialogue” about their achievements. “When it’s clear what you’ve achieved and what you’ve delivered, and you know what it is that you want, you need to speak up for it and let people know what that is,” she said. Laurette spoke of an idea publicised by HSBC’s Global Head of GLCM, Diane S Reyes, that every woman should have an ‘elevator pitch’ ready. The idea is that an individual should be able to say exactly what they want in the time it takes for an elevator journey, should they bump into a senior executive. She also seconded Catherine’s advice and recommended that women get themselves a sponsor.</p>
<p>Lynda said she talks not only about things she has done in her company, but also about the sponsoring she does and the boards she’s on. “I share that I’m a broad thinker and contributor,” she added. With regards to an elevator pitch, she noted that the best thing to do is “know your pitch and keep it succinct”, and recommended thinking of it as a performance assessment.</p>
<p>India remarked on how “women second guess themselves about being ready,” whereas male peers tend to approach new opportunities whenever they can. “If there’s a job that you want and you know you pretty much tick most of the boxes, then go for it. What do you have to lose?” she asked. India also commented on the difference between core skills and behaviours, and how women shouldn’t be put off by these requirements for jobs. “You can learn skills and change behaviours,” she said.</p>
<h4 id="ally-ship">Ally-ship</h4>
<p>For Laurette, “Ally-ship is about supporting people who are marginalised,” and requires a large focus on relationships. The purpose, she thinks “is to give them a hand up, or even just help.” As she said, “I’d rather teach someone to fish than serve them a fish dinner.”</p>
<p>India expanded on this, stating “I believe in teaching people to fish, as long as the pole is the same length.” For her, it’s a “humanity issue”, and about “basic human behaviour”. She has found that “there is absolute value in supporting people, and it takes brave voices for people to stand up and support marginalised people.” She also said a key question people should be asking is: “do I need allies or do I need people to behave like humans and do the right thing?”</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury New York Forum 2019" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/new-york-2019/2020-01-02-tt-03-wit__2019-wit-nyk-185__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=1A19724B3CB9182173CA6C65827B979A" style="float:left;margin:0.5em 2em 2em 0;" width="200">
<p>“Ally-ship is interesting as a concept, but the reality is that it’s about shifting your behaviour, looking at how people are impacted in your organisation, what you want your business to look like, what you want your life to be like and how to get the best out of people. The demographic of the population is changing and we have to ensure there are equal levels of representation across all sectors of business, government and education,” India said.</p>
<p>As Lynda stated, “we are the current and future leaders of our organisations.” By opening up the dialogue around all intersectional points at events like the WiT forums and roundtables, and by utilising concepts like reverse mentoring, “we can take this cause even further along in elevating women to the next levels in the organisation,” she added.</p>
<h4 id="flexible-working">Flexible working</h4>
<p>With the steady increase in the number of companies offering flexible working, Kate explained that “this is an area in which we’ve seen very strong improvement over the past ten years.” She described it as an “invaluable tool” for both managers and employees, drawing on her personal experience as a parent. When she worked from home for one day a week after the birth of her first child, she said, she worked harder and longer on those days because she was so grateful for the opportunity. She credited technology for enabling the ease of a flexible working arrangement and removing some of the challenges and stigma that used to exist around it.</p>
<p>For Laurette, flexible working is a necessity at HSBC. Working in a global role, they meet with colleagues all hours to accommodate varying time zones, she stated that in these instances “the only way for staff to fully do their job is to work from home.” She added that “the lack of stigma is making all the difference in the world, for men and women.”</p>
<p>Like Kate, India found that when she began working from home, she worked a lot longer and harder, “largely because I wanted people to know I was still working hard.” However, she stated, this isn’t necessarily a good thing – and corporate culture needs to shift so that employees don’t feel that need to prove their dedication.</p>
<h4 id="words-of-wisdom">Words of wisdom</h4>
<p>When asked what they’ve learnt along their journeys, and what they can do in positions of leadership to open access and encourage inclusivity, the speakers had plenty of insights to share. Kate noted the importance of small gestures, like “scheduling meetings for times that work for families, people with religious obligations, people in different time zones,” as well as undertaking things like unconscious bias training.</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury New York Forum 2019" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/new-york-2019/2020-01-02-tt-03-wit__2019-wit-nyk-254__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=6C7D4F0F2EAB29CF8705722B4A200C56" style="float:right;margin:0.5em 0 2em 2em;" width="200">
<p>Lynda stated that she found the most important thing to be achieving a good work-life balance. “I felt I couldn’t do anything but work, and I realised I didn’t have a life,” she said. After finding things to do outside of work, she realised she actually felt more productive when she had a fuller life, which in turn led to her giving more back into work.</p>
<p>“Don’t sweat the small stuff,” is what Catherine had to offer. “You have to move on from small things that you can’t change and focus on the positives in your career.” She also recommended finding a network and “someone that you connect with and can talk about challenges with,” highlighting the importance of these actions from a career perspective.</p>
<p>For India, authenticity is the most important thing when building the groundwork for progressing in a career. “Be who you are,” she said. “It’s clichéd but true.” She adds that while it may be easy to adopt other characteristics to try and succeed – “like those of the people above you” – being “authentic and comfortable in your own skin” is one of the most important things an individual can do.</p>
<p>Echoing India’s thoughts on authenticity, Laurette has found that “you don’t have to bring your whole self to work, but you do have to bring your authentic self.” From the increase in flexible working and awareness of unconscious bias, she said it is clear that “the call to action is here and organisations are answering.”</p>
<h4 id="getting-involved">Getting involved</h4>
<p>We’d like to offer our thanks to all who took part in, attended, and supported our Women in Treasury New York Forum, and encourage anyone who is interested to get involved.</p>

<p><em>This year Marie-Astrid Dubois stepped down from a long-standing and impressive career at Honeywell as Assistant Treasurer for EMEA and Asia. Her influence on the global treasury community cannot be underestimated and she has supported Treasury Today Group’s Women in Treasury initiative from the very beginning, acting as a panellist at the very first forum in London seven years ago. We approached her for advice as part of our ‘Ask an expert’ feature, and she shared some hot tips for all those in the treasury profession.</em></p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4>How did you start out in treasury?</h4>
<p>I was in the management development programme of the Dexter Corp oration in the US. The CFO asked me to move to Belgium and help the Assistant Treasurer open a Belgian Coordination Centre with a Treasury Centre to take care of the international side of treasury. I did not know what treasury was, but was happy to be back in Europe. It was exciting times, starting with a blank sheet of paper, we developed a fully-fledged international treasury centre.</p>
<h4>What do you think has been a defining factor in your long standing and accomplished career?</h4>
<p>That first experience was just incredible. For the first few months I was on my own in Brussels, and I had to understand what international treasury was, meet with our peers and bankers, understand what our businesses needed, and make a plan. It was an intense discovery phase – where I was trusted, I had to use my smarts, make proposals and just go for it. The trust in my thinking and doing abilities allowed me to blossom.</p>
<h4>How can professionals wanting to advance up the career ladder stand out and get ahead?</h4>
<p>Be curious, be current, meet other treasury professionals, go to treasury conferences and understand the latest developments. Take up all the learning possibilities you have and think outside the box, challenge the status quo – in other words, don’t sit still and wait, create your own opportunities! Trust yourself and earn the trust of others both internally and externally. You earn it by delivering, sticking to your promises, supporting the business and by being a collaborative partner.</p>
<h4>What advice would you offer other women looking to succeed in this field?</h4>
<p>Find a company with a culture that works for you, which uses your skills and allows you to develop. For my part, I always worked for American companies because I knew it fitted my personality better, that being a woman was typically not a limiting factor. I also chose to remain in Europe because I felt it was here I could have the most impact while having enough room for manoeuvre to do my thinking-outside-the-box. In other words, know what is important for you so you can better choose a company that will allow you to deploy your capabilities.</p>
<h4>What’s the biggest lesson you learnt over the course of your career?</h4>
<p>The importance of being trusted and empowered and its corollary, empower and trust your team and make them accountable.</p></div>

<p>On 12<sup>th</sup> November, the Women in Treasury initiative came to Singapore’s stylish Fullerton Bay Hotel for an afternoon of shared insights and lively discussion around the topic of diversity and inclusion.</p>
<p>The event began with a welcome from David Fletcher, Head of APAC Cash Sales, Global Cash Business at State Street Global Advisors. David explained that Treasury Today’s Women in Treasury initiative is “closely aligned with what we do at State Street Global Advisors, and what we believe in terms of pushing the agenda for inclusion and diversity in the workplace.”</p>
<p>Next up was Sophie Jackson, Joint Publisher &amp; Head of Strategic Content at the Treasury Today Group, with an explanation of the Women in Treasury initiative and the forums and discussions this has included over the last seven years. “The longer I spend studying the statistics that we’re seeing, the more I realise it’s individual stories that shape the conversation,” Sophie commented.</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury Singapore Roundtable 2019" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/roundtables-2019/2019-11-20-tt-00-wit__singapore__2019-rtb-sng-066__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=BD3679A9A8EB7A5F4837F8C92EFF55E8" style="float:right;margin:0.5em 0 2em 2em;"/>
<p>Introductions were followed by an intimate discussion with two inspirational speakers: Sarika Joshi, Director of Corporate Finance at ZALORA Group and Latifah Mohamed Yusof, Group Treasurer at Astro Malaysia Holdings Berhad.</p>
<p>Noting that “change has been the constant” during her career, Sarika described the different roles she has held and the experiences she has gained at companies including Nokia and Dell, before moving into her current role at ZALORA last year. Latifah spoke powerfully about her experiences of being considered a minority in both Singapore and Malaysia, adding that with Astro currently working to promote inclusion within the organisation, she consciously aims for diversity when hiring new staff.</p>
<p>The experts turned to the issue of ‘burnout’ and how to know when it’s time to take a step back. Sarika spoke about her experience of taking time out from her career to focus on some of the other things she wanted to achieve. After spending time travelling and developing her interests in filmmaking and photography, she realised that she missed her working life – and she has subsequently been able to integrate her other interests alongside her working life. Latifah, meanwhile, described her experience of working around the clock in a fast-paced environment, adding “I wished I could take a break, but I never did.”</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury Singapore Roundtable 2019" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/roundtables-2019/2019-11-20-tt-00-wit__singapore__2019-rtb-sng-056__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=3C1F582C7BEE073EA6D39FAC970937F4" style="float:left;margin:0.5em 2em 2em 0;"/>
<p>The discussion also focused on the future of the workplace and the role that technology can play in addressing pain points, now and in the future. Sarika commented that treasury “used to be very siloed, but is now really part of the business.” She added that consumer-facing companies are focusing closely on how to harness big data in order to come up with better solutions.</p>
<p>After a coffee break, Sophie presented the findings of the newly published Treasury Today Women in Treasury Study 2019 – the seventh so far. She invited attendees to share their thoughts on some of the topics discussed in the study, from the importance of diversity and inclusion to the controversial topic of board quotas.</p>
<p>One female treasurer spoke positively about the diversity of the workplace in Singapore and the support that working mothers typically receive from employers. “There’s never been a better time than now to be a woman in the workforce,” she commented.</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury Singapore Roundtable 2019" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/roundtables-2019/2019-11-20-tt-00-wit__singapore__2019-rtb-sng-024__1920x1080.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=0DA6F6E7C5367B379B75FB296F9B7734" style="float:right;margin:0.5em 0 2em 2em;"/>
<p>Another area of focus was the importance of mentoring for female treasury professionals. Earlier in the discussion Latifah, who was Highly Commended Woman of the Year at this year’s Adam Smith Awards Asia, dedicated this success to her mentors. “Without them, I don’t think I would be where I am today,” she said.</p>
<p>Noting that 70% of respondents to the 2019 study felt that mentoring, sponsorship or coaching was important for a successful career, Sophie invited participants to share their experiences of mentoring in the workplace. This sparked some interesting discussions around the pros and cons of formal and informal arrangements, as well as attendees’ experiences of reverse mentoring, whereby leaders are mentored by junior colleagues. Attendees also shared their thoughts on topics such as flexible working, parental leave and the importance of diversity within multinational organisations that connect to customers around the world.</p>
<p>Closing the event, David thanked attendees for participating, noting how valuable it had been to hear about individuals’ experiences and thoughts on the topic of diversity and inclusion within an informal setting.</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Results from the 2019 Women in Treasury Annual Global Study, in association with State Street Global Advisors, were shared for the first time and the key themes explored throughout the day included diversity and inclusion, discrimination, overcoming challenges and making male allies. The panel of senior treasury professionals were eager to share their experiences in these areas, and offer their advice to others in the Q&amp;A session afterwards.</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury London Forum 2019" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/london-2019/2019-11-12-tt-03-wit__083__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=35405769DE0971B87EAD210E4F22BBF1" style="float:left;margin:0.5em 2em 2em 0;">
<p>The event also heralded the arrival of the new dedicated Women in Treasury (WiT) community platform, Within. This gives our readership a bi-monthly newsletter, with resources including ‘How To’ videos and ‘Ask an Expert’ features. The platform has been designed to equip women with essential tools and guidance for combatting the challenges many face in their professional lives. Within will roll out into a full-scale online hub for the global community in 2020.</p>
<p>As the latest step in our WiT initiative, Within aims to continue the discussion on diversity, inclusion and representation in corporate treasury, the past seven years of WiT having demonstrated a real shift in how important these discussions are. The powerful social movements promoting women’s rights have brought the challenges faced by women in the workplace into the spotlight, and this is unlikely to change anytime soon.</p>
<h4 id="diversity-and-inclusion">Diversity and inclusion</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, the WiT initiative is broadening its focus beyond gender diversity to include issues such as ethnic diversity and the availability of flexible working and parental leave for men. These topics have now become part of a broader conversation around corporate social responsibility (CSR) and environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. Many companies across the globe are now striving for a more caring and responsible relationship with employees and the communities in which they operate.</p>
<p>The initiative is also drawing attention to the significant difference between the concepts of inclusion and diversity. As one of our panellists, Pia McCusker, Senior Managing Director and Global Head of Cash Management, State Street Global Advisors, put it, “To me, diversity means having different perspectives, different outlooks and different ideas. Inclusion is having a safe environment to allow for those different outlooks.”</p>
<h4 id="key-findings">Key findings</h4>
<img alt="Women in Treasury London Forum 2019" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/london-2019/2019-11-12-tt-03-wit__096__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=56CAA4DF9AB880482DC4740DF218F15E" style="float:right;margin:0.5em 0 2em 2em;"/>
<p>Some of the key highlights from the 2019 study were shared with the attendees at this year’s Women in Treasury London Forum, and this was the first time the results had been publicly discussed.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The majority of the 335 respondents were aged between 35 and 54 and over half had been in a treasury role for over ten years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>53% have dependent children and 17% have other dependents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over 80% of companies now offer employees flexible working arrangements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>47% said they feel that they earn less than their male counterparts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only 7% said there had been recent changes in pay parity within their organisation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>36% have felt overlooked and ignored in the workplace because of their gender.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>75% have felt overlooked and ignored in the workplace because of their age.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>46% of respondents are in favour of quotas for female representation on boards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>34% of respondents are in favour of quotas for ethnic diversity on boards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>8% have female CEOs, compared to 5% last year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>80% do not have a diverse board leading the company.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The ensuing discussion aimed to unpick some of these findings. This year’s panel, moderated by Sophie Jackson, Joint Publisher &amp; Head of Strategic Content at Treasury Today Group, consisted of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Hailey Laverty</strong> – Group Treasurer, InterContinental Hotels Group plc (IHG).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Joseph Peka</strong> – Deputy Treasury, URENCO.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Joanne Bates</strong> – International Treasurer, Worldpay, Inc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nadya Hijazi</strong> – Managing Director &amp; Global Head of Global Liquidity and Cash Management Digital, HSBC.</p>
</li>

<h2 class="h3 copy__heading">What do the terms ‘diversity’ and ‘inclusion’ mean to you? Answers from our Women in Treasury Global Study 2019</h2>
<div class="copy__body"><p>“Diversity is when groups reflect a range of backgrounds. Inclusion is when everyone has an invitation to participate.”</p>
<p>“Diversity means that your company represents the globe, not just one demographic. Inclusion means that you feel as if you are treated as a work colleague, not as the box you tick on a survey.”</p>
<p>“When you have different groups, you have diversity. When you integrate these different groups, you have inclusion.”</p>
<p>“It means that not only do you have a seat at the table but a voice. It’s more than race, religion and ethnicity. Diversity of thought, which is a by-product of all of those things, is what brings value to an organisation.”</p></div>

<p>“I love my job and I love treasury, and I’m so glad I stumbled across it when I did.” Like many, Joanne Bates never set out with the intention of working in treasury. Her journey began when she was studying to become an accountant and her second placement was in treasury. Fast forward a few years and, aged just 26, she became Deputy Treasurer at a subsidiary, later joining Worldpay where she was promoted to the role of Treasurer three years ago.</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury London Forum 2019" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/london-2019/2019-11-12-tt-03-wit__040__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=E3E91DF3F090AAD7A17F60491109ECA7" style="float:left;margin:0.5em 2em 2em 0;"/>
<p>Like Joanne, Hailey Laverty also came from an accountancy background. She joined Deloitte as part of the auditing team before moving to Rolls-Royce in accounting, and then transferring to the treasury team. Three years ago she moved to IHG where she became Group Treasurer. She likes the fact that with treasury she has been able to gain more of an appreciation for what’s going on in the wider markets and that the role has an economic focus.</p>
<p>The journey for Pia McCusker began with her mother setting her on her path by moving to the US. “Her inspiration and her independent streak is something that I love,” says Pia. She later worked at a summer internship at a bank where she cites the support and encouragement of her female senior manager as the reason she began to enjoy being in finance. Eventually Pia worked as an Assistant Budget Director whilst studying at graduate school, before starting at State Street Global Markets as a Structured Product Analyst. She later switched to State Street Global Advisors as a Credit Analyst before working her way up to her current role.</p>
<p>The cultural challenges faced by Nadya Hijazi growing up in UAE meant that despite having studied law in the UK, she struggled to find work as a solicitor in her home country. She was forced to accept a role in a bank that employed just ten women. She overcame considerable hurdles to be taken seriously as a professional working female, eventually moving back to the UK in the early 2000s, realising “there wasn’t just a glass ceiling for me to break through, there was a brick wall.” She encountered even more obstacles from her decision to pursue digital technology as it was thought by everyone in the industry that it wouldn’t ever take off.</p>
<h4 id="challenges">Challenges</h4>
<p>Nadya emphasises the internal challenges of women, noting that “we tend to associate what we’re doing today with what our ability is.” Employers, she argues, often have an inability “to distinguish between potential and performance” where women are concerned.</p>
<p>A question in the later session summarised this: “As a female you have to show that you are capable of your next progressive move before they will put you into these positions, but as a male, typically you will be put into these positions before you’ve actually represented yourself within those roles.”</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury London Forum 2019" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/london-2019/2019-11-12-tt-03-wit__063__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=6EED3CFFE48D0DB5C0EB2DB05D97CF15" style="float:right;margin:0.5em 0 2em 2em;"/>
<p>Nadya also feels that women tend to be very hard on themselves and have a self-limiting belief, refusing to put themselves forward for jobs that they don’t believe they have the entire skillset for. “Women have something in our psychology where we like to be secure and we don’t like to fail,” states Nadya. Her advice? “Volunteer for projects outside of your comfort zone. You learn a new topic, you network and meet new people, and the more you do it, the more confident you get.”</p>
<p>When Hailey left Deloitte – and her largely female team – the culture shock was the biggest challenge. Joining an all-male team at her next company, her first thought was, “It’s a good job I like football.” Early on in her career, she had always thought that every company would have the same attitude as Deloitte: that if you work hard, people will notice and you’ll get promoted. She credits Sheryl Sandberg’s book, Lean In, for teaching her that it is not that simple, and by highlighting the behavioural differences between women and men it has helped her to actively support her teams better.</p>
<p>After being promoted, Pia also noticed a lack of gender and ethnic diversity within her team. Over time, she was able to restructure the team and hire new talent from outside the organisation. She stated that while promoting within an organisation encourages employee loyalty, it can also entrench existing views and attitudes. By introducing new staff, Pia was able to garner fresh insights and ideas which spurred interesting discussions.</p>
<p>Alongside this, Pia makes an active effort to have a “team huddle” on a weekly basis, to ensure that everyone’s opinions are able to be heard. She has found that by doing this it creates a more open, collaborative, and inclusive working environment.</p>
<p>Joanne found a personal challenge for her was constantly being misjudged by others in the industry. “Underestimate me at your peril!” she joked. Whilst it was 20 years ago that she entered a meeting with a CFO and was asked if she took shorthand, it has only been four years since she was Deputy Treasurer and mistaken for a PA. The biggest challenge, in her opinion, is fighting unconscious bias.</p>
<p>Joanne believes that the key to doing this is by making sure that people are aware of their unconscious biases – as well as by encouraging forums like Women in Treasury that raise awareness and support discussion of these issues.</p>
<h4 id="mentoring-and-sponsorship">Mentoring and sponsorship</h4>
<p>When it comes to mentoring and sponsorship, Nadya has found that it can be quite rare to find women who are willing to act as sponsors. Senior female leaders tend to be less open to sponsorship than men, in her experience. “What I would say to people in this room is, ‘Don’t be that woman!’” she encouraged.</p>
<p>Hailey has ensured she is involved with internal networking groups, set up under the ‘Lean In’ framework. “As one of the most senior women in our office, I feel that there is a responsibility to contribute to those networks,” she stated.</p>
<p>Joanne agreed that networking is the best way to find mentors and sponsors, and events like the Women in Treasury Forum are a great place to do this. She recommended that if women come across someone that they have a good rapport with – in their own organisations or elsewhere – then they should work to keep those relationships active.</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury London Forum 2019" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/london-2019/2019-11-12-tt-03-wit__298__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=08DC9433B8DD140CABDFDE0BA4757361" style="float:left;margin:0.5em 2em 2em 0;"/>
<p>She believes that unofficial mentors are just as good as official ones, and that you don’t need to have an official scheme in your workplace to get a mentor or sponsor. “The important thing is to take control of your career,” she said. “Don’t wait until your company has an official programme. Go and find someone that you’re inspired by and ask them to do it, because most people are really interested in helping others.”</p>
<p>Joanne added that it may only be necessary to meet once per quarter in order to make a difference. She also recognised the benefits of having a sponsor as they can create opportunities for you and advocate for you, which is essential for moving up in a company.</p>
<p>Like Hailey, Joanne goes out of her way to encourage staff to ask questions so she can offer advice where she can. She noted that sometimes having a mentor outside of the organisation can be better, as they can offer advice without having to think about what is best for the company.</p>
<p>Nadya noted the importance of selecting the right mentor for a specific problem, and also recommended that women seeking a mentor carry out LinkedIn searches for keywords based on the type of people they want, while focussing on what they are aiming to get out of the relationship in advance.</p>
<h4 id="making-male-allies">Making male allies</h4>
<p>Joe Peka, as a male ally and our male panellist, spoke about recognising the importance of having men involved with movements like WiT. “Being involved in this type of event is about leadership, it’s about demonstrating that you care about high performance, and how high performance has got nothing to do with gender,” he stated.</p>
<p>Sophie Jackson added that “the importance of stepping out of your organisations, being part of a network and sharing your experiences, really can’t be underestimated.” She suggested that in order to get more men on board, the movement needs to become clearer about why men need to be involved, and what they can do.</p>
<h4 id="final-advice">Final advice</h4>
<p>In offering some parting wisdom, Pia said the biggest lesson she had learnt in her career was to “be bold and stand up for what you believe in.” If you know in your gut that you’re making the right decision, you need to fight for it, she added.</p>
<p>On a purely practical level, Nadya recommended paying attention to how many women are scribbling notes during meetings, versus how many men. She noted that by sitting and listening as so many men do, women may be better able to engage in the meeting – whereas studiously writing notes risks missing out on being involved in the discussion. Sophie added to this, “Own your presence. Walk into that meeting and own your space.”</p>
<p>On the topic of facing challenges, Hailey recognised that “at the time it might be really tough, but once you’ve got through it and can look back, you can realise how much you learnt from it.” Joanne recommended that everyone go out and research unconscious bias in order to learn what the traps are and how to avoid them. Finally, on the topic of advice for male allies, Joe’s tip for men wanting to help was that “being visible in that support is better than waiting to develop expertise” in diversity and inclusion.</p>
<h4 id="getting-involved">Getting involved</h4>
<p>We’d like to offer a final thank you to all who took part in, attended, and supported our Women in Treasury London Forum, and encourage anyone who is interested to get involved.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways you can do this, including attending our global forums, taking part in the 2020 Women in Treasury Global Study, joining our dedicated WiT network on LinkedIn, or by nominating yourself or a team member in the Adam Smith Awards Woman of the Year category when submissions open on 31<sup>st</sup> January 2020.</p></div>

<p><em>Thursday March 8<sup>th</sup> 2018 marked not only International Women’s Day, but also the official launch of the partnership between Treasury Today Group and State Street Global Advisors on the Treasury Today Women in Treasury Global Study. One year on, and what has come out of this relationship so far has been another successful annual study, multiple global forums and a series of global roundtables, bringing together women and men from all industries to discuss current issues faced today in corporate treasury.</em></p>
<p><em>2019, the second year of this partnership, was especially productive for expanding and improving the dialogue around these issues, so here’s a look back at the past year and what we have achieved.</em></p>

<h4 id="march-8th-2019-new-york-city">March 8<sup>th</sup> 2019 – New York City</h4>
<p>Following our 2018 activities in New York City, we chose to build on our community’s conversation and revisit New York City with the Women in Treasury initiative. The day was a busy one for all. After welcoming speeches, an insightful discussion and debate took place with State Street Global Advisors’ Pia McCusker, Senior Managing Director and Global Head of Cash Management, and Dominica Ribeiro, Head of Institutional Marketing, North America.</p>
<p>The discussion focussed on corporate culture and why it matters, whilst the debate centred around the challenges that come from trying to instil a company ethos into an already established team, and the importance of having a positive working environment in order to attract and retain top talent.</p>
<p>The afternoon included a workshop, facilitated by Louise Watts, Director of HPC Global and Founder of Transition Hub, focussing on executive presence, followed by a panel discussion with the State Street Global Advisors representatives about the Women in Treasury Annual Global Study results, moderated by Sophie Jackson, Joint Publisher &amp; Head of Strategic Content, Treasury Today Group.</p></div>

<h4 id="june-6th-2019-chicago">June 6<sup>th</sup> 2019 – Chicago</h4>
<p>June 6<sup>th</sup> marked the first time that Women in Treasury had touched down in Chicago. An inspiring message opened the event, as Christine Stokes, Managing Director at State Street Global Advisors and Director of Client Services for the Global Cash Business, informed the room of the progress that State Street Global Advisors has made in driving diversity and inclusion; following talks with over 1,200 companies about the importance of female board members, 423 had already added a woman to their boards.</p>
<p>Sophie Jackson then hosted a panel discussion between Mary Gilbert, MAFM Senior Accounting Manager, Duracell, and Kimberly Bethke, Director and Treasurer at CHPPOA. Focussing on the power of the mentor/mentee relationship, both Mary and Kimberly offered valuable advice about initiating and developing successful mentoring relationships, and emphasised the importance of both parties having each other’s best interests at heart.</p>
<p>The excitement at coming together to debate issues of diversity and inclusion was evident in the room and it was clear that this event had started an ongoing conversation in Chicago.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>This year’s annual SIBOS convention was held at the Excel Centre in London in September, and Treasury Today was delighted to take part in a discussion around diversity and inclusion in the finance sector. SIBOS TV caught up with Sophie Jackson, Joint Publisher and Head of Strategic Content at the Treasury Today Group, and leader of the Woman in Treasury initiative to explore the issue.</p>
<h4>Tell us about the Women in Treasury initiative - what is it, and how does it work?</h4>
<p>Women in Treasury was set up seven years ago. It began as a platform to celebrate women in our industry, starting with profiles of senior women in corporate finance. It incorporates a global study that we conduct every year, and now includes forums across the world, roundtables and conversations like we are having today. The conversation has really grown to talk about inclusion at all levels and diversity in all its forms.</p>
<h4>Treasury Today has just completed the Women in Treasury Global Study 2019. Can you tell us a little bit about its findings?</h4>
<p>This is our seventh year now and it’s a good moment to see what’s happened this year and compare it to the last year, and the previous years as well. Some of the big findings are that sadly 47% of our respondents from this year still feel that, in terms of pay parity they are not at the same level as their male colleagues at a similar level of seniority.</p>
<p>More encouragingly however, the majority feel that their companies are valuing and focusing on diversity and inclusion, but whether that’s resulting in real change is yet to be seen. When we look at top level representation, still only 8% of respondents have a female CEO while only 19% have a female CFO, so we are not really seeing these initiatives trickling upwards.</p>
<h4>So in seven years these dominant trends that you’ve picked up on haven’t moved at all?</h4>
<p>Well I think if we are being realistic about that, top level change will take a while. Those roles don’t become available very often, so we are not really looking at a host of new CEO roles that have become available in the last seven years. I think we need to look at the issue from the bottom, from when people are coming into organisations from the mid-level. So look at retention when people go on parental leave, and also giving access for men to parental leave as well, and in those areas we are seeing improvement.</p>
<h4>But certainly pay parity is the ongoing elephant in the room?</h4>
<p>Yes, but the issue is that with our respondents, their organisations may not have transparency on remuneration, so we don’t really know that it is true. The issue is a perception – there remains a perception for nearly half of our respondents that they are not valued as much as their male colleagues. What that really means in practice is perhaps that diversity and inclusion needs to be worked on. We need to have companies where everybody feels valued, where everybody feels that their voice is important.</p>
<h4>From your perspective, what are the other areas that still raise concerns for you that require attention?</h4>
<p>One of the things we have tried to do is not just acknowledge challenges but also give tools that can help women to get beyond them, so mentoring, sponsorship and coaching are absolutely critical. I think beyond that there seems to be an issue, which is more of a socialisation issue, that women are discouraged from putting their hands up I think societally, perhaps. So, this needs to be a journey that you go on both inside your organisation and within your career but also personally and thinking about how you might own some of your strengths and put them forward, so that’s something that I would like to see changed.</p>
<h4>How do you think these can be changed, how do you think they can be addressed?</h4>
<p>Well first of all it’s about asking for help when you need it. I think one of the things that we have tried to do is to understand what we really mean by mentoring, sponsorship and coaching. What are these tools that you can use and how might you go about getting them?</p>
<p>When we do our more intimate roundtable discussions, a lot of the time if people are in an organisation where there is not a structured development programme, it’s very hard for them to know where they can go and how they can get that help. So I would say the first thing that’s critical is being part of your community and being active. If your organisation is not helping you enough, go and get involved in your community, go and find networks like Women in Treasury, or whatever might be relevant to your profession and don’t be afraid to put your hand up and ask for help.</p>
<h4>How do you think things are likely to develop over the next two to three years? What are your expectations?</h4>
<p>You have to look backwards in order to look forwards. I think it’s amazing to see how far we have come in terms of talking about female representation. But what I hope to see happen going forward is that those women who are now in senior roles will think about their privilege and their access. What diversity and inclusion means in its truest form is that everybody has a seat at the table – not just women with a certain level of access. So I hope that we will now galvanise and make this about including everybody.</p>

<p>On 18<sup>th</sup> September, Treasury Today and State Street Global Advisors returned to the Garden Court Hotel in Palo Alto, California for an intimate lunchtime roundtable event with a group of treasury professionals. This was the second joint event at this striking location, and a welcome opportunity for attendees – many of whom work in the technology industry – to discuss issues around diversity and inclusion while continuing to build a strong network.</p>
<p>Pia McCusker, Senior Managing Director and Global Head Cash Management at State Street Global Advisors, welcomed participants and began the event with a description of the Women in Treasury programme to date. As Pia explained, “Together we’re working to provide a forum to discuss the evolution of the diversity dialogue in our industry.”</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury Palo Alto Roundtable 2019" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/roundtables-2019/2019-09-18-tt-00-wit__palo-alto__tnp_8907__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=8FB3A4C9662B946716017965C9512653" style="float:right;margin:0 0 2em 2em;"/>
<p>Sophie Jackson, Treasury Today Group’s Joint Publisher &amp; Head of Strategic Content, led an intimate panel discussion with three engaging and highly qualified experts: Anita Bubna, Senior Director, Treasury at Flex, and Treasury Today’s Highly Commended Woman of the Year in the 2019 Adam Smith Awards; Debdatta Banerjee, Senior Manager – Finance Systems at eBay (Payments) and Kevin Zimmerman, Vice President, Head of US Cash Direct Channel at State Street Global Advisors.</p>
<p>The panellists began by outlining the paths they had taken to reach their current roles. Anita explained how she had taken on many different roles in both technology and finance before she settled for a career in treasury which she has enjoyed for the last nine years. Of all her roles, Anita’s experience as an entrepreneur was particularly valuable and It helped her get comfortable with navigating uncertainty. It also taught her to persevere in the face of challenges.  The skills learned early in her career served as a strong foundation for a wide variety of roles that she has taken on.</p>
<p>Debdatta related how a benchmarking exercise when she was at Microsoft had led to her being offered the role of Senior Treasury Manager at eBay – and how she recently moved into her current role, which has given her the opportunity to learn about payments and ecommerce. She also spoke about her positive relationship with her mentor at Microsoft, who she said has both championed her cause and encouraged her to step out of her comfort zone.</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury Palo Alto Roundtable 2019" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/roundtables-2019/2019-09-18-tt-00-wit__palo-alto__tnp_8985__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=03033CAC88BF29A7CC7F4313DFCD7436" style="float:left;margin:0 2em 2em 0;"/>
<p>The conversation turned to the importance of diversity and inclusion in the workplace – and the role that male allies can play in overcoming the challenges faced by women. Kevin shared his thoughts on the steps that men can take to be effective allies, including the importance of being able to listen and receive feedback. The experts also spoke about the importance of broadening discussions on this topic to bring additional people – both men and women – into the conversation.</p>
<p>Questions raised by the audience sparked a discussion about challenges in the recruitment process and the steps that can be taken to ensure a diverse talent pipeline – from anonymising applications to rewriting job descriptions to avoid the overuse of keywords that might discourage female applicants from applying. On a related note, the experts spoke about the challenges that can arise when building a diverse workforce and the value of training to increase awareness of different personality types.</p>

<p>Following the panel discussion, Sophie gave a preview of the now-published results of the 2019 Women in Treasury Annual Global Study, with the data points providing a catalyst for attendees to share their own thoughts and experiences of the issues raised. There was widespread agreement that diversity can’t happen without inclusion, and that in order to be truly inclusive, a culture is needed where people will genuinely respect and welcome differing opinions. Participants also shared their experiences of navigating parental leave, from unwelcome comments about expressing breastmilk to the stigma fathers may face when taking leave.</p>
<p>Turning the spotlight to the topic of parity and representation, Sophie noted that support for quotas for female representation on boards has grown considerably in recent years. Participants spoke about the pros and cons of this approach and discussed other possible solutions, such as having programmes in place to identify and train women with a high potential to reach board level. Attendees also raised the important point that the criteria used for judging whether women are appropriate for board positions may be biased in the first place – meaning that the criteria themselves may need to be revisited.</p>
<p>In closing, Pia invited participants to share the ideas and messages they were planning to take away from the event. Many important points were raised, from changing perceptions about the value of board quotas to the value of transferable skills. Attendees left newly energised and inspired with ideas about how to further diversity and inclusion within their own organisations.</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p>This year saw 335 women completing Treasury Today’s Women in Treasury Study, with 61% of participants sharing their views for the first time. The largest proportion of participants (39%) were aged between 35-44 years old, while 52% of all respondents had worked in treasury for more than ten years – indicating a high level of experience among the women surveyed.</p>
<p>The 2019 study included responses from a wider geographic range than in previous years – for example, a third of this year’s responses came from the Americas, up from 18% in 2018. This larger and broader data set has provided an opportunity to gain an even more detailed understanding of the challenges faced by women in treasury at a global level.</p></div>

<blockquote>We would like to thank the 335 women in corporate treasury and finance who took the time to complete this year’s study. Your responses help us navigate the evolving landscape of diversity and inclusion within corporate treasury and allow us to measure the treasury profession’s path to greater representation.

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>The study asked a broad range of questions, focusing on issues ranging from female board representation in the companies polled to the gender pay gap. The number of respondents working for organisations with a female CEO has increased to 8% – a figure slightly higher than the 6.6% of Fortune 500 companies that currently have female CEOs. The study found that the proportion of participants working for a company with a female CFO to be 19%, compared to 24% in 2018. Shockingly, the number of respondents that believe they are not paid the same as men at a similar level of seniority has increased from 39% in 2018 to 47% this year. It is very clear that many women still perceive themselves to be less valued and appreciated in their organisations than men.</p>
<p>When asked if their organisations had diversity, inclusion and equal opportunity strategies in place, 70% of respondents replied in the affirmative. However, only 26% said that diversity, inclusion and equal opportunities were recognised as key performance indicators (KPIs) in their organisations.</p>
<p>Another important topic tackled by the Women in Treasury study is that of quotas for board representation. Every year, the study asks respondents whether they are in favour of introducing quotas for female representation on boards. Since the launch of the study there has been a steady rise in the proportion of women supporting such measures, while opposition has decreased. In 2014, for example, only 38% believed there should be quotas, with the same percentage opposed to the idea. This year, in contrast, 46% of women were in support of quotas, while only 29% were opposed.</p>
<p>When commenting on the reasons why quotas could have an important role to play, a key observation noted by several of the study’s participants was that change is not happening fast enough. As one participant stated, “I was of the view 15 years ago that a quota would be detrimental as I would not want to be the token woman, chosen only because I am a woman. However, progress has not been sufficiently made without quotas in the past two decades – so I feel quotas are now critical to make a difference.”</p>
<p>This observation supports the study’s findings that progress seems to have stagnated in certain areas. In light of this, it is more important than ever to encourage more dialogue about the challenges faced by women in treasury, and indeed by women in business. While this year has seen an improvement in the number of female CEOs in the Fortune 500 from 4.8% to 6.6%, this still only equates to 33 women out of 500 – giving some indication of the scale of the challenge ahead.</p>

<p>In the latest instalment of the Women in Treasury initiative, Treasury Today and State Street Global Advisors were welcomed to the Microsoft campus in Redmond, Washington, for a dynamic afternoon of insight and discussion.</p>
<p>Microsoft CFO Amy Hood opened the event, welcoming attendees to the campus, and commenting that treasury is a “hotbed of talent” and advising that more companies should regard their treasury functions as a great training ground for strong finance leaders.</p>
<p>Christine Stokes, Managing Director and Director of Client Services at State Street Global Advisors, explained that the firm has been partnering with Treasury Today since 2017 to host events around the globe and further the evolution of the diversity dialogue within the industry. She also described the work State Street Global Advisors has done in “using the voice of our proxy vote to help drive change”, adding that 577 companies as of July 2019 have now committed to adding a woman to their boards as a result of this action.</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury Seattle Roundtable 2019" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/roundtables-2019/2019-09-16-tt-00-wit__seattle__m41a9457__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=F05E4559F70C794BCEB835985B25F7FF" style="float:right;margin:0 0 2em 2em;"/>
<p>Next came an insightful panel discussion, with five highly qualified speakers sharing a wealth of experience. Theresa Whitmarsh, Executive Director at Washington State Investment Board, set the tone of the conversation with her assertion that “if you’re a woman in a position of influence and power, you have an absolute obligation to use that to help other women.” She described her experience of being invited to the World Economic Forum at Davos, where she often found herself to be the “only woman in the room”. She explained that this had led to productive conversations with private equity partners and subsequent initiatives to overcome industry challenges.</p>
<p>Anita Mehra, VP Worldwide Payment Solutions at Microsoft, spoke of the importance of being an ‘ally’. She referenced to the allyship model of Dr. Kenji Yoshino, in this regard. The idea is to progress from ally to one to an ally to all. This requires one to suspend ‘judgement’ and use any such situation, as an opportunity to help others learn. She also said that it is important for us as women, to be conscious of and support men and women who may be experiencing discrimination.”</p>

<p>Jennifer Ceran related the path she had taken to reach her current role as CFO of Smartsheet, noting that her original goal had been to serve as treasurer for a Fortune 500 company – a role that she held at eBay for eight years. She recommended that those who have set their sights on a CFO role should aim to achieve a breadth of experience in two or three areas of finance. She also emphasised the importance of persevering and overcoming any setbacks that may occur.</p>
<p>Turning to the topic of corporate cultures, Laura Smith, Vice President, Treasurer, Pension, Credit &amp; Risk at Weyerhaeuser, spoke about the different cultures she had experienced in her current and previous roles. Asked for her advice about career advancement, Laura warned against the temptation to create a persona for a potential employer, advising that people “find the employer that leverages all the things you’re great at.” And Kevin Zimmerman, VP, Head of US Cash Direct Channel at State Street Global Advisors, provided valuable insights into how men can play a role in improving diversity of thought and representation across the organisation.</p>
<p>The panellists also gave their perspectives on how to pursue career opportunities, from the importance of being able to advocate for yourself to the value of leveraging a strong network of sponsors, as the panel defined as people in a position of power who may be able to help drive opportunities. Laura also spoke of the knowledge that can be gleaned from informational interviews, noting that this approach had enabled her to gain clarity over which path she wanted to pursue.</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury Seattle Roundtable 2019" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/roundtables-2019/2019-09-16-tt-00-wit__seattle__m41a9380__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=7FFCE8A5B24AB5689E15ABEFEB7A1402" style="float:right;margin:0 0 2em 2em;"/>
<p>Following the panel discussion, Sophie Jackson, Joint Publisher &amp; Head of Strategic Content, Treasury Today Group, gave a preview of the recently published findings of the 2019 Treasury Today Women in Treasury Study. Attendees discussed a range of topics, from the value of mentoring relationships – and how to secure such relationships – to flexible working, parental leave and the pros and cons of quotas for board representation.</p>
<p>In closing, Christine thanked the panellists for their insights and encouraged participants to share what they had learned from the discussions. Notable takeaways included a greater understanding of the distinction between mentorship and sponsorship, the importance of leading by example in taking advantage of flexible working arrangements, and the value of fostering an ongoing dialogue in the workplace.</p>
<p>A very special thank you to Amy Hood, George Zinn, Anita Mehra, Meri Colistro and the entire Microsoft team for co-hosting and bringing Women in Treasury to Microsoft.</p>

<p>On 20<sup>th</sup> August, Treasury Today’s Women in Treasury programme came to Australia for the first time with an inaugural Women in Treasury lunch in partnership with Westpac. The lunch was held at Tower 2 in Sydney’s waterfront Barangaroo destination, where corporate finance professionals gathered to discuss the pressing issues affecting women finance professionals in 2019.</p>
<p>Introducing the event, Jeff Byrne, Westpac’s Head of Specialised Sales, Global Transaction Services, emphasised the importance of this topic not only for women, but also for men in the industry. He pointed out that while progress is being made – Westpac, for example, is approaching a 50:50 split for men and women in leadership roles – one in five of Australia’s largest corporations won’t achieve gender parity in the next five years.</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury Westpac Roundtable 2019" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/roundtables-2019/2019-08-20-tt-00-wit__west-pac__26__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=798319737A761D7EEE258ED4B672A00C" style="float:right;margin:0 0 2em 2em;"/>
<p>Focusing on Westpac’s achievements in this area, Jeff related the progress made so far as a result of the bank’s Equilibrium programme, which focuses on recruiting women from a range of industries. “In any role we want to replace, the panel of people interviewing, and the pool of interviewees, must both be 50:50 women,” he added. “These policies have built in a sustained culture of inclusion and diversity.”</p>
<p>Next up was Besa Deda, Chief Economist of St. George Banking Group and one of very few female chief economists in Australia. She took attendees on what she described as a “whirlwind tour of what’s going on in financial markets and the economy”, noting that the IMF has already cut its world growth forecast three times this year. That said, Besa pointed out that the current forecast is based on assumptions that trade tensions will dissipate – adding that she is more pessimistic on this point. Besa also discussed developments in the US and the recent reduction in the Fed funds target rate, adding that while this had been presented as a mid-policy adjustment, markets were currently pricing in more aggressive easing.</p>

<p>Turning to the Australian economy, she told attendees that the Reserve Bank of Australia’s rate cuts in June and July were expected to be followed with further rate cuts in the coming months. She also said that “the conversation has moved to unconventional policies”, which could take the form of a package of policies such as buying government or corporate bonds, or term funding, whereby banks can access cheaper funding from the RBA and thereby provide lower borrowing rates.</p>
<p>Moving the spotlight to the topic of diversity and inclusion, Sophie Jackson, Treasury Today Group’s Joint Publisher &amp; Head of Strategic Content, presented the findings of the 2018 Women in Treasury Global Study in an interactive session. Attendees were invited to discuss gender diversity and what is meant by ‘diversity and inclusion’. Many noted the importance of accommodating people of different backgrounds, experiences, ages and beliefs.</p>
<p>Sophie also sought attendees’ views on mentoring, noting that the 2018 study had found that 79% of respondents identified mentoring, sponsorship and coaching as being key to a successful career. Participants shared their own experiences of mentoring arrangements and explained how these had enabled them to tap into unbiased opinions and different perspectives. One common thread was an emphasis on the value of informal arrangements that can evolve organically, as opposed to formal arrangements that may sometimes have a limited shelf life.</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury Westpac Roundtable 2019" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/roundtables-2019/2019-08-20-tt-00-wit__west-pac__40__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=3F19F6C40540136B51005B389B25BF69" style="float:right;margin:0 0 2em 2em;"/>
<p>The discussion turned to flexible working arrangements and parental leave. One of the participants spoke of the perceived stigma attached to leaving work early, even when an arrangement has been agreed. In contrast, another related her experience of proactively finding a retired male professional to join her in a job share arrangement, and how she successfully proposed the scheme to management.</p>
<p>Sophie commented that female representation and parity continue to present significant challenges, with 39% of participants in the survey believing that they are not paid the same as their equivalent male counterparts. This prompted a discussion about the use of quotas, which have seen growing support in recent years – an observation that was reinforced by one participant who had changed her mind about the need for quotas after seeing that other approaches hadn’t delivered the necessary traction.</p>
<p>Summarising the afternoon’s discussion, Jeff observed that the lunch had given rise to some interesting conversations about topics such as inclusion and diversity, flexibility, mentoring and wellbeing. “All in all, a really good session and a great community being built here,” he concluded.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p><em>In the first of our ‘Ask an Expert’ series we speak to Elizabeth St-Onge, a Partner with Oliver Wyman Financial Services and a specialist in helping financial institutions evaluate and refine their corporate conduct and culture.</em></p>
<h4>How would you define corporate culture?</h4>
<p>I think it can be very hard to define. Often a company will point to its mission statement, value statements or code of conduct when asked about corporate culture. In a perfect world, corporate culture should align with these expressions – but in reality, it might not.</p>
<p>Loosely speaking, corporate culture is what people instinctively know to be acceptable – or unacceptable – within their organisation, regardless of what is written down as a value or mission statement. It is what people understand to be ‘the way we work or how we do things’. It is the behaviours that the organisation rewards and celebrates, and those that the organisation frowns upon or does not align with.</p>
<p>Corporate culture therefore constitutes the unwritten rules for how we do things. And unfortunately, this can be different from the stated values of the organisation.</p>
<h4>What makes for a good or a bad corporate culture?</h4>
<p>Good and bad cultures are hard to define because there is no single idea of what is ‘good’ or ‘bad’. You could visit many different organisations and experience vastly different cultures; it is never a case of having that singular ‘good’ culture and all else is ‘bad’.</p>
<p>What is really important is that there is a connection between the stated culture and the actual culture. It is important that senior management is explicit about what the company’s culture and values are – and that this understanding is clear across the organisation. For instance, a lot of organisations say ‘we put the customer first,’ without explaining what this means in practice. Does it mean always doing what the customer wants, no matter what? Or does it mean having the customers’ best interests in mind? Or, perhaps, saying no to the customer if they are asking for something that is not appropriate?</p>
<p>The reality of what it means to live up to an organisation’s stated values is a lot harder than it first appears and dissemination of corporate culture takes a lot of work. Throughout any organisation, culturally there is nothing worse than when an individual is allowed to behave badly because they are a high-performer. Senior leadership and management must be clear on what is and is not tolerable, and this must be upheld even if the individual’s performance is exceptional.</p>
<h4>What is the relationship between corporate culture and the conversation around gender diversity?</h4>
<p>There is a relationship, but it is hard to argue that it amounts to causation. I would add that it is all about diversity, not just gender, because generally, organisations that have diversity are inclusive of people who are different in terms of gender, ethnicity, background, language, education and so on.</p>
<p>Some organisations are good at not only bringing in diverse people, but also giving them a voice. By doing so, they are enabling individuals to be themselves and experience ‘psychological safety’, a place where they can express their full selves and be truthful. Such organisations are generally clear on what their values are. Supporting diversity can mean that if organisational culture starts to slip –perhaps when there is too much ‘group think’, or if people make assumptions – people are generally better at calling it out. A diverse group of people asks more questions, challenges each other in a good way, and has more discussions.</p>
<h4>Many companies are having to shift from an old-style corporate culture to a new, more inclusive one. What is involved in this process?</h4>
<p>Many of the organisations that we work with have had to look at their culture due to a scandal or specific cultural breakdowns. Many also are taking culture more seriously, not because they have experienced specific issues but because they realise that a healthy culture leads to better outcomes for clients, employees and shareholders. Companies are beginning to realise that they must take care of culture on an ongoing and active basis. It’s like tending a garden: you can’t just plant the seeds and leave them to grow; you have to look after them.</p>
<p>There is a variety of things organisations need to consider when changing. Have we been explicit in our aims? Are we clear on what we value and how we expect our employees to behave? A lot of organisations in the past have made assumptions that these points were clear, when in fact they were not. A great way to test this is to survey a group of employees and clients and ask, ‘what do we stand for?’ and ‘what are our core values?’ If the responses are very different from one another, then the organisation is not clear on culture and expectations.</p>
<p>Training middle management is something more large organisations are realising they need to do. The tone from the top can be great, but is middle management aligned with that tone? This is vital because, for the average employee, it’s not the tone from the top that matters so much as the tone much closer to home. They will observe the level above, or two levels above, asking ‘how do they act, how do they behave and what do they believe’? They do this because the actions of these people will impact them in their day-to-day job far more than those of the CEO.</p>
<p>Organisations must constantly and proactively manage culture. It’s not a one-time thing; it evolves. As the world around us changes – as customers change and as a business changes – we adopt new technologies, for example, helping more employees work from home. It’s changes such as these that shift organisational culture, and they need to be managed.</p>
<h4>If good corporate culture is important to an individual, what should they look for when joining an organisation?</h4>
<p>There are two different approaches to this. They should certainly start by taking a look at the mission statement of the company, trying to get a feel for its values. Then they can dive beneath that and start probing the facts. For instance, they could ask about diversity and inclusion statistics. How diverse is the senior leadership team? How diverse is the team that they will be joining? Has that firm made progress over the last few years? Have targets or stated goals around diversity and inclusion been met?</p>
<p>They should also ask about turnover in the team that they are going to join. How long have people typically been on a team, and what is its rate of turnover? A team composed of people who have been there for a long time tells you that it’s a positive place to work. But the presence of relative newcomers indicates that it welcomes new blood and different ways of thinking about and doing things.</p>
<p>Individuals should also try to speak to people who would be their peers in the role, or people who will be on their team. Ask specific questions around the culture such as: ‘What behaviours are rewarded in this organisation?’ ‘What behaviours are frowned upon?’ ‘How does the organisation react when someone makes a mistake or an error?’ ‘Do you “shoot the messenger”?’ ‘Is self-identification, speaking up or voicing a dissenting opinion welcomed or frowned upon?’ Answers to these types of questions can tell you a lot about corporate culture.</p>
<h4>How can we, as employees, help bring about a positive corporate culture?</h4>
<p>Anyone who is in a management role obviously has more influence and power. But at every level of the organisation, it is essential to have an understanding of what the firm stands for, to ensure that we are all living up to those values every day, and to see that the decisions and actions that we take are in line with those values.</p>
<p>When you are being asked to do something that goes against the organisation’s stated values, you should raise those issues and speak out. Do not be afraid of calling out conflicts or issues that are not in line with the culture. At the same time, I think there has to be a culture that allows people to learn from their mistakes.</p>

<p>First, let’s consider the difference between a mentor and a sponsor. A mentor is someone who can offer insights and guidance to a more junior person, be it in their career or in a different setting. A sponsor is someone who actively advocates on behalf of a more junior person, offering public support and advocacy to help advance the career or position of that person, either within or outside their organisation.</p>
<p>If I were looking for a mentor, I’d look for someone who has a good overview of the industry. I’d want someone who can provide guidance on both the type of role, for example relationship management, technology, or strategy; as well as offering thoughts on different areas or organisations in the industry that might be considered to round out my resume. I’d look for someone whose experience and judgement I respect, but that may be very different from my own, so I may learn from them in developing my own career.</p>
<p>One concept I really like, is that of the ‘personal board of directors’. This is a handful of people you invite to help guide you through your career, and possibly other areas of your life. You can select people from within your professional network, as well as from your personal network, whose advice you value, and who can offer you different perspectives for consideration. You might set a goal of meeting or speaking with each of them either at set intervals (starting with semi-annually), or on an ad hoc basis as the need arises. When inviting people to this role, you should be clear what you are requesting, both in terms of the type of advice and relationship you are seeking, as well as the term of the ‘board role’.</p>
<p>I’d suggest three ways one might seek a mentor. First would be through a formal or informal mentorship programme. Second, would be to seek informal mentorship from a more senior person in your organisation. This could be done simply by inviting the person for a coffee or breakfast, and requesting career advice. I suspect there would be very few people who would decline the offer, but please respect the polite declines, as it likely indicates the person feels they are not able to commit quality time to a new mentoring relationship. If the coffee meeting goes well, you could suggest quarterly or semi-annual meetings going forward. It is important to respect the very high value of these people’s time.</p>
<p>Third, you could set up your own peer mentoring group. I’d do this by inviting perhaps three like-minded friends or colleagues, who are at a similar career stage, and suggest perhaps monthly or quarterly meetings outside office hours, to share career challenges. You may want to set some guidelines, such as Chatham House Rules, to guide the discussions, to maintain confidentiality of the discussions.</p>
<p>It is important to bear in mind that mentorship is a two way street, in that both the mentor and the mentee should gain value. The mentee gains insights and guidance from the mentor. The mentor benefits from the concept of reverse mentorship, by learning from the mentee about career challenges they face, as well as the perspectives of someone who is at an earlier stage in their career. The mentor can then take these learnings to make changes in their organisation to be more welcoming to a new generation, as well as adjusting the mentor’s own leadership style to be more relevant and supportive to the rising stars in the industry.  Another way mentors can benefit from the relationship, is by tapping into the network of the mentee, when seeking to hire new talent.</p>
<p>In all cases, it is extremely important to respect the value of your mentor’s time, and to come to each discussion with a clear agenda, so you can both learn from the relationship.</p>

<p>Yang Xu is the Vice President and Global Treasurer of Kraft Heinz, a US$26bn publicly listed global food company. Having worked in various roles across treasury, M&amp;A, strategy, finance, sales and marketing and operations in many different countries, Yang believes the best treasury professionals drive value through business partnership and cross functional acumen, and differentiate by defining and delivering the optimal capital structure of a company. Yang holds a Masters degree of Business Administration from HEC School of Paris and London Business School, and is a native of China.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4>How did you arrive in your current position?</h4>
<p>I studied finance for many years. After my MBA, I started my career with Whirlpool as an analyst in a treasury centre for Europe and Asia, based in Belgium at that time. I was working on cash management and FX. It’s a fascinating area to apply financial market knowledge and to understand business fundamentals. After a couple of years, I was transferred to the US for pension/401(k) redesign after a transformational M&amp;A.</p>
<p>Following my debut in treasury, I asked for and was given many different roles in general finance including M&amp;A and FP&amp;A in different functions in the US. Thereafter, I was further assigned with overseas positions in the EMEA headquarters in Italy, sales and marketing roles in China, and operations roles in Hong Kong and Taiwan. I returned to the global treasury function back in the US, and a couple of years later I decided to make a big jump and joined Kraft Heinz to take on my current role, which focuses heavily on strategy and leadership. I deeply appreciate the intellectual challenges of leading our global treasury function.</p>
<h4>What is the biggest challenge you are facing now as a corporate treasurer?</h4>
<p>My passion resides in joining the force to shape the future of Kraft Heinz. I love the company’s speed of decision-making and the culture of ownership, which means that employees at all levels feel empowered to make meaningful contributions.</p>
<p>I love being able to discuss and plan capital structure and allocation with senior executives and the board of directors. This requires deeper understanding of the industry, business trajectory, cash projections, and optimal cost of capital structure. Once those directions are set, it’s fulfilling to see the effects unfold.</p>
<p>All industries and companies today have phases, and the macroeconomy is constantly evolving. It requires clear direction, alignment and fine tuning of the plan, as well as constant communication with the rating agencies and investors.</p>
<p>I also define and drive major transactions. Billion-dollar transactions require collaboration with tax, accounting, legal, and various business functions. They enable learning and understanding far beyond the treasury function.</p>
<h4>What is the best piece of advice that you have been given in your career?</h4>
<p>To give less than your best is a waste of talent. When you have multiple career choices, choose the harder one that pushes you out of your comfort zone. It’s important to build a set of values because that’s what ultimately defines you. My own maxim for life is ‘never stop learning’.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4 id="team-builder">Team builder</h4>
<p>One of the major objectives for Yang is to continuously build a stronger team and improve processes. In the past, she says treasury has been characterised by its technical expertise. This will remain the foundation of the function. But she also wants to balance this, serving the business more effectively by encouraging a broader outlook.</p>
<p>“Connecting the dots,” she says, can be achieved either by bringing in people who have “lived in the business”, or by rotating treasury professionals out to the business, using cross-functional initiatives as a platform, building on their organisational understanding and experience, and developing a wider set of contacts.</p>
<p>“It’s good to be proud of our function but sometimes we can be so focused on what we do that we build barriers,” she comments. “I tell people that first we serve the good of the whole company but then our key stakeholders are the other functions.” Engaging in open discussion is vital in any cross-functional initiative because taking the narrowed view of one function can have unintended up- and downstream consequences. Yang believes treasurers with wide exposure to their business will be better positioned to examine the potential wider consequences of their actions, and better serve the organisation.</p>
<p>This willingness to learn is part of what makes Yang successful – and no source of learning is off limits. Throughout her career, she has carried with her a notebook. She has populated these (she’s on her third now) with the wisdom of others and also with her own thoughts, and those of her colleagues. As each role within her career draws to a close, she puts aside a page for reflection. Likes and dislikes, points for improvement and personal successes have all found their way into this review. Yang uses this to help direct her next steps.</p>
<h4 id="strength-in-people">Strength in people</h4>
<p>Yang has a talent for making connections and better understanding the motivations of her colleagues. It helps her management style and, at the junior end of the spectrum, has helped her “take a risk on talent” to great effect.</p>
<p>Indeed, in her view of millennials as “more vocal, more open to learning, and more willing to challenge” than her own generation, she recognises in them the need for encouragement, offering it in the form of genuine ownership and independence. But she also knows to set clear parameters to offset their lack of experience.</p>
<p>Yang recognises vaulting ambition in herself and admits that in a previous role, she wasn’t quite ready. Although recognised as an emerging talent, she felt she lacked the “maturity and experience”. Surrounded by vastly more experienced people, she found the environment slightly intimidating.</p>
<p>As an Asian woman moving into Europe, where experience and longevity is highly valued and difficult to relinquish, “it was a struggle,” she confesses. “At times I was not assertive or artful enough. I didn’t push back or properly prioritise.” Nonetheless, she sought out opportunities and brought much-needed clarity to a complex environment. This was appreciated at head office.</p>
<p>Fortitude is a characteristic in which Yang excels. Having been born and brought up in China, in the one-child policy era, where almost 80% of women participated in the workforce, she “always had the impression that women were at least equal to men”.</p>
<p>However, in her transition to Western culture, she was “shocked” by the realisation that many women did not work. She rails against socially- or self-imposed ideas that women and men may not be equals, yet having toured many countries, she identifies a problem. “When I was expecting, the conversation always turned to my personal rather than professional life. Having had my daughter, I felt pressure to return to work early and then needed to work so much harder to prove myself.”</p>
<p>Yang was fortunate in having a couple of strong senior role models to demonstrate the reality of working motherhood. “They taught me not to judge by presence in the office but by the level of engagement and quality of work. It forced me to make better choices and to be flexible.”</p>
<p>Yang is understandably keen to impart her view to new talent that a work/life balance is possible. “It requires more prioritisation, advanced planning and higher efficiency, but it can be done. It’s not a single choice question.”</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p><em>On Thursday April 11<sup>th</sup> Treasury Today Group’s Women in Treasury Singapore Forum 2019 took place at the prestigious Four Seasons hotel from 12 noon to 4:30pm. This highly popular annual industry event is firmly established in the diaries of women and men across the Asia Pacific region and was attended by record numbers of people from all sectors of the industry.</em></p>
<p>The Forum opened at noon with a lively pre-lunch welcome reception which included an opening speech from Sophie Jackson, Joint Publisher &amp; Head of Strategic Content, Treasury Today Group. Commenting on the day, Sophie said, “It’s never felt more important to be here today to celebrate women in our industry. I’ve been delighted to see the fantastic representation for women there is here in Singapore at senior levels in corporate treasury and finance and the support from our community here for the Women in Treasury initiative really has been overwhelming! It’s been fantastic to see how our community and Forums here have grown year on year and to see the relationships and conversations that have been formed as a result.”</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury Singapore Forum 2019" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/singapore-2019/2019-07-08-tta-04-wit__047__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=7D380C308E78BD5C945CB95613FB98EF" style="float:left;margin:0 2em 2em 0;" width="200"/>
<p>Treasury Today’s Women in Treasury initiative was established to pioneer women in the corporate treasury and finance industry and to create a new professional community where women can come together with each other and with male allies to share their experiences and encourage each other’s professional development. Singapore has a vibrant and active corporate treasury community which has been supportive of the Women in Treasury initiative since the beginning. The dynamic event was a fantastic opportunity to come together again and to reflect on how the initiative and the global dialogue around diversity and inclusion has grown and expanded.</p>
<p>The Women in Treasury initiative is composed of a number of different elements; the first is the Women in Treasury Study, the only global study looking at women in corporate treasury and charting their professional journey and experiences in the workplace. The second is regular profiles of female corporate finance professionals within the This Much I Know feature. There is a dedicated LinkedIn Women in Treasury network and a Woman of the Year category within our Adam Smith Awards global programme. There is the newly launched Within community resource for women in treasury which offers advice, tips and inspiration on a regular basis for the women in treasury global community. Finally, there are our Women in Treasury roundtables and forums which now take place across the US, Europe and Asia Pacific. The Women in Treasury initiative is constantly growing and expanding, driven forward by the women and men who are part of our community and lend their voices to our conversations around diversity, inclusion and representation in corporate treasury.</p>

<p>At the heart of the Women in Treasury initiative is the annual Women in Treasury Global Study which Meg Coates, Joint Publisher &amp; Head of Operations, Treasury Today Group, spoke about in her opening presentation, summarising the broad findings of our Women in Treasury Global Study 2018, proudly supported by State Street Global Advisors. The data from the study forms the basis of Treasury Today’s analysis of gender representation, diversity and inclusion in corporate treasury. The 2018 study was conducted from May to September 2018. The study attracted 348 responses from a broad universe in terms of age, experience, geography and role, with over half of respondents completing the study for the first time, offering a new data set with some eye-opening results.</p></div>

<p>Over a quarter of respondents to Treasury Today’s Women in Treasury Study 2018 have felt overlooked and ignored in the workplace because of their gender.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>The majority of respondents were aged between 35 and 54. Forty seven percent had dependent children and 17% had other dependents. The voices reflected in the 2018 results were those of women who have dedicated a significant part of their career to the treasury profession, with more than half holding a treasury role for over ten years. Respondents outlined for the first time what the term diversity means to them. Here are some examples:</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury Singapore Forum 2019" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/singapore-2019/2019-07-08-tta-04-wit__008__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=A2E9D6BD4DB0D513318AA0B69CFC92BD" style="float:left;margin:0 2em 2em 0;" width="200"/>
<p>‘Diversity means the freedom to bring your full self to work, not having to feel you have to excuse yourself for who you are.’ ‘If our work culture is not inclusive, we never achieve diversity. Diversity is perceiving difference; inclusion is valuing it.’</p>
<p>On the topic of gender parity regarding pay and opportunities, 49% of respondents said they felt they earnt less than their male counterparts. Only 5% felt there had been improvements in pay parity over the past year and over a quarter of respondents have felt overlooked and ignored in the workplace because of their gender.</p>
<p>The welcome reception was followed by a three-course lunch in the sumptuous Crescent Ballroom, during which the panel discussion took place on stage with our leading industry speakers. The dynamic and insightful debate was moderated by Sophie Jackson and featured our superb line up of influential panellists with a wide-ranging set of experiences from across the industry.</p>
<p>Our panellists were Catherine Yu, VP Regional Controller APAC &amp; China, Herbalife Nutrition, Lay Perk Toh, Corporate Treasurer, Kulicke &amp; Soffa, Yeng Butler, Senior Managing Director and Global Head of Cash Business, State Street Global Advisors and Jason Horn, Head of the Asia Pacific Cash &amp; Short Duration Liquidity Business, BlackRock. The candid and thought-provoking discussion explored the views of the panel on some of the issues highlighted by the respondents of the study and the ongoing challenges to the progress of diversity in our industry, as well as practical career tips and motivational messages for both women and men working in the treasury function today.</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury Singapore Forum 2019" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/singapore-2019/2019-07-08-tta-04-wit__061__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=859472CC38DBA215326247DE20BBDD2D" style="float:right;margin:0 0 2em 2em;" width="200"/>
<p>Yeng spoke about her beginnings in finance and her wide-ranging experience at Merrill Lynch, where she moved across to asset management. Following ten years at Merrill Lynch and with an interest in the intersection of the public and private sector, instead of pursuing an MBA, Yeng took a Masters in public administration at Harvard. During this time she spent six months in Western Samoa working in microfinance which made low value loans to women who were looking to start small businesses to fund their families and education for their children. For Yeng this was an incredibly rewarding experience. A decade ago, Yeng was recruited back to Boston to build out a global team at State Street Global Advisors and she hasn’t looked back since!</p>
<p>Catherine began her career after studying corporate finance in university. Despite wanting to go into investment banking, her CV suited CPA and after having children she worked for a pharmaceutical company where she learnt the ropes of a corporate multinational environment. Moving to Merck, she took roles in different parts of the finance function and then she moved into treasury before heading across to BT’s APAC office as a Regional Treasurer. Then followed an MBA from Manchester Business School which she finished within 18 months whilst balancing the demands of a family. This drive to build a professional network set her up well to move across to Herbalife Nutrition, where she now manages more than 150 people. ‘Every day you have someone to learn from. Keep that in your suitcase and then you can keep that knowledge and that has really been important.’</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>For Lay Perk, there was an opportunity for a regional treasury manager at Honeywell which she was willing to undertake, despite having no previous experience of treasury. This willingness to learn has propelled Lay Perk over the course of more than a decade’s experience in treasury. “Every profession is unique and special. We all bring value to the organisation in our own way. Treasury for me, is something I have passion doing, and we make our profession ‘special’. I enjoy every single part of my job, especially providing solutions to streamline and automate to drive higher level of efficiency across various functions in the organisation. You can make a very big difference with a small team, which many of us have!”</p>

<p>Jason offered his perspective as a male ally, driving forward an agenda of diversity and inclusion as he leads his team and seeks to impact the broader industry. “It’s great to be up on the stage with these fantastic female leaders. The financial services industry has been typically male dominated, especially in the early stage of my career.” Since joining BlackRock in 2016, Jason has noticed how the firm and the industry have made meaningful changes to address this balance.</p>
<p>The panellists discussed what diversity and inclusion actually means, with the concepts of meritocracy, access and hiring all being raised. Returning talent to the workforce and equal access to parental leave which is in a nascent stage in Asia were also topics of discussion on the day. Following the panel discussion, an enthusiastic open question and answer session took place, with many members of the audience taking the opportunity to share their own experiences and seek advice from the panel. “As more and more companies offer parental leave it would be fantastic to see more males take it, as it normalises the traditional responsibilities of the mother, that a father can take their children to the doctor or to a playdate.” The panellists agreed that destigmatising male access to parental leave is imperative for gender equality.</p>

<p>Catherine’s advice to everyone regardless of industry is, “Be mindful and continue to advance yourself through continuous learning. Nowadays there is so much disruptive technology, so keep learning from different experts who can help you to be successful.”</p>
<p>There was a powerful human side to the conversation on the day, as Lay Perk spoke about overcoming a car accident in which she was left blind, and her journey to recovery. Lay Perk learnt a lot about accepting the severity of situations that may occur in our personal or professional lives and the importance of staying focused on our future aims. Lay Perk has gone on to speak to school children about the lessons she learnt from her biggest personal challenge. “Strive for the best, while preparing for the worst,” is the lesson she learnt from this.</p>
<p>Summing up the day, Sophie said, “Over the past seven years that we have been working on our initiative, one thing that I’ve noticed is how often we come back to the idea of human qualities. Not many people think about the human qualities of kindness, empathy and nurturing for example, but these are what make us special as individuals and we bring these unique qualities to our professional lives. Take some time to think about the things that make you unique and special and consider how you might amplify them and build on them, rather than ignoring or overlooking them and seeking to emulate other business leaders. Becoming the best and most authentic version of ourselves will reap rewards in both your professional and personal lives.”</p>

<p>On 13<sup>th</sup> June, Treasury Today and State Street Global Advisors came to Boston for the next instalment of their joint Women in Treasury initiative. The event took the form of an engaging and thought-provoking afternoon of discussion at the Four Seasons Hotel.</p>
<p>Opening the event, State Street Global Advisors and Sophie Jackson, Treasury Today’s Joint Publisher &amp; Head of Strategic Content, explained the purpose of the Women in Treasury programme. Noting that smaller events can lead to richer conversations and more candour, the events are intended to help attendees make connections, share best practices across the industry and facilitate networking. It’s also about driving change, inviting participants to use the afternoon to glean actionable ideas.</p>
<img alt=" Women in Treasury Boston Roundtable 2019" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/roundtables-2019/2019-06-13-tt-00-wit__boston__118__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=3B05DAE1343284BF0A3334AA45489561" style="float:right;margin:0 0 2em 2em;"/>
<p>Next came an inspirational panel discussion with Elena P LaFrance, Treasurer of Alkermes; Jamie Cortas, Director Global Investment Management at Dell, and Natasha Dayaramani, Managing Director, Global Head of Portfolio Strategy, Outsourced CIO at State Street Global Advisors. All three women have built highly successful careers within the industry, and offered participants a wealth of insights and advice on how to get ahead.</p>
<p>Elena talked candidly about the proactive approach she has taken to progress her career. She spoke of the value of applying for roles without necessarily having all the required qualifications, explaining how following this advice had led to her building a treasury department from the ground up – and, more recently, being named Treasury Today’s Woman of the Year in 2018. She also described how becoming a mother had led to a greater understanding of the need for work-life balance.</p>
<p>Jamie talked about the importance of having the right attitude alongside the necessary technical skills. She also discussed the need for cultivating strong relationships with everyone from colleagues and managers to banking partners and auditors. “These relationships – no matter what lens you look at them through – they matter,” she commented. “So you have to put in some effort. You never know when they’ll need you, or when you’ll need them.”</p>
<img alt=" Women in Treasury Boston Roundtable 2019" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/roundtables-2019/2019-06-13-tt-00-wit__boston__034__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=FD60ECBC0358C73BCCFFA6334EA16F9A" style="float:left;margin:0 2em 2em 0;"/>
<p>Focusing on diversity and inclusion, Natasha shared her insights on the importance of the language used in job descriptions. She explained that the firm has changed the way job descriptions are written and is using a tool to analyse and adjust the language used to attract a more diverse pool of applicants. Natasha also talked about unconscious bias, emphasising the need to put in place processes to check whether unconscious bias is affecting a particular conversation or decision.</p>
<p>After a short break, Sophie Jackson, Treasury Today’s Joint Publisher &amp; Head of Strategic Content, invited participants to take part in a lively discussion inspired by the findings of the 2018 Women in Treasury Global Study, supported by State Street Global Advisors.</p>
<p>On the topic of flexible working arrangements, participants agreed that such arrangements can only really succeed if the workplace is genuinely supportive, so that people will be comfortable taking advantage of the opportunities on offer.</p>
<img alt=" Women in Treasury Boston Roundtable 2019" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/roundtables-2019/2019-06-13-tt-00-wit__boston__129__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=BC8987DFAE8A5AAA7833C6A052BAE767" style="float:right;margin:0 0 2em 2em;"/>
<p>The conversation also explored the difficulties women may encounter when taking maternity leave. One attendee spoke positively of an initiative that enabled women to keep in touch with their workplace more effectively, noting that this had led to better retention after people returned to their roles. But conversely, other women spoke about their negative experiences of taking on too much work during their maternity leave.</p>
<p>The topic of board quotas likewise attracted a diverse range of views, with Sophie noting that 44% of the study’s respondents were in favour of quotas for female representation. Some attendees spoke about the drawbacks of quotas – including concerns that women may feel they need to work even harder to prove that they deserve their roles. But participants also voiced the idea that without an organic improvement in female representation, some sort of disruption would be needed. As one person commented, “You have to crowbar your way in.”</p>
<p>State Street Global Advisors has used its proxy voting power to pressure companies into improving female representation on their boards, with 423 companies adding a woman to their board since 2017 as a result. Participants were invited to share their action points arising from the event, with many saying they planned to support flexible working more wholeheartedly, review the language used in their own job descriptions or seek out mentees following the afternoon’s discussions.</p>

<p>For the last two years, Treasury Today and State Street Global Advisors have held a variety of joint Women in Treasury events in a number of cities and continents. On 6th June it was time to bring the initiative to Chicago, with an afternoon of insightful learning and vibrant discussion at the Ritz-Carlton hotel.</p>
<p>Christine Stokes, Managing Director at State Street Global Advisors and Director of Client Services for the Global Cash Business, began the event with an update on the progress the firm has already made in driving diversity and inclusion. Following talks with over 1,200 companies about the importance of including women on their boards, she noted that 423 have already added a woman to their boards – an encouraging result.</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury Chicago Roundtable 2019" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/roundtables-2019/2019-06-06-tt-00-wit__chicago__040__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=EBF827ADE1487955AF80B7A03252DC78" style="float:right;margin:0 0 2em 2em;"/>
<p>Turning to the theme of the day, Christine also talked about the role that mentorship can play in helping women shape their careers, explaining that she has personally participated in the firm’s mentor programme “both as mentor and mentee”.</p>
<p>The value of a successful mentoring relationship was then explored in detail with an intimate panel discussion with Mary Gilbert, MAFM Senior Accounting Manager at Duracell and Kimberly Bethke, Director and Treasurer at CHPPOA. Kimberly recounted how she had been tasked with hiring a new finance division following Berkshire Hathaway’s acquisition of Duracell in 2016. She explained how recruiting Mary as Treasury Manager had marked the beginning of a close relationship that has continued even after Kimberly left the company in 2017.</p>
<p>Mary described how open communication between the two has included honest feedback and heart-to-heart discussions. She also said that her mentor’s guidance was “instrumental” when she decided to make the move from treasury to accounting last year, in a role which involves managing her own team. “Kimberly may not have realised how valuable her advice has been to me,” Mary said. “It’s been very poignant in every decision I’ve made as a manager.”</p>

<p>The two women also offered plenty of valuable advice about how to initiate and develop a successful mentoring relationship, underlining the importance of having each other’s best interests at heart – and how this leads to some tough conversations. As Kimberly said, “If I don’t talk to her about something that I see is creating a roadblock for her, I’m not giving her the value that I should as a mentor. So we do have those conversations, but we have them in a caring and respectful way.”</p>
<p>Next came a presentation of the findings of the 2018 Women in Treasury Global Study by Sophie Jackson, Treasury Today’s Joint Publisher &amp; Head of Strategic Content. On a positive note, 76% of respondents said that their companies now have a strategy for diversity and inclusion – but more concerningly, 39% felt they were not paid the same as their male counterparts. Continuing the focus on mentoring, Sophie said that 79% of the survey’s respondents saw mentoring, sponsorship and coaching as critical for career development.</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury Chicago Roundtable 2019" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/roundtables-2019/2019-06-06-tt-00-wit__chicago__073__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=B64C6CDD6852E8174608A3117E64F6C1" style="float:right;margin:0 0 2em 2em;"/>
<p>The discussion sparked some interesting insights from attendees. Several women commented that while they had never had a female manager themselves, the picture has evolved in recent years as more female treasury professionals had come up through the ranks. Many spoke of the need to provide strong female role models for their daughters. Attendees also talked about the importance of both diversity and inclusion, with one noting that “diversity without inclusion doesn’t really go anywhere”.</p>
<p>The discussion turned to the importance of flexible working arrangements, with some participants sharing strategies that had proved effective for their organisations. One company had created a rota system allowing all staff to work remotely one day a week, while maintaining coverage in the office. Attendees talked about the importance of offering flexibility equally, regardless of people’s circumstances. They also noted the additional technology resources that may be needed to facilitate people in working from home.</p>
<p>Finally, Christine spoke compellingly about the power of change and making change, noting that “we all have a voice within our organisation.” Participants were then invited to share what they had taken away from the event and how they might implement changes, either in their organisations or in themselves. Their answers revealed a range of energising action points, from formalising mentoring relationships to leading by example with the adoption of flexible working.</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p>In Treasury Today’s 2018 Women in Treasury Annual Global Study 39% of our respondents did not feel they were paid the same as their male counterparts.</p>
<p>We can’t change parity at a corporate level overnight, but we can help equip you with the best tools to get what you deserve at work right now. So, in the first of our How to videos we present ‘How to Negotiate a Pay Rise’.</p>
<p>We asked Louise Watts, Director of Transition Hub, for her guidance on the matter.</p>
<p>“There are a number of things to consider when preparing to negotiate a pay rise. It’s important to do your research and know your situation.</p>
<p>Does your organisation reward the person, the role or the project? If your organisation rewards the person then think about timing and readiness for the conversation. Know your value, with evidence of your achievements, your impact and a view of what you are capable. There will be a time of year when remuneration is assessed so it’s important to start the negotiation well before that time, suggesting this being the start of the conversation.</p>
<p>If your organisation rewards the role, then your negotiation should focus on your readiness for the next role and the timing you want to work towards. This conversation becomes more about gaining sponsorship for a promotion into a role that comes with more dollars.</p>
<p>Should your organisation reward the project, it’s important set clear milestones and achievements with performance rewards, prior to commencing the project.</p>
<p>In every situation, communication is key, using directive, not passive language. Be prepared, professional, calm and confident, making sure you set up a formal meeting, rather than relying on a drop-in chat.”</p>

<div class="copy__body"><h4>What attracted you to a career in treasury and how would you describe your experience to date?</h4>
<p>As is the case with so many of my contemporaries, I almost fell into treasury. In saying this I mean I realised in hindsight all of my prior ‘accounting’ roles were actually treasury related. Initial encouragement came from being able to work on high profile and complex projects with early career access to the CFO. As the years progressed I was promoted and have since gained depth and breadth across a variety of industries, organisations and even countries. I have found the diversity of work challenging but also very rewarding.</p>
<h4>How would you assess the opportunities for progression at PageGroup?</h4>
<p>PageGroup is a people business which invests heavily in its employees and takes succession planning and career aspirations very seriously. Employees are actively encouraged to seek new opportunities to diversify their skillset and should you want the opportunity to move within the group, roles overseas are available. Personally I have been able to take on a number of new challenges, such as taking on the global insurance programme in 2018.</p>
<h4>What is the best piece of advice that you have been given so far along your own special journey?</h4>
<p>I would say it has to be to remember everyone starts at the beginning and never be afraid to ask questions along the way.</p>
<h4>Looking back, is there anything that you would have done differently in your career path?</h4>
<p>Looking back, I would not do anything differently. I believe everything is done for a reason and even in the most challenging of circumstances I look for the positives and feel there is always room for personal growth.</p>
<h4>What advice would you give to women in trying to develop their careers in treasury?</h4>
<p>My advice would be the same for either gender. I would say it is vitally important to be yourself, no matter who you are and to always put your best foot forward; as only then will you be happy and realise your full potential. If you feel you are struggling, always seek help, whether it is from your supervisor or the group treasurer or even seek the help of a mentor. There are a lot of fantastic mentors out there to help people through those early years.</p>
<h4>What has been the most important guiding principle during your career?</h4>
<p>My guiding principle is to be genuinely passionate about what you do because if you are passionate, everything else including success will fall into place.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><h4 id="multiple-challenges-from-within-and-without">Multiple challenges from within and without</h4>
<p>Joanna believes the biggest near-term challenge, not just for her but all treasurers generally, is the unprecedented volume of information needing to be tracked and processed: “Political turmoil, the plethora of new regulation… and then the fintech providers that are challenging traditional banks. As treasurers, we need to assimilate and analyse all this information, assess the opportunities or threats it presents for our respective companies and wider industries. A huge amount of personal investment and skill are required to achieve that.”</p>
<p>Treasurers today have to show very high levels of agility and flexibility, yet remain grounded and methodical: “It is certainly a very challenging skillset but it helps ensure we have the right ability and skills as treasurers, to face the challenges presented by exponential growth in information and data, and the arrival of the age of automation. There is going to be a big change, and I think it will be a very fast change, however, we must embrace it, keep up with it, while at the same time driving our companies and industries forward.”</p>
<p>The complex and demanding responsibility treasurers have in keeping abreast of such external developments whilst at the same time ensuring their departments remain fit for purpose operationally, is certainly in evidence at PageGroup, where Joanna’s team recently delivered on a large scale group-wide transformation project. In the space of just 12 months the team transitioned or replaced transactional bankers in 94 subsidiaries and established cash pooling and automated the banking interfaces with the group’s new global ERP.</p>
<p>It was “a mammoth undertaking” for Joanna’s small team but already she and her colleagues are focused on delivering the second phase of the project. Over the next 12 months the team intends to take a deep dive into the group’s working capital and debt facilities, investment portfolios and global credit card programmes.</p>
<p>“We may be a small team but we are challenging the status quo, which I think is really interesting and certainly keeps us all on our toes. We want to ensure that treasury is fit for purpose and in so doing support the wider business in a fast-evolving environment.”</p>
<p>Joanna says the size of her department means each of the individuals within the team is being given the unique opportunity to develop new skills: “I believe that being able to offer personal growth is vitally important for treasury team members. We get to deliver the new products but we also get to develop our individual skills, and generally enjoy a greater sense of fulfilment. It allows us to embrace innovation, in doing so creating opportunities which benefit us as individuals as well as the organisation.”</p>
<h4 id="sage-advice-for-treasury-newcomers">Sage advice for treasury newcomers</h4>
<p>For every young person, embarking on a career is a daunting process, especially in treasury where for juniors the required knowledge and the skill set will appear insurmountable. To best navigate their early career in treasury, I would certainly recommend they look to secure professional qualifications such as the Diploma of Treasury Management offered by the Association of Corporate Treasurers. The qualification provides a solid foundation for anyone entering this industry.</p>
<p>Membership to professional bodies or other industry groups provides additional benefits such as access to career development tools, career hubs, networking opportunities and mentoring. Combining professional qualifications with on the job experience is critical to gaining confidence and making progress.</p>
<p>Joanna further believes it is important for those starting their journey in treasury to appreciate just how diverse the profession’s skill set has become and the demands which will be made of them going forward. “We are no longer operating in our ivory tower as was the case ten years ago. We do now have a seat at the table, we act as advisors to the CEO, the CFO, and the business alike. We move interchangeably between talking to say the board, our banking partners, the commercial teams, and shared service centres within our organisations.</p>
<p>“To be effective in this job, one must evolve beyond the treasury function and really become a trusted advisor, almost with a masters in stakeholder management. Put simply, we must be prepared for the foul weather as well as the fair.”</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p><em>Record numbers of treasury and finance professionals from across the region come together in Singapore to celebrate and champion women in treasury.</em></p>
<p>On Thursday 11<sup>th</sup> April over 130 senior treasury professionals from throughout Asia Pacific gathered at the Four Seasons hotel in Singapore to celebrate diversity at Treasury Today Group’s sixth  Women in Treasury Singapore Forum.</p>
<p>A diverse line up of senior industry speakers shared their experiences and insights on a broad range of issues affecting many women and men working in treasury across the region, whilst also offering some valuable advice to the audience. The 2019 Singapore panellists were:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Catherine Yu</strong>, VP Regional Controller, Herbalife Nutrition</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lay Perk Toh</strong>, Corporate Treasurer, Kulicke and Soffa</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Yeng Butler</strong>, Senior Managing Director and Global Head of Cash Business, State Street Global Advisors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jason Horn</strong>, Head of the Asia Pacific Cash &amp; Short Duration Liquidity Business, BlackRock</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At the lively pre-lunch reception, the forum was opened by Sophie Jackson, Joint Publisher &amp; Head of Strategic Content who introduced the Women in Treasury initiative and Meg Coates, Joint Publisher &amp; Head of Operations who then presented some of the key findings of Treasury Today Group’s most recent Women in Treasury Annual Global Study, proudly supported by State Street Global Advisors.  A three course lunch in the Crescent Ballroom was the setting for the vibrant and insightful panel discussion, facilitated by Sophie Jackson.  The inspiring debate included topics such as mentoring, nurturing talent, flexibility and  overcoming personal challenges.</p>
<p>Following the panel discussion, an enthusiastic question and answer session took place, with many questions raised by members of the audience who took the opportunity to share their own views and experiences. This enabled the panel to share further insights from their own careers and the challenges they have faced and overcome.</p>
<p>Speaking about the success of this year’s Singapore Forum, Sophie Jackson said, “It’s never felt more important to be here today to celebrate women in our industry. I’ve been delighted to see the fantastic representation for women there is here in Singapore at senior levels in corporate treasury and finance and the support from our community here for the Women in Treasury initiative since the beginning really has been overwhelming!”</p>

<p>March 8<sup>th</sup> is a special date in the calendar. Not only is it International Women’s Day – it is also the anniversary of the unveiling of the iconic Fearless Girl sculpture by Kristen Visbal, commissioned by State Street Global Advisors, which was recently installed in her new home outside the New York Stock Exchange. This year, March 8th also saw Treasury Today and State Street Global Advisors return to Convene above New York’s Times Square for their latest Women in Treasury event – exactly one year after their first joint roundtable in the same location.</p>
<p>Introducing the event, Yeng Butler, Senior Managing Director and Global Head of Cash Business of State Street Global Advisors, explained how a desire to be more data-driven about the core issues affecting women professionals had led to State Street Global Advisors partnering with Treasury Today to support their annual Women in Treasury Global Study. “Our goal this year is to define the way forward,” she added, explaining that a new format would include implementable guidance that attendees could put into practice.</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury New York Roundtable 2019" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/roundtables-2019/2019-03-19-tt-00-wit__witssga_3_8_2019-29__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=D5FA83E454E9EDC27C74DCC7FED3056C" style="float:right;margin:0 0 2em 2em;"/>
<p>Yeng was joined by Pia McCusker, Senior Managing Director and Global Head of Cash Management and Dominica Ribeiro, Head of Institutional Marketing, North America, for a discussion focusing on corporate culture and why it matters. Pia shared her experiences since being asked to lead State Street Global Advisors’ portfolio management team, explaining how she had implemented major changes to achieve a more diverse team, with colleagues responding enthusiastically to the new working environment.</p>
<p>There was also an insightful debate about the challenges that can arise when attempting to “retrofit” the ideal corporate culture into an already established group of people, as well as the importance of corporate culture when it comes to attracting and retaining talent.</p>
<p>Next up was an exclusive coaching workshop led by Louise Watts, Director of HPC Global and Founder of Transition Hub. Concentrating on the topic of ‘executive presence’, Louise encouraged guests to consider how they are perceived today, how they would like to be perceived by others and how they could achieve that change.</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury New York Roundtable 2019" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/roundtables-2019/2019-03-19-tt-00-wit__witssga_3_8_2019-20__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=96145419382EFA38BBA33CCAE5FA4B02" style="float:left;margin:0 2em 2em 0;"/>
<p>Explaining that first impressions are established within ten seconds of appearing in front of a person or a group, Louise provided invaluable practical direction, guiding participants through exercises such as achieving a powerful stance, carrying yourself with confidence and having control over how others perceive you. The workshop, which was enthusiastically received by all, concluded with a powerful message: “Grant yourself permission to be the person you want to be.”</p>
<p>The final session saw Sophie Jackson, Treasury Today’s Joint Publisher &amp; Head of Strategic Content, presenting some key insights from the 2018 Women in Treasury Global Study, while inviting some lively discussions amongst the guest treasurers and other finance professionals. Attendees shared their thoughts about the importance of gender equality, with many expressing the wish to effect positive change for the benefit of their children. Attention was also paid to the importance of diversity and inclusion, with guests noting that different experiences and different ways of thinking can make teams stronger – but that companies also need a culture that allows diverse people to feel part of the organisation.</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury New York Roundtable 2019" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/roundtables-2019/2019-03-19-tt-00-wit__witssga_3_8_2019-33__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=3A5013112B6E4A93785C326590692606" style="float:right;margin:0 0 2em 2em;"/>
<p>The topic of parental leave likewise sparked some interesting discussion among guests. While 30% of the 2018 Women in Treasury Global Study’s respondents had noticed significant numbers of men taking up the option of parental leave, 41% said this was only accessed by a minority – and 29% hadn’t noticed any men taking up the opportunity. Participants discussed why encouraging men to take parental leave was an important element of furthering gender equality, while noting possible obstacles, such as perceived stigma and the impact on discretionary bonuses.</p>
<p>Turning to female representation at different levels, Sophie noted that while most respondents worked in teams that were more than 30% female, only 24% had a female CFO – and a mere 5% had a female CEO. This corresponded with the proportion of female CEOs on the Fortune 500, which fell below 25 in 2018. Sophie commented that since Treasury Today’s first Women in Treasury Global Study six years ago, the idea of quotas for female representation on boards had overtaken opposition, with 44% now supporting the idea.</p>
<p>Finally, guests were invited to pose for a photo with one of the original renderings of the Fearless Girl statue – marking the end of a thought-provoking and dynamic event. Guests departed with plenty of inspiration and action points to take back to their own organisations.</p>

<p>The unveiling of the Fearless Girl statue in December 2018, preceded the latest Women in Treasury roundtable, hosted by Treasury Today and State Street Global Advisors. The opportunity for guest treasurers and other finance professionals to discuss the relevance of the statue in the context of the findings of the Women in Treasury Global Study provided much material for debate.</p>
<p>“As we head into 2019, our goal is quite simple: to make it the year of taking insight into action,” Yeng Butler, Senior Managing Director and Global Head of Cash Business, State Street Global Advisors, told roundtable guests seated in Siebert Hall – named after Muriel Siebert, the first woman to own a seat on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Guest speaker India Gary-Martin, Leadership for Executives, spoke of the elusive ‘executive presence’ in the workplace and the manner in which it is closely tied to “how people perceive you – their perception of who you are as opposed to who you actually are”.</p>
<p>The Fearless Girl statue may embody positivity and strength, but many women still struggle to obtain executive presence in their career, she argues. “It doesn't matter what level of seniority you have, environmental conditions mean that women are often still challenged by that.”</p>
<h4 id="far-to-go">Far to go</h4>
<img alt="Women in Treasury New York Roundtable 2018" height="225" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/roundtables-2019/2019-03-04-tt-00-wit__m6a1591__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=978D1537EC3903CB02B82BE8F0A49825" style="float:right;margin:0 0 2em 2em;" width="200"/>
<p>Despite a global push for gender equality in recent years, data shows the battle is far from over. Only 5% of female treasurers have a female CEO and 82% lack a diverse board leading their company, Treasury Today’s latest Women in Treasury Global Study reveals.</p>
<p>The annual report, supported by State Street Global Advisors, found that most respondents work in teams where more than 30% are female. However, at the top of their organisations, the view changes fairly dramatically.</p>
<p>Only 5% of respondents have a female CEO and 82% lack a diverse board, the survey found, with over 348 responses worldwide.</p>
<h4 id="key-to-success">Key to success</h4>
<img alt="Women in Treasury New York Roundtable 2018" height="225" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/roundtables-2019/2019-03-04-tt-00-wit__m6a1594__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=42C57A00C5FAEAEC56B0A992390B6CDB" style="float:right;margin:0 0 2em 2em;" width="200"/>
<p>Mentoring, sponsorship and coaching programmes continue to receive positive response, with over 79% saying these were key to career success. While the line between a mentor and sponsor is thin, treasurers agreed that a sponsor speaks on your behalf in senior management situations, whereas a mentor is someone you can go to for advice. Establishing a mentorship or sponsorship relationship must be done organically, argued one female US-based treasurer. “You can't force people to be your mentor or sponsor. To get a good mentor, you need to put yourself out there,” she explained.</p>
<p>However, not everyone in the room agreed. One treasurer previously worked for a bank where there was a more compulsory mentorship programme. “I was junior, and a managing director was my mentor. I think it was really good to ask managing directors to help young people who are starting their careers,” she said. “I learnt a lot, but my mentor learnt from his interactions with me. Companies can force it and mentors will see the benefits afterwards,” she added.</p>
<h4 id="renewed-support-for-quotas">Renewed support for quotas</h4>
<p>A 2018 McKinsey report, ‘Women in the Workplace’, cited by one speaker, reports that hindrances to women reaching the top start long before they take time out to raise a family. “It’s actually at women’s first chance of promotion that men are promoted, and women are not,” commented the speaker.</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury New York Roundtable 2018" height="225" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/roundtables-2019/2019-03-04-tt-00-wit__m6a1603__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=937189E3C5E249E437B5D294301D24B9" style="float:left;margin:0 2em 2em 0;" width="200"/>
<p>For the first time since the Women in Treasury Global Study was launched in 2013, support for quotas on boards has overtaken opposition by more than 10%. In fact, 44% felt there should be a quota for women on boards, 32% were opposed and 24% were unsure.</p>
<p>Some treasurers at the roundtable argued that quotas give female leadership a necessary push, whereas others argued that they do not “win people’s hearts and minds”. This new support for quotas may be connected to a feeling that more should be done to support women at work.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Yeng’s call to make 2019 a year of turning “insight into action” perhaps should become an industry-wide mantra.</p></div>

<p><em>State Street Global Advisors and Treasury Today Group’s Women in Treasury roundtables came to Singapore in November 2018 to unveil the results of the Women in Treasury Global Study 2018 with the local corporate community. Guests also discussed how to curate an ‘executive presence’ and refine their personal brand.</em></p>

<p>Over a third (39%) of female treasurers feel they earn less than their male counterparts, the 2018 Women in Treasury Annual Global Study revealed. Additionally, over a quarter of respondents believe they have been overlooked or ignored in the workplace because of their gender. The eye-opening results of Treasury Today’s study, supported by State Street Global Advisors, was the topic of discussion for the audience in Singapore on November 20<sup>th</sup> 2018.</p>
<p>This event was the latest in a series of roundtables, hosted by Treasury Today and State Street Global Advisors, looking at women in treasury. Conducted from May to September 2018, the study attracted 348 responses with those participating ranging widely in age, experience, geography and role. Of these, only 5% of female treasurers surveyed felt there have been improvements in pay parity over the past year. However, most respondents characterised their company’s approach to diversity, inclusion and equal opportunity as ‘favourable’.</p>

<p>Following an enjoyable lunch with treasury guests from a broad spectrum of industries, Gunjan Chauhan, Head of EMEA Cash Business at State Street Global Advisors, set the tone for the roundtable discussion.</p>
<p>“What surprises me is that, even in 2018, we’re having the same conversations that we were having decades before, back in 2008 or even 1998, around gender equality in the workplace,” she said. “It perplexes me why we still keep having the same conversation, why we aren’t moving forward at the pace that I’m sure most of us around this table would want to move,” Chauhan commented.</p>
<p>This view was supported in the annual study. The majority of respondents work in teams where more than 30% are female. However, at the top of their organisations this changes dramatically: only 5% of respondents have a female CEO and 82% said their company does not have a diverse board. Mentoring sponsorship and coaching programmes continued to receive positive responses, with 79% of all respondents believing these were key to a successful career.</p>
<h4 id="do-you-have-executive-presence">Do you have executive presence?</h4>
<img alt="Women in Treasury Singapore Rountable 2018" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/roundtables-2019/2019__01-02__tta__03__wit__dscf4536__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=AD0691ACEAF83F494917C604B9DD5367" style="float:right;margin:0 0 2em 2em;"/>
<p>As such, Louise Watts, founder of Australian executive coaching company, Transition Hub, spoke to the roundtable guests about how she mentors women (and men), in the importance of ‘executive presence’ and how it can be gained.</p>
<p>Executive presence has often been cited across recruitment teams and board rooms as a qualifying characteristic for senior roles in the corporate world. As jobs increasingly become automated, both men and women are going to need this type of human skill more than they ever have in the past, Watts explained. “It’s not something that naturally arrives as you grow up. As women, I think it’s a really untapped opportunity for us to be more confident, bolder and more present in our organisations,” outlined Watts.</p>
<p>Having worked with business women globally, Watts argues that a lack of confidence plays havoc with female careers worldwide. “Networking, being confident and present is not something we naturally grant ourselves the right to,” she explained. “Interestingly, we are probably more likely to get the job done, take care of the details and ensure somebody else can look good as they network, than do it ourselves,” Watts pointed out.</p>
<h4 id="curating-a-personal-brand">Curating a personal brand</h4>
<img alt="Women in Treasury Singapore Rountable 2018" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/roundtables-2019/2019__01-02__tta__03__wit__dscf4500__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=E08062022978574E4FAB4C52900086AB" style="float:right;margin:0 0 2em 2em;"/>
<p>When working with clients, Watts often asks them to imagine how people would describe them in a couple of words. They are then asked to think about how they would like to be described, and “so often there’s a little gap,” Watts said. She then works to close that gap to create their desired perception.</p>
<p>“We pretty much know the strategies. It’s reminding ourselves to coach ourselves or to take advantage of feedback we’ve been given through coaching or from peers,” Watts explained.</p>
<p>People are often so busy with work and other things in their lives, that they’re not thinking about their personal brand, Watts said. “But I think we’re beginning to. We’re reading more on social media, listening to podcasts and going to events where we’re reminded that we can build our own reputation,” Watts explained. “It’s all about choice rather than just accepting the way someone sees you,” she added.</p>
<p>After enthusiastic discussion from male and female treasurers sharing stories of progress and remaining barriers, Chauhan rallied the audience. “There are enough of us now – very like-minded colleagues, male and female – who can come together and make it count. But if we don’t make it count, if we don’t challenge the status quo or the corporate policies then what’s the point? It will always be the same. “Now more than ever, I’m feeling like people are ready to think differently,” she concluded.</p>

<p><em>On 25th September 2018, on the eve of EuroFinance International Conference in Geneva, Treasury Today and State Street Global Advisors brought their eponymous roundtable discussion group on tour to Switzerland for a very special and intimate evening with a select group of corporates. Guests were gathered together within the beautiful surrounds of the Hotel du Beau Rivage, to discuss why diversity and inclusion in treasury is important to them. Attendees of the soirée came together to network and were amongst the first people globally to hear the latest analysis and takeaways from the Women in Treasury Annual Global Study 2018 proudly supported by State Street Global Advisors.</em></p>

<p>The data from the Women in Treasury Annual Global Study 2018 had been so freshly written up that the report was not yet printed, so this group was lucky enough to exclusively hear the result highlights and to share what the findings mean to them in real terms as treasury professionals.</p>
<p>Gunjan Chauhan, Head of APAC and EMEA Cash Business at State Street Global Advisors, opened the evening, welcoming everyone and briefly outlining the reasons behind State Street Global Advisors’ commitment to gender equality, diversity and inclusion, epitomised by the Fearless Girl. Attendees watched a brief video showcasing the unveiling of Fearless Girl and the fantastic work that State Street Global Advisors has been doing to lobby companies to increase their gender representation at board level. It was fantastic to bring the Fearless Girl and her story to Switzerland for the evening and to spread the message of power and progress that she represents.</p>

After introducing himself, Will stressed the importance of the global dialogue around diversity and inclusion as critical in understanding the barriers that remain and measures needed to effect change. It was then over to Meg Coates, Joint Publisher &amp; Head of Operations at the Treasury Today Group, to present a summary of the main takeaways from the Women in Treasury Annual Global Study 2018 results.</p>
<p>To bring insights from the experiences and opinions of a seasoned corporate treasury professional, Séverine Le Blévennec, Director of Treasury EMEA at Honeywell, was the expert guest speaker for the evening and was interviewed in a scintillating fireside chat by Sophie Jackson, Joint Publisher &amp; Head of Strategic Content at the Treasury Today Group. Séverine’s experiences over the course of her successful career were invaluable and she drew on her own personal insights in a frank and open conversation.</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury Geneva Roundtable" height="225" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/roundtables-2019/2019__01-02__tt__06__wit__img_1743__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=204F851FA9EBAC211918A5E65A12D016" style="float:left;margin:0 2em 2em 0;" width="200"/>
<p>Amongst the wide ranging topics for discussion were some of the key highlights from the 2018 Study results. One of the areas that was assessed by our guests was this year’s respondents’ thoughts on the topic of mentoring, sponsorship and coaching. As with previous years’ responses, there was overwhelming support for these activities, with 79% of our respondents believing they were key to career advancement. Séverine shared her personal experiences of two particularly stand-out managers over the course of her career encouraging her along the way. Her current boss, Marie-Astrid Dubois of Honeywell, had been a particularly strong influence in Séverine’s decision to move to Honeywell and the support and inspiration that her boss had offered her rang true amongst our guests.</p>
<p>Beyond individuals, there was also talk of how learning and defining our roles for ourselves as we shift our focus and seek to grow, can be critical in career progression. Séverine’s appetite for learning and for thinking outside of the box when assessing where she might seek to augment her knowledge base has certainly made her a sought-after asset in the companies she has worked for.</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury Geneva Roundtable" height="225" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/roundtables-2019/2019__01-02__tt__06__wit__img_1749__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=C3370E4E7287D414F1BEB05E6CB2FC8E" style="float:right;margin:0 0 2em 2em;" width="200"/>
<p>Mobility and moving location as an efficient way to boost a career was also mentioned by many of the Women in Treasury Annual Global Study respondents. Although Séverine had been offered a strategic move to Detroit as part of a previous role, she shared her experiences in declining such opportunities. There is a lot more to consider than our own career advancement when planning a big move, particularly for those professionals with families and other responsibilities. Her prudent approach offered a balance to the usual rhetoric around ‘feeling the fear and doing it anyway’ and a more risk-taking attitude towards one’s professional development.</p>
<p>On a more practical and implementable level, our participants discussed statistics around parity, including the disheartening fact that 39% of our 2018 respondents felt that they were not paid the same as their male counterparts at the same level of seniority. Attendees shared their own experiences of negotiating their salaries and pushing for promotions and pay rises. It was encouraging to see a collective support emerge around the topic of negotiating within our attendees’ organisations as we moved from this disappointing piece of data to more galvanising action for us all.</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p><em>On 10<sup>th</sup> October over 150 attendees from the worlds of corporate finance, technology and banking came together to celebrate women in treasury at the third annual Women in Treasury New York Forum.</em></p>
<p>Over 150 women and men from the world of finance gathered at the Pierre hotel in Midtown Manhattan on 10th October for the third Women in Treasury New York Forum. The event saw professionals arrive from the East and West Coasts of the US to celebrate women in corporate treasury and the allies who support progress in our industry.</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury New York Forum 2018" height="225" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/new-york-2018/2019__01-02__tt__03__wit__2018-wit-nyk-389__200x225.jpg?h=225&amp;w=200&amp;la=en&amp;hash=7BEAE36CDDCD06392F5B7DAE5845364F" style="height: 225px; width: 200px;float:left;margin:0 2em 2em 0;" width="200">
<p>The Forum is going from strength to strength every year. Not only is it a fantastic and rare opportunity to bring together likeminded professionals to meet their peers and share their views and experiences; it also enables them to assess data from the latest Women in Treasury Global Study in partnership with State Street Global Advisors and hear from our fabulous panellists who this year were: Debbie Kaya, Senior Director, Treasury, Global Cash and Operations, Cisco; Nancy Pierce, Managing Director, Global Head of Payment Programs, Global Liquidity and Cash Management, HSBC; Christy Barwick, Treasurer, Core Scientific; and Pia McCusker, Senior Managing Director and Global Head of Cash Management, State Street Global Advisors.</p>
<p>The day began with a networking drinks reception during which Treasury Today Group’s Sophie Jackson, Joint Publisher &amp; Head of Strategic Content, and Meg Coates, Joint Publisher &amp; Head of Operations, talked briefly about what inspired them to launch the Women in Treasury initiative before providing a summary of the latest annual global study results. Guests then moved through to the lavish ballroom of The Pierre, built in the 1930s and a landmark on Fifth Avenue, for a seated lunch. After the main course, the panellists took to the stage for a discussion moderated by Sophie.</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury New York Forum 2018" height="225" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/new-york-2018/2019__01-02__tt__03__wit__2018-wit-nyk-137__200x225.jpg?h=225&amp;w=200&amp;la=en&amp;hash=0DCE1E06777B1AF7F2FC259B65B55DF8" style="height: 225px; width: 200px;float:right;margin:0 0 2em 2em;" width="200"/>
<p>Christy spoke about her path to treasury, recalling: “My treasury career began at an early age when I was elected as treasurer of my elementary school!” Christy has enjoyed a varied and exciting career, having initially held corporate treasury and finance positions at Daimler Trucks and PACCAR before moving on to Microsoft where she worked in treasury capital management – corporate finance under the leadership of her professional mentor, Anita Mehra. In 2011 she became the first treasurer of the largest invention capital company, Intellectual Ventures, founded by former CTO of Microsoft, Nathan Myhrvold. After spending nearly seven years at Intellectual Ventures, Christy was approached by Kevin Turner, former Microsoft COO and the current CEO of blockchain and AI start-up Core Scientific, to become Core’s first treasurer.</p>
<p>Pia spoke of the fabulous mentors who have helped her throughout her career, notably people who provided support and training when she started her career at Fleet Bank. A stint at a start-up followed but it was short-lived as the company sadly closed. Pia returned to graduate school and, armed with a degree, went to State Street Global Advisors where she has been for 18 years. She is full of praise for her manager, Matthew Steinaway, Chief Investment Officer of Fixed Income, Cash and Currency,: “He is a leader I have followed and been supported by the whole way. We have worked together for 13 years. He is a leader who allows talent to thrive and has no bias or prejudice.”</p></img></div>

<p>Debbie spoke of her career journey, beginning with her desire to become a doctor. She recalled graduating in the early 90s when there was a big downturn and a challenging jobs market. Debbie was initially cajoled into her role in treasury at Cisco by her manager – something she is now grateful for, as it has led to a rewarding career. She describes her career path as “one that has been defined by taking chances and moving to take on roles that I had never done before and by leadership that believed in me”.</p>
<p>Nancy has been based in New York for the majority of her career but her postings have included Hong Kong (with Chase Manhattan) and London (with HSBC). Her career has been defined by making decisions, such as changing company or location, based very much on what would work for everyone at home at a given point in time. “The challenge for me has been to understand and recognise when the time is right to make a major decision like relocating or changing company,” she says.</p>
<p>Christy followed up on Debbie’s comments by talking about the importance of “knowing when the time is right to move on”. These moments allow us to refresh and ‘to tap into our network’ she says, pointing to her own decision, after leaving Intellectual Ventures, to take some time out, meet lots of different, interesting people across her network, and generally recharge. Understanding what is most important at various stages of one’s career and being strategic in identifying and filling gaps in your professional portfolio is critical, she says.</p>
<h4 id="boardroom-quotas">Boardroom quotas</h4>
<p>The evolution of female representation in the financial industry was the next focus of discussion, with Debbie relating how, from her college days through to working in capital markets and European cash management, she saw changes in that representation. Working in predominantly male environments early in her career and then, later in Amsterdam, in a largely female environment, led Debbie to understand the importance of real diversity in representation, one that is not just limited to gender. The tokenism that she had encountered many years ago appears to have abated, Debbie feels, and she has begun to observe women truly moving up the ranks in the industry.</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury New York Forum 2018" height="225" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/new-york-2018/2019__01-02__tt__03__wit__2018-wit-nyk-197__200x225.jpg?h=225&amp;w=200&amp;la=en&amp;hash=CE078923441A276F6FA9E30C64622C0C" style="height: 225px; width: 200px;float:right;margin:0 0 2em 2em;" width="200"/>
<p>A debate about how best to encourage a culture of inclusion and what is meant when we speak of an inclusive environment followed. For Nancy an inclusive environment is one where everyone is welcome and where there is true representation, creating a perfect “recipe for businesses to do well”. While she has observed women coming up the ranks, she believes there is still a long way to go. Leaders are now under growing pressure to reach down and to pull up rising talent and that needs to be encouraged, even if it requires the use of quotas, she believes.</p>
<p>A live poll of the forum participants to gauge their support for the use of quotas for board representation revealed that roughly 70% of those present were in favour – far greater than the 44% of the Women in Treasury Annual Global Study 2018 respondents who also support quotas.</p>
<p>Pia then highlighted the importance of diversity of thought and getting different people, with different viewpoints, together in a room. In her current role, Pia has worked hard to bring some interesting new hires into her team and to really make sure that diverse opinions and backgrounds are represented.</p>
<p>Mentoring is being seen as an increasingly vital tool in the corporate workplace. Christy shared her experience about the benefits she herself has derived from acting as a mentor and how honoured she felt to have such a role. For many years she was a leader in Intellectual Venture’s Senior Women’s Mentoring Circle, comprising a diverse group of senior women who came together to help support each other to achieve their personal and professional goals. Nancy expanded on the theme by detailing how mentoring, sponsorship and coaching can come into play at various key moments during one’s career.</p>
<h4 id="question-of-balance">Question of balance</h4>
<img alt="Women in Treasury New York Forum 2018" height="225" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/new-york-2018/2019__01-02__tt__03__wit__2018-wit-nyk-102__200x225.jpg?h=225&amp;w=200&amp;la=en&amp;hash=991E7E2E3DB7F13DFE220E68D771E9BC" style="height: 225px; width: 200px;float:left;margin:0 2em 2em 0;" width="200"/>
<p>It is more important than ever in today’s fast-moving world to manage not just our careers but also our own personal development, ensuring a balance. Pia explained that the domestic set-up that has allowed her to be at her best professionally is to have a stay-at-home husband. She emphasised the importance of extracurricular activities for ensuring the pressures of work do not overwhelm. She is also a champion of parental leave and has worked to ensure that the people who work for her, both men and women, take up their entitlement in full.</p>
<p>Parity continues to be an issue to the respondents of the Women in Treasury Annual Global Study, with 39% of the 2018 respondents feeling they were not being paid the same as their male counterparts. Nancy was asked to share some implementable advice on negotiating, as this should be at least one route women can take to be paid what they are worth. She suggested those with a grievance over pay should do some research through various means to determine industry benchmarks and company expectations, followed by some tough but fact-based conversations with their managers about what they think they are actually worth. Christy amplified Nancy’s comments by sharing her own approach when negotiating. When asked what her own salary requirements were, she replied, “more is better!” A lesson for us all.</p>
<h4 id="inspirational-journeys">Inspirational journeys</h4>
<img alt="Women in Treasury New York Forum 2018" height="225" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/new-york-2018/2019__01-02__tt__03__wit__2018-wit-nyk-398__200x225.jpg?h=225&amp;w=200&amp;la=en&amp;hash=FB45241D19B6AA30F5B8123503FBBE19" style="height: 225px; width: 200px;float:right;margin:0 0 2em 2em;" width="200"/>
<p>Outside of our professional communities is a wider community that we all belong to. The Women in Treasury initiative strongly supports and encourages all professionals from the industry to think about the ways in which they can be part of a broader community movement which helps everyone to thrive. Christy shared her experiences of serving on the board of FIRST Washington, a STEM and mentor-based organisation, and of the importance of finding opportunities to contribute and give back to our communities.</p>
<p>Pia’s final piece of advice was to be “real and authentic”, noting her own experience of being honest and human in front of her team at critical moments and seeing how powerful that can be.</p>
<p>The event ended on an emotive note, as the panellists spoke of the special and unique individuals who had most inspired them in their own journeys to where they are today. They included the story of one woman who went from segregated schooling to M.I.T and then to running a large corporation. What was noticeable in all four individuals who were highlighted as an inspiration by our panellists was their human traits of authenticity, kindness, determination and respect. What never fails to surprise at our discussions on career development is how important it is to be ourselves and to cultivate the best version of that as we advance up the ladder.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p><em>On 13<sup>th</sup> September in London, record numbers of attendees from the worlds of corporate finance, technology and banking came together to celebrate women in treasury at the sixth annual Women in Treasury London Forum.</em></p>
<p>Plaisterers’ Hall in the City of London was host to the gathering as we came together to discuss the latest results of the eagerly anticipated Women in Treasury Annual Global Study proudly supported by State Street Global Advisors and to discuss, in real terms, the experiences of women in the treasury profession.</p>
<p>Over the six years that the Treasury Today Group has been running the Women in Treasury initiative, it has been astonishing to see how conversations around diversity have evolved. In a relatively short time, gender equality, diversity and inclusion have shifted from fringe topics to terms that are at the heart of daily corporate life.</p>
<p>What is equally important is that the focus of these conversations has also shifted beyond the topic of gender diversity to focus on a much broader range of issues. These conversations are helping to create a more holistic view of what it means to have a diverse corporate culture.</p>
<figure class="portrait right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0em 0em 2em;"><img alt="WIT London Man speaking" height="225" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/london-2018/2018-11and12-tt-04-wit__man-speaking__ldn-wit-345__200x225.jpg?h=225&amp;w=200&amp;la=en&amp;hash=1102B4DA70CD2741DD8396E44F9B5B77" style="height: 225px; width: 200px;" width="200"><br/>
</img></figure>
<p>There are many drivers behind this evolution, perhaps most crucial is the correlation between diversity and improved business performance. As if further evidence was required, a recent 2018 <a href="https://www.bcg.com/en-us/publications/2018/how-diverse-leadership-teams-boost-innovation.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Boston Consulting Group Study</a> cites diversity in corporations as driving innovation and, critically, financial performance.</p>
<h3 id="diversity-in-action">Diversity in action</h3>
<p>The journey to equality is not all about numbers and hitting targets. Diversity is the by-product of an inclusive workplace, diversity is what you have and inclusion is how you act. An inclusive workplace is one that welcomes diversity by creating an environment where different kinds of people can thrive and succeed.</p>
<p>As conversations around diversity and inclusion in the workplace have evolved, so too has the Women in Treasury initiative itself. The ways in which companies can create an inclusive environment and the need for continued promotion of diversity in the workplace were just some of the topics discussed at the most recent Women in Treasury London Forum.</p>
<p>Now in its sixth year, our global initiative continues to gain momentum and is playing a pivotal role celebrating and promoting representation and inclusion in the corporate finance space. This was highlighted by the presence of over 180 senior financial professionals, both male and female, from across the UK and Europe, who came together to network and learn from each other’s experiences.</p>

<h3 id="from-data-to-dialogue">From data to dialogue</h3>
<p>The week of the Women in Treasury London Forum was the first week that the data from the Women in Treasury Annual Global Study 2018 had been analysed and evaluated and the lucky attendees on the day were the first globally to hear the highlights from the upcoming report.</p>
<p>The day began with a networking session before an introduction from Sophie Jackson and Meg Coates, Joint Publishers, as they presented the background to the Women in Treasury initiative and shared some of the key highlights from the Women in Treasury Global Study 2018. The forum was the first time that the results had been publicly discussed, with the full report launching in October 2018. Here are some of the top-level highlights that were shared with the attendees:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The 2018 study profiled 348 women in corporate treasury. Nearly 57% of respondents in 2018 completed the study for the first time, meaning that this year’s responses reflect a new data-set with some eye-opening results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The majority of respondents were aged between 35 and 54 and have been working in treasury for more than ten years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Respondents are drawn from a vast array of industry sectors and are located across the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>25% of respondents are earning over £150,000 per annum, excluding benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just over half of respondents do not have dependent children and 47% do. 17.3% have other dependents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a fantastic display of the power of interpretation, this year’s respondents outlined for the first time what the term diversity means to them. Amongst them were ‘different perspectives’, ‘equality’ and ‘acceptance of others, of different beliefs, religion, race, gender and political preference’. It means working together to enhance the workplace, to understand and learn from each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>34% of respondents’ organisations have changed their approach to flexible working in the last 12-18 months, demonstrating its ongoing and ever-increasing importance. 69% of respondents say that where such arrangements exist they are available to all, regardless of gender. However 35% note that there is not equal uptake amongst both genders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regarding parental leave, encouragingly just over 29% of respondents notice significant numbers of men taking up their parental leave, however almost the same amount do not notice any men taking up the opportunity. 41% state that although some men take up the opportunity it is a minority of those who are eligible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just under 80% describe their company’s approach to diversity and inclusion as favourable or very favourable, which is fantastic as a first step towards attaining better representation and equality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Board representation unsurprisingly yields slightly less encouraging results. Only 17% of respondents are working for companies with a diverse board in terms of age, gender and ethnicity. 4.6% of companies have a female CEO and 24.6% have a female CFO.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diversity, inclusion and equal opportunities are recognised as key performance indicators (KPIs) at 24% of respondents’ companies.</p>
<br/>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<figure class="portrait right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0em 0em 2em;"><img alt="WIT London Woman talking 3" height="225" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/london-2018/2018-11and12-tt-04-wit__woman-speaking__ldn-wit-355__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=71C1A1E9B1939359868DAE86E8FA5B31" width="200"/><br/>
</figure>
<p>Respondents rated different criteria in order of importance for driving forward a diversity, inclusion and equal opportunity agenda. The top scored were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Leadership engagement and training.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agenda is led by a C-suite executive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leaders are held accountable for such agendas and KPIs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transparency on remuneration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the first time in the study’s history, support for quotas for women on boards has dramatically overtaken opposition to their use, with 44% in favour, 32% against and 24% unsure. 28% support a quota for ethnic diversity on boards and 44% do not, with 28% unsure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>39% of respondents did not feel they were paid the same as their male colleagues at a similar level of seniority and 32% feel they are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>37% of respondents have felt excluded from networking events, with the main reasons for this cited as gender, events being targeted at men, and age.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>79% believe that mentoring/sponsorship/coaching are key to a successful career and there are many interesting viewpoints on the various merits of the three.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>38% of respondents have moved overseas with their job and 50% believe that has helped advance their career journey. 52% would be willing to move overseas to advance their careers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Following the introductory speeches and presentation of the data highlights, our guests went through for lunch and were then treated to an all-star panel discussion featuring five leading industry speakers, all of whom are enjoying extraordinary careers.</p>
<p>This year’s panel included:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Séverine Le Blévennec, Director of EMEA Treasury, Honeywell</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Helen Hanby, ACMA, AMCT, Director, International Treasury, Biogen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Royston Da Costa, Assistant Group Treasurer, Ferguson Plc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Barbara Patow, Global Head of Correspondent Banking, Global Banking &amp; Markets, HSBC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeng Butler, Senior Managing Director and Global Head of Cash Business, State Street Global Advisors</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Sophie Jackson, facilitated the dynamic and lively debate, which was characterised by the open and honest views of the panel.</p>
<figure class="portrait left" style="float: left; margin: 0 2em 0em 0;"><img alt="WIT London Woman talking 2" height="225" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/london-2018/2018-11and12-tt-04-wit__woman-talking__ldn-wit-346__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=26A44D2B3F00BE93EA622C6D428E4929" width="200"/><br/>
</figure>
<h3 id="journeys-to-the-top">Journeys to the top</h3>
<p>The panel session began with an exploration of the panellists’ careers in corporate finance, the journeys they have each taken as well as the opportunities and challenges they have encountered along the way. Barbara Patow shared her journey to her current role as Global Head of Correspondent Banking from a background in risk and compliance, with some enlightening years spent working in anti-money laundering. Séverine Le Blévennec shared the gems of her decision to move to Honeywell after many loyal years working at General Motors, explaining, “it was a real opportunity for me and I have never regretted it. At Honeywell, I have been able to be proud of what I have achieved and what I have built.”</p>
<p>Royston da Costa described his beginnings in banking which have led to an esteemed 28-year career in treasury and spoke of his motivations in becoming a male ambassador for inclusion in the industry. Yeng Butler of State Street Global Advisors shared her very unique professional path working in finance and going back to graduate school and then working in the NGO sector, with a stint in micro-financing female-led businesses in Samoa before coming to State Street Global Advisors and climbing the ranks to her current role. Overall, although each panellist had followed very different paths to their current roles, one thing bound them all: they had all made bold changes at some stage, be that changing role, industry, location or a combination of all three.</p>
<h3 id="defining-moments">Defining moments</h3>
<p>Our panelists highlighted the stand-out moments that accelerated their paths to the top, with Helen Hanby speaking of her location moves at different moments and how that had affected her career journey. Said Helen, “For me, the really pivotal moment was accepting the expat assignment to Germany. I was the first female manager the company had ever had. I think they wondered what on earth had walked in, but it turned out to be an amazing couple of years, and absolutely shaped the next 20 years of my career, and actually my life. For me, it’s about seizing those opportunities.”</p>
<p>Séverine then talked about her career defining and ongoing appetite to learn which had enabled her to get ahead in her industry. Stepping outside of our defined job descriptions and really focusing on feeding our intellectual curiosity and seeing what we can learn that can bring new value to our work.</p>
<h3 id="external-encouragement">External encouragement</h3>
<p>What is interesting in our panellists’ accounts is that these brave steps were not taken alone. Support from mentors, organisations, friends or spouses was crucial in helping them make their decisions.</p>
<figure class="portrait right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0em 0em 2em;"><img alt="WIT London Woman smiling" height="225" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/london-2018/2018-11and12-tt-04-wit__woman-networking-and-smiling__ldn-wit-107__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=B7F41048D86DAD8789E725AFA091B0FF" width="200"/><br/>
</figure>
<p>Yeng explained her decision in one instance to make a big career move which was precipitated by a conversation with her mentor who asked her two questions, “Number one; are you fully challenged in the role that you have today? Two, do you feel like you are utilising everything you have learned in the various experiences that you’ve had? That was when I moved back to the north east to take the State Street role. If I think back to his impact and the questions that he asked, he didn’t have the answers but he knew the questions to ask. That is something that I strive for with the mentees that I have today. Because it isn’t about arriving at an answer per se, it’s about the journey.” Indeed, the role that mentoring, either official or unofficial, has played in our panellists’ career development reflected the responses to our Women in Treasury Global Study 2018, with 79% of respondents stating that mentoring was key to professional development.</p>
<h3 id="the-next-generation">The next generation</h3>
<p>Of the future of work and what we are aiming for, Helen said, “I think it’s a really exciting time for people to be entering the workplace, and it’s absolutely critical that we have a generationally diverse workforce in place. In a time of such flux and market disruption, I think that a generationally diverse workforce is absolutely best placed to deal with that.”</p>
<p>And on his hopes for the future, Royston shared the following, “I want equality to be based not on gender, ethnicity or any other aspect of diversity and that nothing should be impossible for anyone in the workplace. Those opportunities should be available for everyone. As my 19-year old daughter said, ‘a safer workplace in terms of being able to work, based on what you know and not who you are”.</p>
<figure class="portrait left" style="float: left; margin: 0 2em 0em 0;"><img alt="WIT London Woman talking" height="225" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/london-2018/2018-11and12-tt-04-wit__woman-talking__ldn-wit-356__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=898966572F598456C36A35A1F0D67EC8" width="200"/><br/>
</figure>
<p>What is clear is that businesses will need to change. The whole panel agreed that millennials are bringing a new way of thinking into businesses and disrupting traditional ways of working. The need therefore to build an inclusive workplace that welcomes people from different backgrounds, with different skillsets and experiences, is now a must. The discussion moved to the future and to giving back. Women in Treasury is a community that encourages collaboration and support and so it was heartening to hear the work that our panellists are doing in this space. Barbara explained, “It’s incumbent on me as a leader to educate the next generation to ensure that they can, and they know, they have the capability to do whatever they want to do.” One way she has sought to do so is by going in to speak with high school girls about career development, as she puts it: “They are a very tough audience! On a regular basis I go into sixth form colleges and state schools generally to give them an education into what they can do, to explain my journey coming from a working-class background and doing the job that I’m doing today.”</p>
<h3 id="more-to-come">More to come</h3>

<div class="copy__body"><p><em>2018’s vibrant panel discussion shone a spotlight on many of the challenges faced by women in treasury in the US today. Our panellists shared their individual stories of the challenges they’ve faced in their careers and gave inspirational accounts of how they have overcome many hurdles and gone on to build successful careers. Work-life balance was a recurring topic, as was choosing the right time to take a brave risk or make a bold career move. The benefits of a diverse team and how to create an inclusive working environment were also assessed. The importance of being authentic and true to oneself both at work and at home was another key theme. Finally the panellists each shared moving accounts of the people who had been most influential in their lives.</em></p>
<p>On Wednesday 10th October 150 senior treasury professionals gathered at The Pierre hotel in Midtown Manhattan to celebrate diversity at our third Women in Treasury New York Forum.</p>
<p>An inspirational line up of senior industry speakers shared their experiences and insights on a broad range of issues affecting many women and men working in treasury across the USA, whilst also offering some valuable advice to the audience.</p>
<p>The panel featured:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cisco – Debbie Kaya, Senior Director – Treasury, Global Cash and Operations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Core Scientific – Christy Barwick, Treasurer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HSBC – Nancy Pierce, Managing Director, Head of Payment Program, Global Liquidity and Cash Management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State Street Global Advisors – Pia McCusker, Senior Managing Director and Global Head of Cash Management</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The discussion was facilitated by Sophie Jackson, Joint Publisher and Head of Strategic Content at Treasury Today Group. The thought-provoking debate included topics such as mentoring, mobility and the value of building a strong and diverse team.</p>
<p>Sophie Jackson said: “It’s never felt more important to be here today to celebrate women in our industry. I’ve been delighted to see the fantastic representation for women there is here in the US at senior levels in corporate treasury and finance and the support from our readership in the US for the Women in Treasury initiative really been overwhelming!”</p>
<p>Following the panel discussion, an energetic and enthusiastic question and answer session took place, with audience members keen to find out more about our panellists’ careers and the challenges they have faced and overcome.</p>
<p>Commenting on the global Women in Treasury initiative, Meg Coates, Joint Publisher and Head of Operations, said: “At the heart of our Women in Treasury initiative is the Annual Global Study, the data from which forms the basis of our analysis of gender representation, diversity and inclusion in corporate treasury. We are excited to showcase the full report, for the first time, with our community here today in New York.”</p>
<h3 id="treasury-today-women-in-treasury-initiative">Treasury Today Women in Treasury initiative</h3>
<p>Treasury Today’s Women in Treasury initiative recognises the importance of equality and diversity across the corporate treasury profession and creates a means for women and men across the industry to communicate with one another, learn from each other and build relationships in order to help each other. Women need to be much more visible in their roles, both inside and outside of their organisations.</p>
<p>The Women in Treasury initiative seeks to offer a platform to make women more visible and to bring women and men together to discuss and celebrate diversity in the corporate space. As well as our forums, we also:</p>

<h4>What is the best piece of advice that you have been given in your career so far?</h4>
<p>To make sure that you proactively manage your career. This means mapping your goals – not necessarily for the course of your entire career, but over a few years – and taking proactive steps to meet them. The goals you set don’t always have to be based around changing your role or the company you work for; they can be about learning a new skill or gaining knowledge about a different industry. The key is to make sure you are always moving forward in a methodical and purposeful way.</p>
<h4>How much opportunity is there for career progression in the financial industry?</h4>
<p>There are many opportunities. However, they don’t always come to you directly; you must be open to identifying opportunities in the least likely places. This may sometimes mean taking a lateral step. It is important for women to understand that a career is a journey and not necessarily an upward trajectory all the time.</p>
<p>What has helped me is taking the time to sit down and map out my skills to see where they are applicable. This task also helps you understand your weaknesses and what you must do to get that promotion. You must be courageous in your decisions and willing to take a risk every now and again.</p>
<p>It is also crucial to find advocates throughout your career. I have been fortunate to have strong managers who have mentored me and sponsored my path towards running a team of my own. These people can help your career progress that much smoother. My advice to anyone with managers that aren’t championing your career progression is to look for other ways to gain new skills or exposure to other teams and consider using mentorship programmes.</p>
<h4>What is the most important lesson you’ve learned in your career to date?</h4>
<p>To act with humility. In a professional context, this includes being open to learning from other people’s points of view that differ from your own. Everyone has different experiences, understanding these allow us to arrive at the best solution. It also means admitting when you are wrong and coming up with a plan to fix it.</p>
<p>I believe in this so much; humility is a crucial attribute I look for when I am hiring for my team. I ask candidates what their biggest mistake or biggest challenge has been. It is a big red flag if they cannot provide an honest answer. It’s important for me to see that they can self-reflect as that attribute allows the broader team to perform at its best.</p>
<p>I must stress that being humble doesn’t mean not advocating for yourself. It means showing that you are human and able to self-reflect.</p>
<h4>What advice would you give to women in finance in terms of establishing and developing a career?</h4>
<p>Women tend to be held to a higher standard in industries where we are outnumbered by men. Because of this it is crucial for women to clearly articulate their ideas. My advice, therefore, is to take a public speaking course as this will help you clearly and coherently express the good ideas that you have. People often think that impressive public speakers have an innate gift. They don’t. It takes practice and is a skill that must be nurtured.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Personal development has been a strong theme throughout Yeng’s career, which began at Merrill Lynch. Yeng confesses that as a political science graduate she knew little about the industry at the time and joined the bank’s professional development programme to “learn something new”. It turned out to be a good choice, as Yeng has become a successful leader in her industry.</p>
<p>After spending two years rotating through the bank, Yeng settled in the institutional asset management business, focusing on short-term fixed income. Her career took an interesting detour when she decided to move to work in micro-finance in Western Samoa, providing small loans to women to help them start their own businesses. Reflecting upon this decision, Yeng notes that she felt, and still feels, passionately about women being given a chance to succeed. “My mother was an entrepreneur and it is a tough business,” she says. “I took this role to act on that passion and help give these fantastic women a chance to flourish.”</p>
<p>Today, Yeng leads State Street Global Advisors’ cash business, after spending the last eight years leading its strategic expansion. She explains that the past eight years have been immensely satisfying on many fronts, but what stands out is the team that she has built and the way in which it works together. “To see the team working to their full potential and utilising the skills they have is very gratifying,” she says. “I believe this is one of the main reasons that last year we were one of a few top institutional cash managers to gain market share, something I am very proud of.”</p>
<h3 id="setting-an-example">Setting an example</h3>
<p>As a highly respected female leader in finance, Yeng believes that she has a responsibility to help shape a better workplace. Most importantly, she wants to create a frictionless pathway for women to meet their career ambitions.</p>
<p>Yeng believes there’s already been progress in this regard. “I remember early in my career when a female colleague received a promotion and a gentleman next to me quipped that she only received the promotion because she was a woman,” says Yeng. “Comments like these were commonplace back then. Today, this doesn’t happen as much, if at all, and there are plenty of strong female leaders blazing a trail, which is a sign of how far we have come.”</p>
<p>That being said, some legacy issues remain. For example, Yeng says that women sometimes find it difficult to strike the optimal work-life balance. This is something Yeng admits falling foul of once or twice in her career. “I remember when I was on maternity leave and decided that I would check in with work for a few hours every week,” she says. “I didn’t need to do this; I had a newborn to focus on and it was very hard to zoom in and out of work at the same time. It was unfair on my child and on me.”</p>
<p>Most importantly, Yeng felt like this didn’t set a good example for other women in her team, something she is keen to do. “I remember feeling uneasy about it at the time because I didn’t want to be perceived as a ‘supermum’ that could do everything at once because that is unrealistic,” she says. “I was just trying to keep in touch with what was happening in the office.”</p>
<p>Indeed, setting an example and elevating the level of conversation around diversity in the workplace is a major objective for Yeng in the years ahead. “Through our work internally at State Street Global Advisors, and with Treasury Today’s Women in Treasury initiative, we are trying to do something impactful and play our part in creating a better world,” she concludes. “I am deeply passionate about this, and determined to make a difference.”</p></div>

<p><a class="button--red-stroke" href="#wit-silicon-valley-roadshow-2018-video-montage">Watch video montage</a></p>
<p><img alt="Fearless girl at the Silicon Valley WiT SSGA Roadshow" height="200" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/articles/2018/09/2018-09and10-tt-11-wit__img_1877__300x200.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=ABF4D9FB772C8383D40A678C96775E56" width="300"/></p>

<p>On May 17th in Palo Alto, California, Treasury Today, for the first time, brought its collaboration with State Street Global Advisors to the West Coast. This Silicon Valley-focused lunch gathering enabled a new network of corporate treasurers to hear from State Street Global Advisors and Treasury Today about their partnership on the 2018 Women in Treasury Study as well as to join a discussion group focused on the most recent Study results. Guests arrived at the beautiful Garden Court Hotel to enjoy a sunny lunchtime roundtable event, joined by a replica of State Street Global Advisors’ inspirational ‘Fearless Girl’, a statue that has come to represent the indomitable strength of women worldwide.</p>
<p>Sharing the results of the most recent <a href="/wit/study">Women in Treasury Annual Global Study</a> with the array of attendees based in the Bay area was a real privilege. The ensuing dialogue around flexibility, representation and broader topics of inclusion and career advancement was so well received by this new community that the conversation is sure to continue well beyond that awesome afternoon.</p>

<p>There was an intimate and trusting atmosphere that allowed those in the room to really open up about their experiences, both good and bad, in the workplace and to learn from one another as we debated the merits of various approaches to finding the career path we are best suited to. Raising your hand, being heard and knowing what you want were some of the recurring themes of the day.</p>
<p>Yeng Butler, Senior Managing Director and Global Head of Cash Business at State Street Global Advisors opened the discussion. Setting the tone for the afternoon Yeng said, ‘This is about action, action for yourselves in your professional lives, and also about action for each of your organisations. We’re looking forward to learning from your advice and personal experiences along with sharing data driven information from Treasury Today’s Women in Treasury Study.’</p>
<p>The future of work was an overarching topic of discussion, somewhat naturally given the fact that Silicon Valley is leading the way in terms of automation, robotics, discussions of Universal Basic Income and the impact that all of these advancements will have on people around the world. This narrative thread was highlighted in the expert session led by Louise Watts, co-founder of HPC Global, a boutique firm of international executive coaches located in Sydney, as she made a second guest appearance at our co-hosted roundtables to lead the day’s expert session.</p>
<p>Watts is working on a new people-focused future of work solution, Transition Hub, which will launch in Australia this October and is designed to help individuals develop their unique soft skills that they can apply to their future professional journey. This made her perfectly placed to help the treasury professionals in the room find their presence and focus on their personal development. Louise’s expert session featured implementable takeaways for everybody and galvanised the guests as they left for the day and went back to their professional lives.</p>
<p>The technology sector was heavily represented amongst attendees and the lunchtime discussion was peppered with talk of the specificities of gender equality not just in treasury but in the broader technology space, a unique marriage of two sometimes problematic industries. Also mentioned was the lack of a strong treasury community in the San Francisco area, which can make sharing best practice and personal career journey stories hard. It was therefore a heartening experience to bring these various companies and individuals together for the afternoon and to create a new community focused around mutual support and promoting diversity and inclusion in the industry.</p>
<p>As we dispersed into the sunny California afternoon there was a real sense of a dynamic new network having been created. The male attendees had volunteered to become inclusion ambassadors in our industry, spreading the message that it is important for everyone to come together and recognise diversity and inclusion as a core foundation of the best and brightest companies and leaders. We all learnt of the power of collaboration and collective action and we feel sure this West Coast community will grow in number and in spirit.</p>

<p><em>State Street Global Advisors and Treasury Today Group’s Women in Treasury Roundtables touch down in London.<br/>
</em></p>

<p> </p>
<p>On 10<sup>th</sup> May in the City of London, State Street Global Advisors and Treasury Today hosted the second in a new series of global roundtables dedicated to diversity and inclusion in corporate treasury. The London installation was a fantastic opportunity to share personal experiences and learn from each other in a facilitated dialogue, focusing on the data derived from the 2017 Treasury Today <a href="https://treasurytoday.com/women-in-treasury">Women in Treasury Global Study</a>.</p>
<p>State Street Global Advisors’ support of the diversity and inclusion dialogue is most clearly embodied in the Fearless Girl, a sculpture which has come to symbolise the indomitable strength of women and instantly garnered worldwide attention after it was unveiled on 8<sup>th</sup> March 2017 (International Women’s Day). State Street Global Advisors’ Women in Treasury roundtables have been taken to a new level in 2018 as they have partnered with the Treasury Today Group and are proudly supporting our Women in Treasury Annual Global Study. They are taking us on the road with them throughout the course of this year as we bring our study statistics to life in dialogues with corporates in key locations. These events provide us with a rare opportunity to hear what the results mean in real terms for corporate treasury professionals and to come together to pave the way for a better and brighter working future.</p>

<p>Treasury Today’s Women in Treasury initiative was created six years ago and has been driving the diversity dialogue in the corporate treasury space ever since. The initiative now incorporates an annual Global Study into the corporate female experience along with global forums, regular profiles of female corporate finance professionals, a dedicated LinkedIn networking group, and now, this new series of intimate focus group sessions dedicated to discussing the study findings.</p>
<p>The London lunchtime session brought a group of more than 30 industry professionals together for a discussion around the key findings from the most recent Women in Treasury Global Study. The event began with a networking coffee session, where guests arrived at an opulent venue in the City of London and were photographed with a resin replica of the Fearless Girl statue.</p>
<p class="portrait right" style="float:right;margin:0 0 0em 2em;"><img alt="Lynn Lochhead from John Lewis having her photo taken with the Fearless Girl" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/forum/2016-11-12-tt-02-wit-woman-networking-200x225/2018-07and08-tt-03-wit__lynn-lochhead-john-lewis-photo-with-fearless-girl__1160__200x225.jpg?h=225&amp;w=200&amp;la=en&amp;hash=5B6AE8C30F0C1F719D30C618C472C80E" style="height: 225px; width: 200px;"/></p>
<p>This was followed by an introductory speech from Yeng Butler, Senior Managing Director and Global Head of Cash Business at State Street Global Advisors as guests came together around a beautifully laid, full-length walnut table. “A year ago, we placed the Fearless Girl in the heart of New York City’s financial district,” said Yeng. “The impact this had around the world in respect to starting conversations about diversity was overwhelming. Our work with Treasury Today’s Women in Treasury initiative is building on this to ensure the conversation develops and to drive long-lasting change.”</p>
<p>Beginning with an expert session interview with Cornelia Hesse, Head of Controlling at BASF in Germany and a keen and inspiring supporter of development in the treasury industry, guests were fortunate enough to hear Cornelia’s key advice and learn from anecdotes from her career. The atmosphere was animated, as attendees asked candid questions of Cornelia and shared insights from their own triumphs and trials in the workplace.</p>

<p>After a break for some sumptuous desserts, Treasury Today’s Joint Publisher &amp; Head of Strategic Content, Sophie Jackson then moved to facilitate a dialogue around the key findings from the Women in Treasury 2017 Annual Global Study. The London chapter of our Women in Treasury shared advice with the other treasurers in the room and there was an incredibly engaged, candid and supportive atmosphere in the room. We sought engagement with our Women in Treasury 2018 Global Study, and which we invite all female corporate treasury professionals to complete before the study closes on 17<sup>th</sup> August 2018.</p>
<p>The Women in Treasury Annual Global Study roadshow events with State Street Global Advisors will continue throughout the course of the year in various locations across the world and the 2018 Women in Treasury Annual Global Study results will be released in September.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>On Wednesday April 25<sup>th</sup> 2018 over 150 senior treasury professionals from throughout Asia Pacific gathered at the Four Seasons hotel in Singapore to debate diversity at Treasury Today’s fifth Women in Treasury Singapore Forum.</em></p>
<p>Record numbers of treasury and finance professionals from across the region came together in Singapore to celebrate and champion women in treasury. If there was a sign needed that the topic of gender diversity is growing in importance it would be that in its fifth year, Treasury Today’s Asia latest chapter of our Women in Treasury Forums has never been so well attended or so buzzing with energy.</p>
<p>Treasury Today’s Women in Treasury initiative was established to pioneer women in our industry and to create a new professional community where we share our experiences and encourage each other’s professional development. Over the six years since the Women in Treasury initiative started, we have seen such a shift in the mainstream cultural consciousness, with companies across the board recognising a focus on diversity and inclusion as fundamentally important if they wish to be successful businesses of the future.</p>
<p>Singapore has played host to all of the Treasury Today Group’s Women in Treasury Singapore Forums to date and it is a particularly special place to host such events. Singapore is a great location to speak about gender diversity and equality, as there is just such fantastic representation for women in the country state at senior levels in corporate treasury and finance, and the support from the treasury community in Singapore for the Women in Treasury initiative has been so strong.</p>
<p>At a broader level, the Singaporean government has been incredibly vocal of its plans to push for better representation at board level, with a target of 20% female representation on boards by 2020. Although at board level female representation remains low, in corporate treasury there are a great number of women enjoying brilliant careers and sharing best practice in this region which can only facilitate a dialogue that pushes for progress at all levels.</p>
<h3 id="key-themes-of-the-day">Key themes of the day</h3>
<p>The most recent Singapore forum, hosted in late April of this year, offered a platform for a diverse line-up of senior industry figures to share their experiences and insights on a broad range of issues affecting many women and men working in treasury across the region, whilst also offering some valuable advice to the audience.</p>
<p>During the pre-lunch reception, the forum was opened by Meg Coates, Joint Publisher &amp; Head of Operations, and Sophie Jackson, Joint Publisher &amp; Head of Strategic Content, who introduced the Women in Treasury initiative and presented the results of the most recent Women in Treasury Annual Global Study. Meg gave an overview of the study, presenting the following findings:</p>
<p>‘The 2017 online study was conducted from May to September 2017 and was the fifth Women in Treasury Study. The global study attracted 352 responses from a broad universe in terms of experience, age, geography and role.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/treasury-talent/2018-07and08-tta-03-wit__meg-giving-speech-to-guests__1298__625x225/2018-07and08-tta-03-wit__woman-asking-question-to-panel__1945__200x225.jpg?h=225&amp;w=200&amp;la=en&amp;hash=03FDFB0499E9788BB3AA3106C160A282" style="float: right; margin: 2em 0em 0em 2em; height: 225px; width: 200px;"/></p>
<p>Some of the key themes raised by the respondents to the 2017 study were as follows:</p>
<p>The majority of respondents were aged between 35 and 54 and 50% have dependent children. More than half have been in a treasury role for over ten years.</p>
<p>It was clear that flexibility in the workplace is integral to enabling both women and men to return to work in a way that supports them and their families, with 30% of respondents to the 2017 Study stating that their organisation had changed its approach to flexible working in the past year, which would imply that attitudes to flexible working are improving.</p>
<p>On the topic of gender parity regarding pay and opportunities, 41% of respondents said they felt they earnt less than their male counterparts, which has shockingly increased 12% on last year.</p>
<p>Only 6% felt there had been improvements in pay parity over the past year, with over a quarter of respondents feeling overlooked and ignored in the workplace because of their gender.</p>
<p>More encouragingly, the majority of respondents characterised their company’s approach to diversity, inclusion and equal opportunity as favourable, with over three quarters of companies already having strategies in place.</p>
<p>On the topic of quotas for board representation, over 40% of respondents felt there should be a quota for female representation on boards. 39% said no and 17% weren’t sure.</p>
<img alt="" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/singapore-2018/2018-07and08-tta-03-wit__toni-weber-laughing__1621__200x225.jpg?h=225&amp;w=200&amp;la=en&amp;hash=12D8E69387B6DDA587AF37E6B19C405F" style="float: left; margin: 2em 2em 0em 0; height: 225px; width: 200px;"/> 
<p>It is disappointing not to have seen more progress at board level over the five years since the initiative began. Will we still be debating the merits of quotas in 20 years? The case for having more women on boards is stronger than ever. Not only does research show that companies with more women in executive positions report stronger financial results, but the reputational and brand advantages are also significant. Yet, the numbers remain very small: on a global basis, just 9% of CEOs and Managing Directors are women. From our respondents, just 7.5% have a female CEO.</p>
<p>Mentoring and sponsorship programmes received incredibly positive responses. Over 70% of respondents to the 2017 study felt these were key to a successful career.</p>
<p>On the subject of networking and social events, 35% of respondents have felt excluded. The main reasons cited were gender and parental responsibilities.”</p>
<h3 id="deep-discussion">Deep discussion</h3>
<p>With this, the introductory part of the afternoon came to a close as guests then moved through to a three course lunch and sat down to hear from our roll call of expert panellists.</p>
<p>The Women in Treasury 2018 Singapore Forum panellists were:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Florence Tan</strong>, Head, Treasury, APAC, M+W Group</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Christopher Emslie</strong>, Asia Regional Treasurer, General Mills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Crystina Hickey</strong>, CFA, Vice President, BlackRock</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Chédia Haddouchi</strong>, Treasury Manager, APAC, Uber</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The panel discussion was facilitated by Treasury Today’s Sophie Jackson and the thought provoking debate included topics such as taking charge of one’s own professional destiny, mentoring, mobility and the value of building a strong and diverse team.</p>
<img alt="" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/singapore-2018/2018-07and08-tta-03-wit__bonnie-yang-during-drinks-reception__0990__200x225.jpg?h=225&amp;w=200&amp;la=en&amp;hash=5434250571DE3D8874397C56E13013CB" style="float: right; margin: 0em 0em 0em 2em; height: 225px; width: 200px;"/>
<p>Beginning with discussing the draw to the treasury profession, the panel discussion explored the motivations behind both Florence Tan of M+W Group and Chédia Haddouchi of Uber’s career choices to date, focusing on what makes a role in treasury unique. As Florence explained, ‘I think that the treasury skill set is very scalable. We need to learn about the company, the business and the product. It’s important to learn about the different infrastructures of the countries that the company operates in, learn about the different payment methods, regulatory environment, FX regulations and so on.’</p>
<p>Chédia added the following around her enjoyment and choice of the profession, ‘In treasury you have to collaborate with a lot of people from across the business. So I think as a treasury person it’s really in the DNA, to be able to collaborate, whether it’s people from legal, tax or other functions across the business. This is really a very central and unique position that only treasury people and a few corporate functions in companies have, and this is something I really enjoy! The other aspect of treasury that I’ve learned to love over the years is really the adrenalin rush that we have in our daily roles, because you never know what’s going to happen during the day! That was not so fun at the beginning of my career, but over time and with experience you become more comfortable with the “unexpected”, you know how to react, you know who to reach out to and that’s a part of the job I’ve really learned to enjoy.’</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Flexibility in the workplace is integral to enabling both women and men to return to work in a way that supports them and their families.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crystina Hickey of BlackRock spoke of her own career journey and of the critical importance of being clear and vocal about what you want to do with your career. From her own experience of requesting an interview for a position, she had learnt that being open and clear about your needs and career goals is important within your organisation. Crystina explained that whilst we may not always get everything we want, taking the initiative and voicing an opinion is something she reminds herself to do on a daily basis.</p>
<img alt="" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/singapore-2018/2018-07and08-tta-03-wit__man-during-drinks-reception__2324__200x225.jpg?h=225&amp;w=200&amp;la=en&amp;hash=C7372BA90342D4A7E2E69F863BF5580C" style="float: left; margin: 2em 2em 0em 0; height: 225px; width: 200px;"/> 
<p>Chris Emslie of General Mills is a South African native and spent the majority of his career working there in treasury before a move to Asia in recent years and to his current role in Singapore at General Mills. Chris spoke of the changes and developments to the diversity and inclusion dialogue that he has seen over this time and the fantastic example his current employer is setting with regards to female representation, ‘I think it was about ten years ago I walked into my first treasury conference with ABB, out of 60 treasurers there were two female treasurers, and the rest were all support staff. Most of those senior positions were taken by men and everybody else just filled into those support roles. I think as I’ve seen over the years, and moving to Asia and of course moving to General Mills now, my direct boss is a woman, my Vice President Finance – Asia and Latin America is a woman, our Group President – Asia and Latin America is a woman. Forty percent of our senior management staff in Asia at the moment are women and overall per our staff complement 45% are women out of a total workforce in the region of 10,000. That’s the change that I’ve seen over the last 20 years as diversity has started to come in. It’s not everywhere, we all need to learn that, but it is coming.’</p>
<p>The panel moved to discuss broader concepts of diversity and inclusion, with Crystina speaking of the value of diversity of thought and diversity of perspective, both of which are critical in driving forward powerful collaborative ideas. Crystina added that the inclusion piece of the puzzle involves those diverse thoughts and perspectives being well received, with all members of a team feeling confident and comfortable that their views will be heard and their positions respected.</p>
<p>Conversation then swiftly moved to the critical and increasing importance of flexibility in the workplace. In our 2017 study the results indicated that 30% of respondent’s organisations had recently changed their approach to flexibility as this becomes more commonplace and accepted as central to the fruitful future of work. Our panel debated the difficulties involved with balancing flexibility and working from home with the need for visibility within one’s organisation when forging forward with an ambitious career plan.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>35% of respondents to Treasury Today’s Women in Treasury Study 2017 have felt excluded. The main reasons cited were gender and parental responsibilities.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Issues around quotas, board representation and the tricky trailblazing that female board members across the world are having to engage in followed suit, before moving to discuss mentoring and the people that have inspired and supported our panellists’ careers to date. Other issues discussed included mobility, how we place value on different individuals and on our (hopefully) bright and inclusive working future.</p>
<p>Following the panel discussion, a lively and enthusiastic question and answer session took place, with many questions raised by the audience. This gave the panel the opportunity to share further insights from their own careers and the challenges they have faced and overcome. It was a fantastic dialogue, enriched by the candour and forthcoming approach to the afternoon that was adopted by both the panellists onstage and the (female and male) attendees from the world of corporate treasury.</p>

<p>Against a backdrop of uncertainty and change on the global geopolitical scene, it is very encouraging to see the dialogue around diversity and inclusion grow in significance and the rallying cries for progress increase in volume. Commenting on the success of the event, Sophie Jackson said, ‘As we approached the sixth anniversary of Treasury Today’s Women in Treasury initiative it was fantastic in Singapore to take stock of how far our industry has come in that time. The Women in Treasury initiative is constantly growing and expanding, driven forward by the women and men who are part of our community and who lend their voices to our conversations around diversity, inclusion and representation in corporate treasury. It was a galvanising experience to see this community thriving in Singapore last April.’</p>
<p>Treasury Today Group’s Women in Treasury initiative recognises the importance of women in the corporate treasury profession and creates a means for women in treasury to communicate with one another, learn from each other and build relationships in order to help each other. The Women in Treasury initiative seeks to offer a platform to make women more visible and to bring people together to discuss and celebrate diversity in the corporate space.</p>

<p><em>On March 8<sup>th</sup> in New York on International Women’s Day, State Street Global Advisors and Treasury Today hosted the first of a series of global roundtables dedicated to diversity and inclusion in corporate treasury. The launch session was both a networking opportunity and a lesson in personal development, focusing on the data derived from the 2017 Treasury Today Women in Treasury Global Study.</em></p>
<p><a class="button--red-stroke" href="#wit-ny-roadshow-2018-video-montage">Watch video montage</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>March 8<sup>th</sup> 2018 marked the one year anniversary of the unveiling of State Street’s Fearless Girl, a sculpture erected overnight in New York of a ten year old female child, her hands placed firmly on her hips facing down the iconic bull on Wall Street. The sculpture came to symbolise the indomitable strength of women and instantly garnered worldwide attention. A social media frenzy swiftly followed its unveiling as people from across the world flocked to have their photograph taken with the sculpture. Originally intended as a temporary installation, the popularity of the sculpture will see the Fearless Girl become a permanent feature in the city. All this made March 8<sup>th</sup> the perfect day to launch the first in 2018’s roundtable events with State Street Global Advisors.</p>
<p>Treasury Today’s Women in Treasury initiative was created five years ago and has been driving the diversity dialogue in the corporate treasury space ever since. The initiative now incorporates an annual Global Study into the corporate female experience along with global Forums, regular profiles of female corporate finance professionals, a dedicated LinkedIn networking group, and now, this new series of intimate focus group sessions dedicated to discussing the study findings.</p>

<p><em>State Street Global Advisors and Treasury Today launch global partnership on Women in Treasury Global Study 2018</em></p>
</aside>
<p>The inaugural session was hosted above the heady heights of Times Square in New York City and brought a group of 20 industry professionals together for a lunchtime discussion of key findings from the 2017 Women in Treasury Global Study. The event began with a networking coffee session where guests arrived at the Convene on the 23<sup>rd</sup> floor towering above Midtown Manhattan and were photographed with a resin replica of the Fearless Girl statue.</p>
<p>This was followed by an introductory speech from Yeng Butler, Senior Managing Director and Global Head of Cash Business of State Street Global Advisors as guests enjoyed a sumptuous three course lunch. Pia McCusker, Senior Managing Director – Global Head of Cash Management added sound bites around her personal professional journey and the work that State Street Global Advisors are doing in this space. Said Yeng, ‘It is about action. Actionable ideas for yourself, as senior leaders in your organisation, actionable ideas for your organisations in driving diversity of thought and inclusion. Let me leave a compelling example of this action and reaction resulting from Fearless Girl arriving exactly a year ago. As part of our asset stewardship role at State Street Global Advisors, as a result of Fearless Girl coming on March 8<sup>th</sup> of last year, 152 companies have now committed to add a female in their board. To me, there isn’t any more compelling evidence that there is a reaction to the action, I think that is just something that I want to leave you with as we have this vibrant discussion this afternoon.’</p>
<p>Over lunch Treasury Today’s Joint Publisher &amp; Head of Strategic Content, Sophie Jackson facilitated a dialogue around the key findings from the Women in Treasury 2017 Annual Global Study with particular attention to the topics of flexibility, representation, mentorship, parity and driving change in organisations. The lively dialogue these statistics provoked was incredibly eye opening and the findings really came to life as corporate treasurers outlined in real terms their experiences of these statistics and their unique personal journeys to the careers that they enjoy now.</p>
<p>Our diverse group shared advice with the other treasurers in the room and there was an enthusiastic and supportive atmosphere on the day, built on a keen awareness of the challenges female professionals currently face. We sought insight from the corporate treasurers in the room in advance of the launch of the Women in Treasury 2018 Global Study on April 3<sup>rd</sup> 2018, proudly supported by State Street Global Advisors, which we invite all female corporate treasury professionals to complete.</p>

<p>Discussion of the Women in Treasury 2017 Annual Global Study was followed by an expert session interview with Louise Watts, co-founder of High Performance Coaching based in Sydney, who works extensively with organisations on the future of work and with individuals on their personal brand building, development and coaching. Louise shared some great insights from her own journey with actionable takeaways for attendees to encourage taking charge of ones’ professional presence and destiny.</p>
<p>The Women in Treasury Annual Global Study roadshow events with State Street Global Advisors will continue globally throughout the course of the year in various locations and the 2018 Women in Treasury Annual Global Study results will be released in September.</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p><em>On Thursday 14<sup>th</sup> October 2017, Treasury Today hosted the second New York installation of our Women in Treasury Forum. A fresh new format with fantastic, energetic panellists was the order of the day at The Pierre hotel in Midtown Manhattan.</em></p>
<p>Attendees from the world of treasury, technology and finance gathered to network, share ideas and discuss points arising from the 2017 Women in Treasury Global Study. They also came, of course, to hear from the panel, a line-up comprised of five industry experts:</p>

<p>The forum couldn’t have come at a more opportune moment in the US, coming towards the end of a year of global political developments that have made the conversation around diversity and inclusion more important than ever. With women’s rights, and indeed human rights, being challenged, and with female representation in the US falling at the highest government and institutional levels, now is the moment for women to make their voices heard.</p>
<p>The day began with a networking drinks reception and a speech from Meg Coates, Associate Publisher EMEA &amp; Americas, Treasury Today Group, who highlighted key findings from the 2017 Women in Treasury Global Study. Three hundred and fifty-two female corporates from across the world participated in the study, which sits at the heart of the Women in Treasury initiative and maps the treasury profession’s path to diversity.</p>
<img alt="Group shot of panellists on stage" height="201" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/forum/2018-01and02-tt-04-wit__2017-wit-nwyk-036__625x201.jpg?h=201&amp;w=625&amp;la=en&amp;hash=FF5CC154B43C3AB56012214A648F577D" style="height: 201px; width: 625px;" width="625"/> 
<p>The subsequent panel discussion focused on some of the key themes raised by the study respondents. Moderated by Sophie Jackson, Associate Group Publisher, Treasury Today Group, the conversation centred around what the terms diversity and inclusion really mean for a modern US corporate audience. The panel also addressed issues of visibility for women and minorities. Honing in on the specifics of corporate treasury and finance, and highlighting the stumbling blocks to greater representation, the panel’s overwhelming tone was energetic and determined, with many impactful calls to action for the audience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Women have historically faced greater barriers than men when it comes to participating in the workforce. Initiatives such as Women in Treasury are geared towards eliminating disparities and providing opportunities for women to advance within the workplace.”</p>
<p><cite>Eugenia Solache, Director International Treasury, CBS</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="understanding-diversity">Understanding diversity</h3>
<p>After lunch, the panel discussion kicked off with an assessment of what ‘diversity’ meant for the panellists as modern professionals in the US. Eric Houser of Wells Fargo commented that diversity means representation and that we cannot speak of diversity without thinking of inclusion – in other words, listening to the representation around the table. He pointed out that it is one thing to get people around the table, and another thing to listen to what they all have to say.</p>
<p>Susan Mercer added that over the course of her 25-year career at Cargill she has seen the dialogue around diversity shift and evolve, with people now thinking more about diversity of thought and diversity of experience.</p>
<img alt="Room full of people for the drinks reception" height="200" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/new-york-2017/2018-01and02-tt-04-wit__2017-wit-nwyk-123__300x200.jpg?h=200&amp;w=300&amp;la=en&amp;hash=DC7950B541BFA85D36870F92D0F220A8" style="height: 200px; width: 300px;" width="300"/> 
<p>Diversity of thought – in other words, diversity in the way you think and the things that you think – and diversity of experience are good places to start in order to get diversity in teams. However she pointed out that the talent pool is still not as varied as it needs to be and there is still work to be done.</p>
<p>On the theme of diversity in the workplace, Karen Gilhooly of HSBC stated that an ideal working environment brings different people together and gives them the chance to share their experiences and ideas. She explained that this should mean focusing on diversity of thought, rather than an arbitrary concept of what a diverse group looks like. By looking for a certain type of individual, people run the risk of creating the opposite of a diverse environment.</p>
<h3 id="achieving-visibility">Achieving visibility</h3>
<p>Mary Gilbert of Duracell moved the conversation to focus on visibility, explaining that, for her, visibility means exposure. She went on to add that sometimes people simply work hard and hope that the hard work will be noticed. However, if they are not “kicking doors down” and showing management what they are capable of, they may miss an opportunity for advancement. In a competitive work environment, it is therefore crucial that people demonstrate their capabilities to others.</p>
<p>Jenifer Herdin of Viacom added to the topic of women’s visibility by using the analogy of a pipeline. Talent is brought in at the start, but as women progress through their careers they start to miss key developments and promotions at a managerial level. Higher up in the organisation, men start to outnumber the women two-to-one, with representation then decreasing even further, explained Herdin.</p>
<h3 id="different-roles-and-different-locations">Different roles and different locations</h3>
<p>Susan Mercer’s career at Cargill has seen her gain experience in a wide range of roles and work in different locations over the course of her career. When asked in the panel discussion about the importance of rotation and mobility for a treasurer’s career advancement, Mercer explained that there are many different roles which are integral to treasury. Having experience across cash management and debt capital markets, and having experience of different geographies, is incredibly valuable.</p>
<p>Mercer explained that she had also spent time working in Asia, which brought a completely different experience compared to working for a North American company based in North America. Having the willingness to experience something different and learn new skills had, she felt, been important for her career development.</p>
<p><img alt="Sophie Jackson, Susan Mercer and Karen Gilhooly" height="260" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/forum/2018-01and02-tt-04-wit__group-of-photos-01__625x260.jpg?h=260&amp;w=625&amp;la=en&amp;hash=E2CE00B4A4E8001984D30D8CEE2B4E86" style="height: 260px; width: 625px;" width="625"/></p>
<p>Karen Gilhooly spoke of the importance of flexibility, or ‘balancing’, over the course of her career in banking. Gilhooly shared the experience at the beginning of her career of being placed in a role which included travelling. With none of today’s communication capabilities available to her, she needed to learn from the very beginning how to balance different aspects of life. After having her first child at the midpoint of her career, Gilhooly adjusted and relished the opportunity to figure out how to balance things, making compromises from time to time.</p>
<h3 id="flexibility">Flexibility</h3>
<p>The panel was in agreement around the very real importance of flexibility for all in the workplace, men and women. At different stages of people’s lives and careers, they may need more or less time in the office. People may get ill; they may have responsibilities – and it is paramount that they receive the support they need from their organisations at these different stages. That is how companies can retain their talent and get the best out of their staff.</p>
<h3 id="seeking-opportunities">Seeking opportunities</h3>
<p>On the subject of personal development and guidance, Jenifer Herdin’s advice was to seek more opportunities and to ask for feedback. When coming out of university, people are typically used to being graded, receiving feedback and having a dialogue. Then, in the workplace, they may have just one appraisal a year, where they are subject to one person’s opinion. So seeking out feedback more willingly is useful, she said.</p>
<p>Additionally, raising your hand for projects and opportunities at work is very important. Herdin explained that the person who raises their hand is not always the most qualified, and that many people can struggle with this. People should put themselves out there and brand themselves so that when projects arise they are uppermost in mind, she stated.</p>
<p>Mary Gilbert spoke of the journey not ending once you are given a seat at the table. If you have a seat at the table, you have a voice – and you should really use it, Gilbert explained. If you can’t use your seat at the table in a proactive way, let someone else take the seat, she added.</p>
<h3 id="leading-the-way">Leading the way</h3>
<p>Gilbert also shared her experiences of being mentored by inspiring professionals over the course of her career. Most memorable was when she spoke of her own work mentoring young, at-risk pupils at her old high school in Chicago. Gilbert described it as one of the highlights of her life to be able to inspire young people to use their voice and to break the mould. She spoke of a recent mentee who had historically struggled with authority but who had recently been accepted to become a police offer in Chicago. This story was greeted by a round of high fives for Gilbert from the other panellists!</p>
<p><img alt="" height="260" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/forum/2018-01and02-tt-04-wit__group-of-photos-02__625x260.jpg?h=260&amp;w=625&amp;la=en&amp;hash=B23129DBB0AF0F21DAC0CFE5FA61F089" style="height: 260px; width: 625px;" width="625"/> </p>
<p>Eric Houser followed up with his own experiences of working with the next generation of professionals. As is common in the technology space in San Francisco, Houser works alongside millennials. He explained that this generation is often described as “entitled” – but he disagreed that this is the case, noting that millennials have simply grown up in a different style and that it is incumbent upon older professionals to adapt.</p>
<p>He added that this millennial mindset doesn’t fit the corporate environment per se, but that companies must adapt and accommodate as best they can or they will not have a workforce of millennials. The other important part of this dynamic, explained Houser, is listening to millennials. If you neglect to have the millennial decision-making perspective in your companies, he said, you are missing a very large piece of the future.</p>
<p>Whether seeking out a mentor or just looking for general guidance, the importance of being bold, reaching out and just asking somebody for a cup of coffee was highlighted by both Jenifer Herdin and Susan Mercer. They noted that when people are in companies where a formal mentoring programme may not be available, it can be unclear how people can take matters into their own hands.</p>
<p>Several of the panellists also spoke of the importance of managing upwards as well as downwards. They explained that people should ask for what they need from their bosses and give them a chance to adjust before giving up. Likewise, the panellists noted that if people encounter a problematic dynamic with any of their seniors, they should explain these difficulties.</p>

<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>At the end of a fantastic afternoon full of inspiring anecdotes, the main takeaways from those in the room were around the importance of speaking out, using your voice and presence, and taking and earning your seat at the table. There was also a passionate message around the importance of giving back to the next generation and pushing forward to create a better working future for all.</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p><i>Diversity is not about hitting targets, it is about building a culture where everyone can thrive. The panel of Treasury Today’s latest Women in Treasury Forum in London sought to address the theme, open up an advanced dialogue and offer our audience some positive strides forward.</i></p>
<i></i><br/>
<p>“Until we walk a mile in someone else’s shoes, we will never truly understand their professional experience.” It would be hard to disagree with this sentiment, put forward at this year’s Women in Treasury London Forum held in September. Indeed, delivering true diversity and inclusion will only be possible once we all begin to think in entirely new ways, reassessing how we perceive each other.</p>
<p>With over 180 senior treasury professionals from the UK and Europe attending the event and with similar events taking place in Asia and North America – the themes of diversity and inclusion seem now to be becoming embedded in the consciousness of the treasury world.</p>
<p>There needs to be more willingness to step outside of our own experience to avoid behaviour that can make people feel uncomfortable or see them overlooked for promotions. But in the fast-paced world in which we live, it can be all too easy to forget that those around us have their own set of struggles that may impact how they behave.</p>
<p>Organisations have a role to play in encouraging tolerance and helping to promote diverse thinking, especially around hiring practices. All too often, managers hire people who reflect themselves or replicate the profile of previous high-performers. The result is a failure to promote diversity whilst simultaneously encouraging the creative-limiting practice of group-think. Building and implementing policies can go some way to ensuring checks and balances are in place to avoid such counterproductive outcomes. But what are we really aiming for when we talk about ‘diversity’?</p>
<h3 id="thinking-diversity">Thinking diversity</h3>
<figure class="portrait right"><img alt="People sat down for lunch, networking at their tables" height="225" src="/i/2017/11/2017-11and12-tt-03-wit__lunch__200x225.jpg" style="float:left;margin-right:2em;margin-bottom:2em;" width="200"/></figure>
<p>In seeking a definition, Frances Hinden, VP, Treasury Operations, Shell International, argues that diversity is not about being male or female, your race or your appearance, “it is about how you think”.</p>
<p>A diverse group of people will naturally think differently, based on a whole host of drivers, from nurture to nature. Of course, if diversity is about thought, then it will not be possible to tell simply by looking at that group if it is diverse.</p>
<p>This argument starts to pull away from the traditional views of workplace diversity. Indeed, for Cornelia Hesse, Head of Controlling, BASF Global Finance Shared Services, the traditional topics of gender and race in her company have already been supplanted by “life-balance issues”, where interesting part-time roles are made available to all, and proper parental leave for men and women is the norm. The company has also developed a “competencies-based” approach to hiring into teams, encouraging more soft skills to come to the fore so that leaders are now in effect “orchestrating” the players rather than simply issuing commands.</p>
<p>Having already reached out to more and to varied personalities, the company is transitioning yet again, said Hesse. This time its approach is being forged as a direct response to the digital agenda, where global reach within the business is being stretched to the limit. To succeed here, there is a push for empowering satellite team members so that a truly diverse organisation is created. Technology can then be employed to bring the different skillsets together and to stay connected, helping to drive the overarching goals of the business forward.</p>
<h3 id="different-sectors-same-challenges">Different sectors, same challenges</h3>
<p>With her experience across a number of sectors, Sabine McIntosh, Managing Director, Global Head of Account Services, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi, is of the impression that the challenges to diversity remain much the same in each of them.</p>
<p>With the vast majority of senior managers and board members being men, regardless of sector, she feels diversity persists as a topic for all major global corporations. Interestingly, McIntosh notes that in her experience, diversity is far less of an issue in smaller businesses where she says it was “easier to demonstrate performance and be recognised for it”. This suggests that it can be harder to be visible in the corporate world. Change calls for a different viewpoint.</p>
<p>“When we talk about diversity, we need to view it from the board and even the shareholder level,” says McIntosh. “It’s about trying to look for and value different behaviours that are going to start balancing out the organisation from the top down.”</p>
<p>In the world of treasury today, the male domination we see stems from a time when banks really were male strongholds, especially in the dealing rooms, explains Peter Lay, Head of Global Treasury, Oxfam. “As a treasurer, if you played golf or went fly fishing, you would fit the mould of corporate entertainment of the time,” he notes. There was little room for thinking otherwise and few women it seemed wanted to join that particular club.</p>
<p>With a diverse working background beginning in South Africa, Lay’s arrival in a UK finance function, where the MD even controlled what women wore at work, was a bemusing experience. “But there didn’t seem to be any anger about the treatment of women,” he recalls. He found it similarly odd that for any male that didn’t play golf, membership of the elite circle was all but barred.</p></div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>As the 90s progressed, Lay notes that whilst more women were taking senior roles, many firms were in fact merely exploiting perceived gender differences. Women were seen as having strength in terms of their relationship skills but were not seen in any other light; it was a direct route to HR management in certain industries but higher executive roles were still seemingly off limits.</p>
<p>Lay’s move to the British Council saw a different approach unveiled. Women were actively making a difference, championing culture and education across the world. And yet even here, very few women ever made it to board level. Notwithstanding, Lay’s current experience with Oxfam, which has been a “revelation” in terms of genuine diversity, he feels that whilst US banking is making enormous headway, its British counterpart “still has a way to go”.</p>
<figure class="portrait left"><img alt="People networking during the drinks reception" height="208" src="/i/2017/11/2017-11and12-tt-03-wit__few-people-networking__625x208.jpg" width="625"/></figure>
<h3 id="mobile-solution">Mobile solution</h3>
<p>Different attitudes to diversity prevail on the international circuit. It may be that to move ahead, geographic mobility may provide the best opportunities. This has certainly been the case for Deborah Mur, Head of Global Liquidity and Cash Management, HSBC France. Indeed, she feels that her willingness to be mobile has played a vital role in her progress. But it has not been about “taking any job and moving to any country”.</p>
<p>Instead, Mur has deliberately identified opportunities and actively sought solutions to help the company, an approach that, for example, saw her relocate to Canada for a period. The overseas moves she has made, in this context, have largely been “strategic” measures to drive new openings for herself.</p>
<p>However, these openings don’t have to come from geographic mobility, she says. “You can do the same thing across business lines if you identify an opportunity, transferring best practice as you go.”</p>
<p>Taking the long way around has certainly enabled McIntosh’s career progression. Having taken many “bold decisions” in her career to date, she has moved across sectors, seeking challenges on her journey.</p>
<h3 id="taking-risks">Taking risks</h3>
<p>Her trajectory through the typical ‘relationship-based’ female roles saw her emerge the other side into the world of technology. From here she has built a career within Citi “based on my skillset and my ability to bring people together and to deliver”.</p>
<p>However, even with progress to a senior level in the male-dominated technology sector, her determination to find the next big opportunity saw her move into cash management “and the rest is history”, she says. “Being bold, taking risks and thinking how each move can add to my skillset has helped bring me to where I am now.”</p>
<h3 id="to-plan-or-not">To plan or not?</h3>
<figure class="portrait right"><img alt="Portrait of Séverine Le Blévennec, listening to the Women in Treasury panel discussion" height="225" src="/i/2017/11/2017-11and12-tt-03-wit__severine-le-blevennec__200x225.jpg" style="float:left;margin-right:2em;margin-bottom:2em;" width="200"/></figure>
<p>Whether career planning is a good idea or not is debatable. For Hinden, it is a mistake to think too far ahead, setting a goal and ticking off the key elements one by one. “It is far more important to enjoy and learn from the job you are doing today or tomorrow,” she advises. Don’t dismiss an opportunity because it does not fit the traditional path and never get hung up on job titles, “they don’t matter”, she says.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly though, make a judgement on whether the job you take is with a group of people with which you will enjoy working. It’s very telling that Hinden says the only job she has had that she didn’t enjoy was where she didn’t get on with her boss. In the final analysis, “it’s all about the people you work with.”</p>
<p>But in saying this, Hinden is not talking about fitting in nicely “and playing golf”. It’s about finding a group of people “you can work with, laugh with and learn from”. The reason to do so is simple: “It’s about what we do now that counts, not what we will do in 15 years’ time.”</p>
<p>Indeed, people change, plans are altered, no one knows what the future holds. “If you’ve spent several years striving towards the end-goal of your perfect career with people you don’t like, you’ve wasted those years when you could have been having fun.”</p>
<h3 id="be-the-brand">Be the brand</h3>
<p>In forging ahead with a career, the concept of ‘personal brand’ has a role. Mur believes that the individual should “look promotable”. An organisation will have an image it wishes to convey; conveying that image is important for success. “Working for a large corporation is not necessarily about individuality; if you want to be an individual you become an entrepreneur,” she comments.</p>
<p>Another key to success for Mur is visibility. Being able to articulate your contribution to the organisation, in terms that are “meaningful for senior management”, is essential. “Have an ‘elevator pitch’ ready because you only have one opportunity to make a great first impression,” she advises.</p>
<p>To get to the right place, Hesse feels taking bold decisions and risks is vital. “There’s no point in sitting comfortably and complaining all the time. It’s up to you to take a decision to change,” she warns. With a number of diverse roles under her belt, she has taken every opportunity to progress. In fact, she sees progress as “life-long learning”, where the ability to adapt is key and the need to “invest to be successful” is clearly the right mindset.</p>
<figure class="portrait left"><img alt="Women networking during the drinks reception" height="208" src="/i/2017/11/2017-11and12-tt-03-wit__few-women-networking__625x208.jpg" width="625"/></figure>
<h3 id="a-helping-hand">A helping hand</h3>
<p>Having been exposed, through a British Council colleague, to the difficulties that vision problems can create in the workplace, Lay has experience of looking at life differently. Many of us have little appreciation of how our own working environments are serious challenges for those who are partially sighted or blind trying to navigate their working day. The need therefore is to try to “put the shoe on the other foot” for many different scenarios.</p>
<p>By looking at people in the workplace from a “human perspective” and recognising the challenges faced by so many, he believes empathy and greater tolerance are possible.</p>
<p>In career development mode, the capacity to understand what may be difficult circumstances for an individual, and to develop talent, is an essential part of encouraging diversity. Mentoring is one way of ensuring the best people are recognised, regardless of background.</p>
<p>“The key aspect of any successful mentorship is to be genuine and clear about the relationship objectives,” explains McIntosh. Choosing the right mentor is critical. “You have to have someone who is able to empathise with your situation and who is willing and able to listen to your needs.” Equally, the mentee must be ready for the process, she adds. They must recognise the need to invest time and effort and be prepared to listen to the mentor, especially if they hold different viewpoints, if they are to rise to senior levels.</p>
<p>Sponsorship is another form of encouragement of diversity. Hinden has positive experiences to relate, where she has been prepared and coached by a sponsor to take on new roles. “Having someone actively involved in your career can be extraordinarily beneficial,” she says. However, she warns, there is a downside, where it just becomes patronage of those of a similar background, “sidestepping real progression on merit” and potentially limiting the organisation’s diversity. Formal coaching, especially with peers, has proven a valuable career development tool for Hinden too. “It’s a good thing to take part in, from both sides,” she says. The honesty of the coaching environment often reveals clearer pathways to achieving goals, whilst being a great way for the coach to improve succinct thinking. “I don’t think there is any downside,” she opines.</p>
<p>These approaches often benefit from a proactive method, adds Mur. Anyone feeling uncertain about asking should know that managers often feel “flattered” to be asked for their advice and views. Adopting this approach is often the way to “build the best relationships”, allowing them to develop naturally but, Mur adds, “it really is up to you to initiate it”.</p>
<h3 id="building-for-self-and-for-all">Building for self and for all</h3>
<figure class="portrait right"><img alt="Woman asking question at the end of the Women in Treasury panel discussion" height="225" src="/i/2017/11/2017-11and12-tt-03-wit__woman-asking-question__200x225.jpg" style="float:left;margin-right:2em;margin-bottom:2em;" width="200"/>
</figure>
<p>In building teams for success, Lay believes companies should take time to celebrate the diversity within. Engaging in open discussion in this way lays the foundations for normalising any differences, ultimately making the team environment “a great leveler” in terms of development.</p>
<p>For the individual seeking progress, Hesse suggests using the human connections between teams, between functions, and even between entities, to build stronger ties and to better understand how the organisation works end-to-end. This serves to create a good business partner and, in doing so, will establish demand amongst the other units.</p>
<p>Add value and take responsibility, she further advises. “Get involved with the entire process but don’t be afraid to challenge the status quo. You can coach your bosses, helping them to change their set views so that they too can adapt to the new environment of diversity.”</p>
<p>“Always remember you have a choice about what you are doing,” comments Hinden. If you don’t like what you do, try and change it. “It can feel incredibly liberating to understand what has motivated you and what choices you have made to be where you are.” But she also advises people to steer clear of work places where there is no laughter “or where you can’t get a decent cup of tea”. The latter may be a personal requisite…</p>
<h3 id="believe-in-change">Believe in change</h3>
<p>To set out on any path first means to know what you want to achieve and to be clear about what you are good at, says McIntosh. Above all, she says, believe in and be true to yourself. “Everyone has the feeling sometime that they will be found out. But believe in yourself and, if you want the next job or the mentorship, just ask for it; the worst you can be told is no.”</p>
<p>To be an agent of change, “be the change you wish to see”, counsels Lay, paraphrasing Ghandi. “The only regrets people really have are when they have not been true to themselves.” In seeking diversity, there is an opportunity “for those in positions of responsibility to look out for people who are more vulnerable”. These people, he says, are in the workplace and they may not have the confidence or the capacity to articulate their needs. “We can all help others to flourish and enjoy their working life.”</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p><i>Treasury Today took its pioneering Women in Treasury Forum to New York for the second time last week. Here are some highlights from the day.</i></p>
<i></i><br/>
<p>On Thursday 12<sup>th</sup> October Treasury Today hosted the New York installation of our global Women in Treasury Forums. A fresh format with fantastic, energetic panellists and a gathering of impassioned corporate finance professionals in our audience created an electric atmosphere at The Pierre Hotel in Midtown.</p>
<br/>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a class="button--red-stroke" href="/women-in-treasury/2017/events/new-york/gallery">View gallery</a></p>
<br/>
<p>The Women in Treasury initiative was established to support, inspire and raise the profile of women in our industry. It now encompasses regular profiles of <a href="/category/women-in-treasury">women in our industry</a>, Forums across the world, our <a href="/women-in-treasury/2017/study">annual global study</a>, our <a href="/adamsmith/2017/winners/woty-winner-janet-m-gibbons">Woman of the Year Award</a> within our Adam Smith Awards programme recognising exceptional female achievement in treasury and our dedicated LinkedIn Women in Treasury community. Since its inception, the initiative has evolved to encompass a wider dialogue around diversity, inclusion and equal opportunity, and we are proud to be part of a movement that encourages and supports this essential progress.</p>
<p>Attendees from the worlds of treasury, technology and finance gathered in New York to network, share ideas and opinions derived from our 2017 Women in Treasury Global Study, the results of which were released earlier in October. They also came, of course, to hear from 2017’s panel. This was composed of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Susan Mercer</strong> – Vice President, Assistant Treasurer, Cargill, Incorporated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jenifer Herdin</strong> – Vice President, International Treasury, Viacom</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mary Gilbert</strong> – Treasury Manager, Duracell</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Karen Gilhooly</strong> – Executive Vice President, Global Liquidity and Cash Management, Head of Client Management – North America, HSBC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Eric Houser</strong> – Executive Vice President, Head of Technology, Media and Telecom Corporate Banking Group, Wells Fargo</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the course of the twelve months following our first Women in Treasury Forum in New York, we have seen worrying global political developments that have made the conversation around diversity and inclusion more important than ever.</p>
<p>The day began with a networking drinks reception and a speech from Meg Coates, Associate Publisher EMEA &amp; Americas, Treasury Today, who highlighted key findings from the 2017 <a href="/women-in-treasury/2017/study">Women in Treasury Global Study</a> which sits at the heart of the Women in Treasury initiative and maps the treasury profession’s path to diversity.</p>
<p>352 female corporates from across the world participated in the <a href="/women-in-treasury/2017/study">2017 Women in Treasury Global Study</a>. The subsequent panel discussion focused on some of the key themes raised by the respondents of this year’s study. Moderated by Sophie Jackson, Associate Group Publisher, Treasury Today Group, the conversation centred around what the terms diversity and inclusion really mean for a modern US audience.</p>
<p>The panel also addressed issues of visibility for women and minorities. Honing in on the specifics of corporate treasury and finance and highlighting the stumbling blocks to greater representation, the panel’s overwhelming tone was energetic and determined with many impactful calls to action for the audience to take away with them.</p>
<p>Takeaways for those in the room last Thursday were around the importance of speaking out and making the use of your voice and presence, taking and earning your seat at the table. There was also a passionate message around the importance of giving back to the next generation and pushing forward to create a better working future for all.</p>

<p>Commenting on the Women in Treasury initiative and the success of this most recent event, Meg Coates, Associate Publisher EMEA and Americas, said: “In a year full of political and economic turbulence and upheaval, it can sometimes feel like we have taken a step backwards. However, events such as this are part of a global movement, a steady march towards equality. Together we can continue to push diversity forward in the world of corporate treasury.”</p>
<p>Following the panel discussion, an energetic and enthusiastic question and answer session took place, with audience members keen to find out more about our panellist’s careers and the challenges they have faced and overcome.</p>
<p>Speaking about the success of this year’s panel, Sophie Jackson said: “I’m delighted at this, our second Women in Treasury Forum in New York, to see how far both our Women in Treasury initiative and the global dialogue around diversity and inclusion have come.”</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p><i>Diversity is not about hitting targets, it is about building a culture where everyone can thrive. This was a key takeaway from Treasury Today’s latest Women in Treasury Forum in London.</i></p>
<i></i><br/>
<div class="boxed right" id="insight-nav">
<p>2017 has been a hard year for global discussions of diversity and inclusion. Against this challenging political backdrop it can often feel like progress is either stagnant or in fact declining. However, the ever increasing success of programmes such as the Women in Treasury initiative are a testament to a gradual global movement towards equality and we must all be vigilant and ensure momentum is maintained.</p>
<p>This forward-looking ethos was highlighted at our latest and most groundbreaking Women in Treasury Forum in London last Thursday 14<sup>th</sup> September. The event was held at Plaisterers’ Hall in the City of London and attracted over 180 senior treasury professionals from the UK and Europe. Attendees came to network, learn from each other’s experiences, and hear from an inspirational line-up of senior industry speakers who shared their personal insights on a broad range of issues.</p>
<p>Over the five years that Treasury Today have been running the Women in Treasury initiative the dialogue has evolved to include diversity in all its forms and we have been delighted to observe the evolution of the conversation. The forums now take place across the world and the discussion has expanded to bring men into the fold and to discuss broader themes of diversity, inclusion and career development.</p>
<p>The 2017 London panel featured:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Cornelia Hesse</strong> – Head of Controlling, BASF Global Finance Shared Services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Frances Hinden</strong> – VP, Treasury Operations, Shell International Ltd</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sabine McIntosh</strong> – Managing Director, Global Head of Account Services, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Peter Lay</strong> – Head of Global Treasury, Oxfam</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deborah Mur</strong> – Head of Global Liquidity and Cash Management, HSBC France</p>
</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a class="button--red-stroke" href="/women-in-treasury/2017/events/london/gallery">View gallery</a></p>
<br/>
<h3 id="footsteps-to-follow">Footsteps to follow</h3>
<p>Central to the panel discussion was the idea that diversity and inclusion will only thrive once we begin to think in entirely new ways. This involves every one of us, both men and women, reassessing how we perceive the workplace. The stellar line-up of panellists were frank about their own experiences of prejudice but were also honest about the limitations of their own perceptions. Until we try to walk a mile in someone else’s shoes we will not truly understand their professional experience.</p>
<p>A lack of empathy and a willingness to step outside of our own experience can manifest itself in behaviours that can make people feel uncomfortable or see them overlooked for promotions. In the fast-paced world we live in, it can be easy to forget that those around us have their own internal and external struggles that may impact how they behave. Taking time to think about these is a great way to build empathy and understanding, both of which are key traits of diverse thinking.</p>
<p>The positive message was that each panellist promoted a theme of empathy and understanding. This, along with hard work and constant learning, will be our way forward.</p>
<p>Organisations can also help by building policies that promote diverse thinking, especially around hiring practices. The panel noted that all too often, managers hire people that reflect themselves or replicate the profile of previous high-performers. The result is exclusive hiring practices that do not promote diversity. Building policies that implement checks and balances around this may be a positive step to take to ensure more women and men who are overlooked for myriad reasons, receive the promotions they deserve.</p>
<h3 id="food-for-thought">Food for thought</h3>
<p>The purpose of Treasury Today’s Women in Treasury initiative is to inspire and generate debate. This year the forum in London certainly achieved these objectives.</p>
<p>“It takes energy and courage to drive change,” says Séverine Le Blévennec, Director EMEA Treasury at Honeywell. “The Women in Treasury Forum provides a great opportunity to chart the progress that has been made and ensure that our attention remains focused on driving diversity in the workplace.”</p>
<p>Karen Pugsley, Group Treasurer at Domino's Pizza Group said: “I have been involved in Women in Treasury since it first started. It is a great opportunity to network and hear the other perspectives of women in the industry.”</p>

<p>Commenting about the Women in Treasury initiative and the success of this most recent event, Meg Coates, Associate Publisher EMEA and Americas, said ‘Our pioneering Women in Treasury initiative was established to support, inspire and raise the profile of women in our industry.  Since its inception, the initiative has evolved to encompass a wider dialogue around diversity, inclusion and equal opportunity, and we are proud to be part of a movement that encourages and supports this essential progress. Together we can continue to push diversity forward in the world of corporate treasury.’</p>
<p>Following the panel discussion, a lively and enthusiastic question and answer session took place, with many questions and observations from the audience.  This gave the panel the opportunity to share further insights from their own careers and the challenges they have faced and overcome.</p>
<p>Speaking about the success of this year’s panel, Sophie Jackson said “I’m delighted at this, our fifth Women in Treasury Forum in London, to see how far both our Women in Treasury initiative and the global dialogue around diversity and inclusion have come.”</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p><i>In part two of this in-depth interview with Mary Gilbert, Treasury Manager for The Duracell Company, she explains where her drive for success comes from and offers some salient points for others looking to follow in her footsteps.</i></p>
<h4>Do you think companies generally make the best use of talent?</h4>
<p>Recognising and developing the talent within a business is key to its success. Sometimes the talent is just not there and you have to go outside of the organisation. But sometimes the company culture can restrict individuals to certain roles, not seeing that they may be well-versed in other areas, and possibly overlooking them for different opportunities. If companies do not adapt to changing times, and fail to acknowledge that, for example, women can and do become experts in specialist fields, they will miss out on major talent.</p>
<h4>Much of your career progress has been achieved under your own steam. Where does your determination come from?</h4>
<p>I’d like to be seen as a driven individual. If I know there is something fundamentally lacking in the way I perform, I am one of those people who will always do something about it.</p>
<p>I grew up in inner-city Chicago, and not in the best neighbourhood. Opportunities were never just handed to you. I was only the third person in my family, after my father and brother, to get my High School Diploma, and I was the first to graduate and to earn a Masters, so this was a big accomplishment.</p>
<p>Something that I have always told myself is that if I want to be the best person I can be, I need to learn from my mistakes, adjust and make the best of every situation. So, if I’m in one of the worst schools in the City of Chicago and not learning the fundamentals from my instructors, then the best thing I can do is head to the library and teach myself. It has always been my mindset to think outside the box to get to where I need to be.</p>
<p>I don’t have a favourite quote from anyone else that I abide by to spur me on. But for myself – and I advise this to other people – I always say know your role and the power it holds, but also understand your own special energy or magic, your own ability, your true worth and your potential. It’s too easy to break the spirit of those who lack that self-belief. But if you hold true to your values, and you know you have the potential to be great, it is very hard for anyone to tell you that you can’t be.</p>
<p>There is a dividing line between confidence and arrogance, but confidence is key in achieving your goals. I take that message and employ it across all aspects of my life, not just my career.</p>
<h4>Did you have to fight for the Duracell role?</h4>
<p>It wasn’t dropped into my lap but my positive LinkedIn profile led someone to point me in the direction of the job. Initially, I thought it was not for me; it would have been more convenient to stay where I was. But the opportunities within Duracell, as a Berkshire Hathaway company, are almost endless. So I seized the moment.</p>
<p>At Duracell, I am learning a ton; I just eat it up! I love being put in new situations and being instrumental in starting projects from the ground up. Whereas before I was working in an already established organisation and hedging program, I can now experience the satisfaction of ownership myself. Along with my goals, these experiences will help me with my career plan to become treasurer, and maybe CFO.</p>
<h4>As you move up the career ladder, what advice would you give to junior colleagues following in your footsteps?</h4>
<p>Learn from your mistakes. At times, we get discouraged when we slip up, and then think ‘maybe this is not the right career path for me’. I say stay steadfast in your career path. If it is the one you wish to follow, be sure to use every opportunity and absorb as much information as possible. The more well-versed you are, the more opportunities there will be. I could have become an expert in FX but that would have put me in a box and meant not being able to experience the many other facets of treasury.</p>
<p>I encourage people to find someone within their organisation that they respect and then home in on what makes them great. Once you understand those qualities, try to develop those which you are lacking and can develop. Something I have had to learn was being open to criticism. If someone critiques you, don’t automatically perceive it as a way of putting you down; not everyone in your career is trying to do this – most want you to do well. If you own those critiques and work on them, you will go far.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p><em>With her insatiable quest for knowledge and steely determination, Mary Gilbert, Treasury Manager for The Duracell Company, is an inspiration to all. In part one of this exclusive interview, she tells Treasury Today about her long journey from one side of town to the other.</em></p>
<p>The Midwestern metropolis of Chicago is a key international hub for finance, commerce, industry, technology, telecommunications and transportation. It is also a divided city and for those on the wrong side of the tracks, something special is needed to make an impact.</p>
<p>For Mary Gilbert, it has been a long journey to arrive at her current position as Treasury Manager of The Duracell Company.  However, she has always possessed that “something special” needed to make things happen.</p>
<p>For Mary, learning is a lifelong quest. She is an alumnus of Northern Illinois University, and the Keller Graduate School of Management of DeVry University. Her formal education is just a part of what makes her successful.</p>
<h4>Tell us about your early career and move into treasury.</h4>
<p>I was not initially driven towards treasury. In college, my learning was focused in the areas of financial auditing and accounting, and my degree of studies reflected this interest. When I graduated in 2007, I moved into commercial banking. After a while, it was clear that my skills and interests would be better served elsewhere, and so I went back to University. Heading for grad school meant having to pick a clear pathway. The banking experience steered me towards the needs of corporate America and a Masters in Forensic Accounting and Financial Management.</p>
<p>The job that followed in 2011 – Treasury Analyst at multinational network infrastructure provider, CommScope – was a natural progression for me. Even if by that point I had not yet decided to make treasury my home, it was a foot in the door so that I could at least make an informed choice once on the inside.</p>
<p>Within CommScope, my line manager, the FX Risk Manager, Blair McCaleb, became my mentor. She had started as a Treasury Analyst and has since worked up to Director of Treasury. During the five years I was with the company, I watched her become a true leader in the organisation. With Blair as my manager, and the Treasury Director at the time also a woman, I had the pleasure of seeing women being valued and recognised in the workplace.</p>
<p>As a Treasury Analyst, I was handling international and domestic cash management. When Blair announced she was pregnant, the company knew of my ambition and wanted me to learn the FX balance sheet hedging programme she had established. With less than eight months to pick it up, I was a little nervous. But under Blair’s tutelage, I figured out what was involved and was up to speed in less than six months.</p>
<p>When Blair went on maternity leave, I took on the position for the duration. In doing so, I found something I was passionate about. I know not everyone in treasury has the same interest with FX but it was something that absolutely intrigued me. I loved diving into the intricacies of currency movements and their impact on the business. Although I also enjoyed and discovered that I was good at accounting, auditing and uncovering financial anomalies and I even wondered if I should go back to school to pursue a Certified Public Accountants certificate, it just wasn’t where my passion lay. From that moment on, I knew the treasury world was where I wanted to be.</p>
<h4>You seize opportunities as they arise; do you set yourself targets for achievement?</h4>
<p>I have always set personal goals for my life and my career. One of the things that I desired was to reach management level within six years of starting my career. I had to be honest and question if I was going to reach that goal within the CommScope organisation.</p>
<p>Some say my goals are ambitious but I try my best to meet the goals that I have set and my philosophy has always been to keep learning everything I can to achieve them. At CommScope I had the opportunity, through colleagues, to learn as much about treasury and areas of the business that I did not know and I seized every one as a means of reaching my goal.</p>

<h5>Tell us about your career path – why treasury?</h5>
<p>Banking and finance have always been in my blood as my father was a Senior Banker in the UAE. I decided to follow a similar path and qualified as a Chartered Accountant. I began my career as an accountant with PwC before moving to work as a Private Banker at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>Within three years, I decided that I needed to do something different. Banking was not giving me the satisfaction I was seeking. The target-oriented nature of the profession did not suit my way of working and did not interest me professionally.</p>
<p>Corporate treasury was the best fit with my accountancy and banking background. However, at this point, the profession was in its nascent stages in the UAE. Few ‘pure treasury’ jobs existed, especially as most foreign organisations ran treasury in the UAE from Europe or America.</p>
<p>However, there were lots of trade finance and FX risk management roles available with local oil companies. My first treasury role was with an oil trading firm as a Treasury Analyst, working on the commodity hedging and trade finance side of the business. I later moved to an Omani listed marine business which was going through its IPO listing process, working primarily in corporate finance.</p>
<p>The opportunity to broaden my geographical remit – and establish a regional treasury at National Oilwell Varco – was too good to turn down. I joined the company in 2013 and have not looked back since.</p>
<h5>What challenges have you encountered climbing the career ladder and how were these overcome?</h5>
<p>Personally, like many women, it has been tough balancing home and work. I am lucky that I have a great social support system and my family to help me take care of my children, enabling me to focus on my job.</p>
<p>I never took up flexi working or sabbaticals when my children were born. I wanted to fast-track my career growth and did not want to be ‘left behind’. I have seen biases in the region where women are unfairly penalised for doing so.</p>
<p>This was not an easy decision but I believe my children will understand and be inspired by my ability to multitask and appreciate the fact that the time I spend with family is quality time.</p>
<p>On the professional front, the biggest challenge early in my career was working for difficult and aggressive bosses, who were not willing to give the recognition deserved, or help you move forward in your career. There was a sense of insecurity amongst many in the organisation and as a result, juniors moving up the ranks were often perceived as “threatening”. This was mainly because many women had to prove that they could take up the same amount or even higher responsibilities despite having families.</p>
<p>I think that this dynamic has changed in recent years. I personally am very conscious of ensuring that my team get the credit and recognition they deserve and NOV is a great organisation in providing a dynamic and independent work environment with no gender bias. I also ensure that any bankers that we work with that do a good job also get recognition as I know what a tough industry it can be.</p>
<p>The positive side of working in challenging environments is that the learning curve is quite steep and accelerated. Eventually I consider every experience that I gained as an opportunity for further learning.</p>
<h5>Have you had mentors in your career and if so how important have these been in aiding your career progression?</h5>
<p>I have been very fortunate to work for some great people who have brought out the best in me.</p>
<p>In my current organisation, the Treasurer and the Finance Director have been my key mentors. They provide invaluable advice in terms of the way I should approach issues, challenging and coaching me to be successful not only in my current role but as a well-rounded resource to the organisation.</p>
<p>I am also inspired by my mother and mother-in-law too. They are superwomen in their respective fields, juggling great careers and family so effectively.</p>
<h5>What is your motto in life?</h5>
<p>Be human. Understand and empathise with situations and people that work with you and ensure positivity and better interpersonal relationships.</p>
<p>I respect knowledge and skills that are acquired through formal education and experience. However, intangibles like right attitude towards work and people, positivity, self-motivation and team spirit, fuel creativity and better productivity in the workplace. I strongly believe that emotional intelligence is a proven differentiator in the competitive climb up the corporate ladder.</p>
<h5>If there is one thing you would have done differently in your career path, what would that be?</h5>
<p>I believe that experience is the best teacher. I wish that I had taken more advantage of opportunities afforded to me to travel and work overseas earlier in my career.</p>
<p>However, I have no regrets and I plan to do this going forward. I aim to one day run a global treasury operation, based in one of the world’s top financial centres.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>Over the five years that the Treasury Today Group have been running our Women in Treasury initiative, it has been interesting to see how conversations around diversity have evolved. In a relatively short time, diversity has shifted from a fringe topic to one at the heart of corporate life.</em></p>
<p>What is equally important is that the focus of these conversations has also shifted beyond the topic of gender diversity to focus on a much broader range of issues. These conversations are helping to create a more holistic view of what it means to have a diverse corporate culture.</p>
<p>There are many drivers behind this evolution, perhaps most crucial is the correlation between diversity and improved business performance. Numerous studies have highlighted this, such as McKinsey’s 2015 ‘Why Diversity Matters’ report, which found that companies in the top quartile for gender or racial and ethnic diversity are more likely to have financial returns above their national industry medians. Those in the bottom quartile in these dimensions are statistically less likely to achieve above-average returns.</p>
<p>A more recent paper from the Peterson Institute for International Economics came to similar conclusions. It found through the analysis of 21,980 firms from 91 countries that the presence of women in corporate leadership positions improves financial performance.</p>
<p>The journey to equality is not all about numbers and hitting targets. Diversity is the by-product of an inclusive workplace, diversity is what you have and inclusion is how you act. An inclusive workplace is one that welcomes diversity by creating an environment where different kinds of people can thrive and succeed.</p>
<h3 id="diversity-in-dialogue">Diversity in dialogue</h3>
<p>As conversations around diversity in the workplace evolve, so too must our Women in Treasury initiative. The ways that businesses can create an inclusive environment and the need for continued promotion of diversity in the workplace were just two of the topics discussed at the most recent Women in Treasury Asia Forum, held at Singapore’s Four Seasons Hotel in April.</p>
<img alt="Man asking question during forum" height="225" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/singapore-2017/2017-05-06-tta-03-wit-asia-man-asking-question-301-200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=E0D947313E3AAE04BF0D5C9222344E30" style="float:left;margin:0 2em 2em 0;" width="200">
<p>Now in its fifth year, our global initiative continues to gain momentum and is playing a pivotal role celebrating and promoting inclusion in the corporate finance space. This was highlighted by the presence of over 120 senior financial professionals, both male and female, from across the region who came together to network and learn from each other’s experiences. The panel has broadened this year to welcome our first male panellist, Manoj Dugar, Managing Director and Product Head for Core Cash, Asia Pacific Treasury Services, J.P. Morgan, who offered his perspective on the shifting dialogue as well as showcasing how male allies can support and effect change within their organisations.</p>
<p>The day began with a networking session before an introduction from Sophie Jackson, Associate Group Publisher. Then, James Hayward, Associate Editor at Treasury Today Asia discussed some of the key findings from the most recent Women in Treasury Global Study.</p>
<p>Following this, our guests went through for lunch and were then treated to an all-star panel discussion featuring four leading industry speakers, all of whom are enjoying extraordinary careers.</p>
<p>This year’s panel included:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Felicia Foong</strong>, Regional Treasurer, Nestle</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bonnie Yang</strong>, Treasury Director, Alibaba</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manoj Dugar</strong>, Managing Director and Product Head for Core Cash, Asia Pacific Treasury Services, J.P. Morgan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Toni Weber</strong>, Group Finance Director, interTouch</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sophie Jackson facilitated the dynamic and lively debate, which was defined by the open and honest views of the panel.</p>
<h3 id="journeys-to-the-top">Journeys to the top</h3>
<p>The panel session began with an exploration of the panellists’ careers in corporate finance, the journeys they have taken and the opportunities and challenges they have encountered along the way, with Manoj Dugar of J.P. Morgan highlighting the socio-cultural evolution he has seen over his 20 year banking career and how the dialogue has expanded to include discussions of racial and cultural backgrounds as well as sexuality alongside gender equality.</p>
<p>Although each panellist has followed a very different path to their current role, one thing bound them all: they had all made bold changes at some stage, be that changing role, industry, location or a combination of all three. Toni Weber, for instance, shared her decision to move from the UK, where she worked in a traditional accounting role, to Darwin, Australia. “This role saw me leave my pinstripes behind and get into scruffy clothes and go into the outback to audit aboriginal communities,” she explains. She admitted that this wasn’t an easy decision to make and joked that even most Australians that she knows haven’t been to the Northern Territories.</p>
<img alt="Woman networking" height="225" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/singapore-2017/2017-05-06-tta-03-wit-asia-sonia-clifton-bligh-133-200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=CB91D097AA984331E0DF1C426D6B3C7A" style="float:right;margin:0 0 2em 2em;" width="200"/>
<p>She was encouraged by her boss at the time though, who acted as an informal mentor and gave her the confidence to take this big step. “This move then gave me the confidence to keep pursuing different challenges and afterwards I moved to Paris, Amsterdam and then to China, which was completely outside of my comfort zone,” she says.</p>
<p>Felica Foong had similar experiences pushing herself outside of her comfort zone by taking on different roles within finance in countries in Europe and Asia. However, she admitted that not everyone can be mobile all the time – even if they would like to think that they are. Early on in her career, for example, she had specific career plans and opportunities to move overseas but that did not take place, before she finally moved to Hong Kong and then Switzerland. “Moving overseas often sounds like a good idea, but you will need a supportive family behind your decision,” she says. “One day you might be mobile and the next day you might not.”</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>She did encourage those in the audience though who hadn’t moved overseas in their career to do so at some stage. “Being mobile has opened up new career opportunities for me,” she says. “It has also enriched my personal life and that of my family. Yes, there is a steep learning curve professionally and culturally, but if it is something that you want to do then take charge of your career and do so.”</p>
<h3 id="external-encouragement">External encouragement</h3>
<p>What is interesting in both of their accounts is that these brave steps were not made in isolation. Support from mentors, organisations, friends or spouses was crucial in helping them make their decisions. Indeed the role that mentoring, either official or unofficial, has played in their career development reflected the responses to our 2016 Women in Treasury Global Study, with 99% of respondents stating that mentoring is either very important or important.</p>
<p>Having a mentor that pushes you is not only important when looking to move overseas, they can also be important when you are looking to move industries. Bonnie Yang relayed this when discussing her transition from the world of banking to corporate treasury. “I had worked in banks for many years in numerous positions and really enjoyed my work,” she explains. “Some part of me always wanted to try new things, however, and I was told about the position at Alibaba by a friend who worked in corporate treasury. I must admit that I wasn’t sure at first about applying for the role, but my friend encouraged me to do so. After two years now in the role at Alibaba, I am very happy and glad that I made the decision to move to the corporate world.”</p>
<img alt="Woman asking question during forum" height="225" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/singapore-2017/2017-05-06-tta-03-wit-asia-woman-asking-question-270-200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=2CEB60C5A79BF0532C6E701E28A7CF68" style="float:left;margin:0 2em 2em 0;" width="200"/>
<p>Bonnie was also supported by a mentoring arrangement upon joining Alibaba. “Every newcomer to the business gets a mentor,” says Bonnie. “They are there to help you navigate what is quite a complex business and ensure that you settle down quickly. I personally found this support extremely helpful.”</p>
<p>From this there was interesting debate around the types of mentoring that our panellists found to be the most productive. Felicia, for example, discussed her experiences as a mentor in a structured programme. “Mentoring works, but in my personal experience, structured mentoring programmes are not the most effective,” she says. “For instance, in my previous career, I was made a mentor at work and assigned a member of staff to coach. It went well to begin with and it faded away towards the end of the programme and we didn’t keep in touch. In another instance, someone approached me to be his mentor, a more organic arrangement. It is more spontaneous, there is chemistry, he feels that he can benefit from mycoaching and insights and I believe that I can add value to him, both contribute and have accountability over the relationship. I believe it can have a more positive impact.”</p>
<p>All panellists agreed though that their experience of being a mentor had helped them learn more about themselves, claiming that mentoring arrangements should ultimately be a positive experience for both mentor and mentee.</p>
<h3 id="culture-change">Culture change</h3>
<p>As a senior leader in one of the world’s largest banks, Manoj Dugar offered some strong insight into the importance of creating diverse teams. Most notably he shared his fundamental belief that diverse and inclusive teams make better decisions, sharing his own efforts to make sure his team was diverse.</p>
<p>However, it takes more than one person to change a system and Manoj was keen to highlight that, across the board, attitudes and practices need to change, especially given the shifting sands of our modern cultural landscape.</p>
<p>Creating an inclusive environment is not easy though, and there are many obstacles that stand in the way. Manoj cited the most challenging of these is the need to abolish myths around gender roles and even go beyond thinking about gender at all; hiring people based purely on their skillsets as race, gender and age become irrelevant.</p>
<img alt="Man networking before the forum" height="225" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/singapore-2017/2017-05-06-tta-03-wit-asia-man-networking-154-200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=438435DCE63971D642D85016BF414E15" style="float:right;margin:0 0 2em 2em;" width="200"/>
<p>Toni shared her experiences throughout her career of overcoming such cultural challenges and breaking down barriers. She explained how early in her career she was prevented from being given a promotion because management found out that she was a woman, having presumed when reading her name initially that she was male. She also faced issues when working in China with problems around her taking on the CFO role. “It was mistakenly and short-sightedly assumed by the male CEO of the business that having a female CFO would cause him a loss of face in front of his Chinese partners,” says Toni.</p>
<p>Gender inequality and enforced stereotypes impact men as well as women. Manoj talked about how men who decide to stay at home and become primary caregivers for their children may often face judgement and feel insecure about their choice in erring from the stereotypical male role of breadwinner. When women choose not to take on the role of primary caregiver they can feel guilt and when men are not fulfilling the traditional role of breadwinner they can feel shame and to remove this we must dissolve any idea of designated gender roles. “There might need to be a family revolution, or human revolution to achieve this and ensure an environment where everybody can make respected choices,” said Manoj.</p>
<h3 id="the-next-generation">The next generation</h3>
<p>What is clear is that businesses will need to change. The whole panel agreed that millennials are bringing a new way of thinking into businesses and disrupting traditional ways of working. The need therefore to build an inclusive workplace that welcomes people from different backgrounds, with different skillsets and experiences, is now a must.</p>
<p>Each individual on the panel is experiencing this shift in different ways. Manoj, for instance, highlighted his decision to take a much younger ‘tech-savvy’ colleague to a meeting in order to hear his perspective on the customer’s business. Upon arrival at the meeting, he realised that the client had also brought a similar colleague to attend from their side! Having the two of them there, he said, enabled the conversation to be dynamic, with new ideas brought to the table.</p>
<p>Bonnie, having moved from banking to a huge technology company that has a start-up attitude, had some interesting comments on this new way of working. “It was not an easy transition,” she says. “Everything is exciting, but different, from employees’ mindset, pace of work and how decisions are made. It is a culture that Alibaba fosters and by working with so many incredibly talented young people it makes you feel young again.”</p>
<h3 id="views-from-the-floor">Views from the floor</h3>
<p>The purpose of Treasury Today Asia’s Women in Treasury initiative is to inspire and to generate debate. This year our new format Asia Forum certainly achieved both of these objectives.</p>
<p>Speaking after the panel discussion, Kemmy Koh, Group CFO at Chinese Global Investors Group said that she agreed with the panel in that there has been a developed discussion around diversity and inclusion in recent years. “This has become more apparent as more millennials join the workforce and more women take up senior leadership roles,” she says.</p>
<p>That being said, Kemmy believes that there is more that can be done to tackle inequality in the workplace. “This includes allowing flexible working, introducing mentoring programmes that help women reach senior roles, reviewing the promotion selection and monitoring and measuring promotion rates and also having more female focused networking events.”</p>
<img alt="Woman networking before the forum" height="225" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/singapore-2017/2017-05-06-tta-03-wit-asia-woman-smiling-152-200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=8C4A45596AB3554E3E569A0C3EAF4F81" style="float:left;margin:0 2em 2em 0;" width="200"/>
<p>Sonia Clifton-Bligh, Director, Regional Treasury Services Centre ASPAC at Johnson &amp; Johnson also felt that the debate had shifted in recent years. “Initially there was a lot of talk around gender and racial diversity, but now this has broadened to encompass more groups, such as persons with specific political or religious affiliation, sexual orientation, disabilities, or indigenous people as well as multi-generational workforces. I think organisations see the value in having people from different backgrounds with different perspectives and that it facilitates more robust decision making. Companies are therefore putting in more effort in promoting diversity and inclusion, to increase visibility to the under-represented groups, as a result.”</p>
<p>That being so, for now, initiatives such as Women in Treasury remain necessary. As Jennifer Leong, Treasury Director – Asia Pacific, Corporate Treasury at Cummins outlines: “The debate around diversity is starting to get more attention and forums such as this are a great avenue, especially for women, to get together and network, share experiences and learn to build up the treasury community and support the drive for greater diversity and inclusion in the corporate world.”</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p><em>In a relatively short time, Kate Moorcroft, Group Treasurer at Barratt Developments has risen to the top of the treasury profession.  In this candid interview, she talks about her career path and how learning to have confidence in her own abilities has enabled her to push forward her career.</em></p>
<em></em><br/>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Kate Moorcroft</h4>
<h5 class="title">Group Treasurer</h5>
<br/>
<img alt="Barratt Developments Plc logo" class="logo org" height="55" src="/i/logo/barratt-developments-plc-logo-2017-84x55.png" title="Barratt Developments Plc" width="84"><br/>
<p>Kate Moorcroft started her treasury career at Coventry Building Society in 2002 as a treasury trainee and worked up through the ranks before being promoted to Senior Dealer in 2008. In 2010 she was offered the opportunity to move from a financial organisation to a corporate and joined National Express as a Treasury Manager. During the six years Kate spent at National Express, she was promoted to the role of Assistant Treasurer and then finally Deputy Group Treasurer where she managed a small team and lead various international projects. Kate now holds the position of Group Treasurer at Barratt Developments.</p>
</img></div>
<h5 id="what-is-the-best-piece-of-advice-that-you-have-been-given-in-your-career-so-far">What is the best piece of advice that you have been given in your career so far?</h5>
<p>Believe in yourself, trust in your abilities and have confidence that you can do a good job. This wasn’t advice in its traditional sense, but more something that my boss at National Express instilled in me during my time working there.</p>
<p>When I first joined the company, I wasn’t the most self-confident person and would often be unwilling to push myself out of my comfort zone. But thankfully my boss invested in my development and handed me projects that pushed me. This enabled me to prove to myself that I could achieve more than I thought.</p>
<p>One of my biggest learnings has been that it is OK to ask questions and having the confidence to do so. Not knowing everything is OK, it is not a sign of weakness, and asking questions is actually a great way to learn from people and build up your own personal knowledge base.</p>
<h5 id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-women-in-finance-in-terms-of-establishing-and-developing-a-career">What advice would you give to women in finance in terms of establishing and developing a career?</h5>
<p>Don’t differentiate yourself from men. I believe that in financial roles, women can do just as good a job as men – it is just about believing in yourself.</p>
<p>Linked to this, I also think it is important that women put themselves forward for roles and become more visible in the industry. I understand that this is not always a simple thing to do and quite often women can have a tendency to focus too much on the things they cannot do rather than the great things they can do. But there are lots of women in treasury doing fantastic jobs and I think that should be celebrated rather than hidden away.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I have seen this happening more and more over the last ten years. For instance, when I first started going to treasury events there were very few women and it could be quite intimidating. Today there are a lot more women at conferences, speaking and making their voices heard.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-your-motto-in-life">What is your motto in life?</h5>
<p>I don’t have a particular motto, but I do believe in living life to its fullest. To do this you need to have a job that you love – and I am lucky to have this. It also requires a well-defined work/life balance to spend time doing what you enjoy outside of work.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-your-next-major-objective">What is your next major objective?</h5>
<p>Having just assumed the role of Group Treasurer at a FTSE 100 company, I sometimes have to pinch myself that I have come so far in my career. I am therefore just taking each day as it comes, immersing myself in the business, continuing to learn in order to become a better treasurer and leader and proving to myself that I can do a good job as a Group Treasurer.</p></div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>“I didn’t get into treasury the conventional way,” admits Kate Moorcroft, Group Treasurer at Barratt Developments when asked about her career path. Indeed, Kate is quite unusual in that she has climbed to the very top of the corporate treasury career ladder without a degree. “After finishing college, I really wasn’t sure what I wanted to do,” she says. “I therefore worked part-time as a bank cashier with Coventry Building Society and then went full time once I turned 18.”</p>
<p>Kate quickly rose through the ranks at the Coventry Building Society, with the next step in her career becoming a branch manager at 21. “I realised though that this wasn’t something that I wanted to do for the rest of my life,” says Kate. “Around the same time a treasury trainee job came up internally and it caught my interest despite not having any clue about what the treasury department did.”</p>
<p>After spending half a day in the department, Kate was intrigued and realised that it was a role that could enable her to build the career that she was looking for. “I decided to go for it and managed to get the role,” she explains. “I spent a year or so learning the ropes of the front, middle and back office.” The rest, as they say, is history.</p>
<h3 id="moving-forward">Moving forward</h3>
<p>After nine years working in treasury at Coventry Building Society, Kate decided that she wanted to broaden her experience and left to join National Express as a Treasury Manager. She admits that this wasn’t an easy decision to make given that she was very happy and comfortable in her role.</p>
<p>“In hindsight, throwing myself out of my comfort zone at Coventry Building Society was important,” explains Kate. “At that point in my career, I lacked self-confidence and was reluctant to push myself further.” Kate says that she couldn’t have moved to a better company than National Express, finding a boss who saw the potential in her and was willing to act as a mentor to bring this out.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote>I try to instil confidence in my team and get them to push themselves, just as others have done to me previously.</blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source"></p>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>“Very quickly at National Express I was being given projects that put me out of my comfort zone,” explains Kate. “At that time, I still approached these tasks with limited confidence but I still ended up doing a good job. Slowly I convinced myself that I could do more than I thought I could.” Kate was rewarded for this work with two promotions in six years, rising to the role of Deputy Treasurer at National Express before moving to her current role as Group Treasurer of Barratt Developments. “When I first started in treasury I never thought I would get to a deputy level, let alone group level, if I am honest.”</p>
<h3 id="drive-and-ambition">Drive and ambition</h3>
<p>When asked if not having a degree ever impacted her career, Kate answers that it has never really been an issue. “I passed the ACT exams just after moving to National Express and I think this, tied with my experience, outweighed having a degree and proved I was serious about treasury,” she says. Kate also notes that not having a degree has spurred her on to achieve more than she might have otherwise. “I would try to shadow my bosses and sit in on meetings, even when I didn’t fully understand the content, to build up my treasury skill set and see how people at a higher level operated.”</p>
<p>Now, as the leader of a treasury department, Kate feels it is incumbent on her to bring through the next generation of treasury professionals. “I try to instil confidence in my team and get them to push themselves, just as others have done to me previously,” she explains. “But as a leader, I also want to show that it is OK not to know everything. My team at Barratt have been with the company longer than I have and understand the business very well. I am therefore not afraid to say that I don’t understand something and ask them. Just because you are the boss, it doesn’t mean you know everything.”</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p><i>Treasury Today Asia’s latest Women in Treasury Forum in Singapore shone a spotlight on all the work that has been done to drive diversity for corporate finance professionals in the region. As our initiative broadens, practical advice on career development and on the direction the dialogue should take was at the centre of the debate.</i></p>
<i></i><br/>
<p>As conversations around diversity in the workplace evolve, so too must Treasury Today Group’s Women in Treasury initiative. Now in its fifth year, our global initiative continues to gain momentum and has expanded to include a US installation of our Forum and is playing a pivotal role celebrating and promoting inclusion in the treasury space.</p>
<p>This was highlighted at our most recent Women in Treasury Asia Forum, last Thursday April 6<sup>th</sup> in Singapore, where conversation focused on the need for continued promotion of gender diversity in the workplace, whilst broadening the debate to highlight the business imperative to create an inclusive environment for all people.</p>
<p>The event, held at Singapore’s Four Seasons Hotel was attended by over 120 senior financial professionals, both male and female, from across the region and saw guests come together to network and learn from each other’s experiences. The highlight of the day was the all-star panel discussion featuring four leading industry speakers, all of whom are enjoying extraordinary careers.</p>
<p>This year’s panel included:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Felicia Foong</strong>, Regional Treasurer, Nestle</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bonnie Yang</strong>, Treasury Director, Alibaba</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manoj Dugar</strong>, Managing Director and Product Head for Core Cash, Asia Pacific Treasury Services, J.P. Morgan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Toni Weber</strong>, Group Finance Director, interTouch</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sophie Jackson, Associate Group Publisher at Treasury Today Asia, facilitated the dynamic and lively debate, which was defined by the open and honest views of the panel.</p>
<h3 id="memorable-highlights">Memorable highlights</h3>
<p>The panel session began with an interesting exploration of the panellists’ careers in corporate finance, the journeys they have taken and the experiences and challenges they have encountered along the way. Although each panellist had very different paths to their current role, one thing bound them all: they had all made bold moves at some stage, be that in changing role, industry, location or a combination of all three.</p>
<p>These decisions ranged from moving abroad to pursue new opportunities – including Toni Weber leaving London to audit aboriginal communities in Darwin, Australia; making it clear to their employers the direction in which they wanted their career to move in and remaining firm on this; to throwing themselves out of their comfort zone completely by taking on daunting tasks and roles that they were unfamiliar with.</p>
<p>For all of the panellists, these brave steps were not made in isolation and all cited having strong support from their mentors, organisations, friends or spouses and these being vital in helping them get to where they are today. The role that mentoring, either official or unofficial, has played in their career development reflected the responses to our 2016 Women in Treasury Global Study which highlighted that 99% of respondents believe that mentoring is either very important or important.</p>
<p>There was interesting debate around the types of mentoring that our panellists found to be the most productive, with structured mentoring programmes seen as being perhaps a little less effective than more organic arrangements. It was also interesting to note that the panellists felt that their experience of being a mentor had helped them learn more about themselves, claiming that mentoring arrangements should ultimately be a positive experience for both mentor and mentee.</p>
<p>Another dynamic topic was the discussion around mobility and the challenges associated with moving overseas to progress your career. At some stage, all those on the panel had moved overseas and they recognised this as being one of the most important decisions they had made, both professionally and personally. Despite their own positive experiences, they were acutely aware of the challenges associated with moving overseas and that whilst most young professionals will say they are mobile, the reality can sometimes be very different.</p>
<p>The shifting sands of our modern cultural landscape also emerged as central to the developing dialogue. The panel agreed that millennials are bringing a new way of thinking into businesses and disrupting traditional ways of working. The need therefore to build an inclusive workplace that welcomes people from different backgrounds, with different skillsets and experiences is now a must.</p>
<p>Creating such an environment is not easy though, and there are many obstacles that stand in the way. The panel cited the most challenging of these is the need to abolish myths around gender roles and even go beyond thinking about gender at all; hiring people based purely on their skillsets as race, gender and age become irrelevant. This is a future we cannot deliver just within the corporate finance industry but one which will require a great social and cultural shift, perhaps even a revolution.</p>
<h3 id="an-inspiring-day">An inspiring day</h3>
<p>The purpose of Treasury Today Asia’s Women in Treasury initiative is to inspire and generate debate. This year the forum in Asia certainly achieved both of these objectives.</p>
<p>Commenting on the day Jennifer Leong, Treasury Director – Asia Pacific, Corporate Treasury at Cummins said: “The debate around diversity is starting to get more attention and forums such as this are a great avenue, especially for women, to get together and network, share experiences and learn to build up the treasury community and support the drive for greater diversity and inclusion in the corporate world.”</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p><em>Treasury and finance professionals come together in New York to celebrate and champion diversity at the first US installation of the Treasury Today Women in Treasury Forum.</em></p>
On Thursday 6<sup>th</sup> October 2016 over 130 senior financial professionals from across the US gathered in Midtown, Manhattan to celebrate diversity in the corporate treasury community at the inaugural US Treasury Today Women in Treasury Forum.
<p>The Women in Treasury Forum was held at the sharp Intercontinental Barclay in the heart of Midtown. Featuring a superb line-up of industry leaders, our panellists were:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Anita Prasad</strong>, Treasurer, Microsoft.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Maeve Robinson</strong>, Assistant Treasurer, Omnicom Group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Diane S. Reyes</strong>, Group General Manager, Global Head of Global Liquidity and Cash Management, HSBC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Diane Schumaker-Krieg</strong>, Managing Director, Global Head of Research, Economics and Strategy, Wells Fargo.</p>
<p> </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The panel discussion was facilitated by Sophie Jackson, Associate Group Publisher at Treasury Today. The panellists shared valuable and personal insight on issues affecting many women and men working in our industry, whilst also offering decisive tips and practical advice for those in attendance.</p>
<p>Speaking about the success of this year’s panel, Sophie Jackson said, “It was an honour to be involved with bringing our Women in Treasury Forum to the US for the first time. Moderating such an accomplished panel from different industry sectors was a real privilege and we look forward to further developing our US platform.”</p>
<p>The discussion, defined by the open and honest views of the speakers, offered many thoughtful insights into gender diversity in the US and globally, the progress that is being made and what more needs to be done. The varied and complementary backgrounds and professional achievements of the four women on stage inspired a broad spectrum of ideas and experiences which were shared with the audience.</p>
<h3 id="raise-your-profile">Raise your profile</h3>
<p>Diane Reyes was the first to speak taking the topic, ‘Career progression – how to get ahead’. Reyes offered some very useful, practical advice centred around the following five tips; The first was know your elevator pitch: Reyes stated that you must always be prepared to highlight your milestones and capitalise on opportunities to raise the profile of your accomplishments. If you’re in an elevator or walking down the hall and you run into your CEO or other senior stakeholders, you don’t want to make small talk about the weather. Use this short time to talk about what you’ve done for them or for their business. Give tangible examples of key achievements or ideas you want to be known for are important to share. Reyes explained that traditionally men tend to be very good at this, and women aren’t as comfortable, but developing your brand is important and women need to be thoughtful about how they convey theirs.</p>
<img alt="Portrait of Anita Prasad, Microsoft" height="225" src="/i/2017/01/2017-01-02-tt-08-wit-anita-prasad-200x225.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 0 2em 2em 0;" width="200">
<p>The second tip was around adapting your style to your recipient/manager: during your career, your managers will have different styles. We need to understand how our manager likes to receive information and how they are going to digest it. We need to adapt our message to the receiver’s preferred style of taking in information. If we don’t, our message could be lost in translation.</p>
<p>The third tip was Reyes’ 48 hour rule: when something happens in a meeting or during an interaction that bothers you, don’t stew on it or let it ruminate for more than 48 hours. Allow yourself 48 hours to digest and reflect, and then put it in a box and let it go. Many women have an emotional response to challenges and let feelings linger. Holding on to negative feelings can hurt your performance, rating and future development. The fourth tip was that women need to learn to take risks: women are less likely to apply for a job unless they are 100% qualified. Often, women need to be pushed to put themselves forward. But, if you don’t apply, you’ll never get the job. And even if you don’t get the job, applying can still have a positive effect on your career, as you and your capabilities become better known.</p>
<p>Reyes’ final tip was that as you become more senior, what is expected of you changes: the more senior you become, with each new role, your professional journey resets and you begin again. What is expected of you also changes, and you may be evaluated more on what you do for others, ie driving profile to your business, helping others achieve, growing the calibre and skills of your team, focusing on group goals versus your own personal goals.</p>
<p>Speaking after the event, Reyes said, “It was an honour to be a panellist in this forum and to connect with so many talented women from the corporate treasury profession. One of my professional commitments is to helping build the next generation of female leaders, both within HSBC and the wider industry. Events like this not only recognise the importance of women in this space, but they provide an opportunity to inspire each other to overcome challenges and achieve goals.”</p>
<h3 id="working-together">Working together</h3>
<p>The conversation then moved on to moments in one’s career where taking a contrarian position or not being afraid to speak out can be of benefit. The panellists discussed times when they have had to overcome different obstacles in their careers and gave advice for those having trouble getting the recognition and the roles that they deserve.</p>
<img alt="Portrait of Maeve Robinson, Omnicom Group" height="225" src="/i/2017/01/2017-01-02-tt-08-wit-maeve-robinson-200x225.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 0 0em 0em 2em;" width="200"/>
<p>Anita Prasad of Microsoft was the second to speak, taking the topic of ‘Come together – bringing on board male allies’, speaking about her experiences with different bosses and men who have supported and enabled her career to date. Moving beyond thinking of enabling diversity as an area that should only concern women, other panellists shared their own experiences around mentorship and the ways in which male allies can help to support women and gender equality.</p>
<p>Maeve Robinson of Omnicom was the third to present, focusing on the topic of ‘Building a talented team; how to get the best mix’. Maeve spoke around what a good mixture can look like in a team and that a plurality of age, experience, ethnic and cultural background and so on can all influence that great mix, beyond just looking at gender as a marker of diversity. Interestingly Maeve gave a poll of the room to see how many people thought of themselves as ‘emotionally intelligent’ and then again to see how many people had ever listed that as an attribute when applying for a job. Although the overwhelming majority of the men and women in the room would describe themselves as ‘emotionally intelligent’ it wasn’t something that anybody had ever thought to describe themselves as when applying for a job or writing their CV.</p>
<h3 id="crystal-ball-gazing">Crystal ball gazing</h3>
<p>Finally Diane Schumaker-Krieg spoke around the topic of ‘Crystal ball gazing: looking ahead’. Schumaker-Krieg explained that in ten years from now she believes that gender roles will be redefined, particularly with respect to caregiving. With growing numbers of women out-achieving men, we’ll see more female breadwinners and more stay-at-home dads (Wall Street mothers, stay-home fathers). The stigma for stay at home dads will gradually diminish and the next generation of men will be far more comfortable with women in leadership positions.</p>
<img alt="Portrait of woman laughing" height="225" src="/i/2017/01/2017-01-02-tt-08-wit-woman-laughing-200x225.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 0 2em 0em 0;" width="200"/>
<p>Instead of promoting women’s advancement, we’ll be talking about a nascent “save the males” movement. She talked about having seen a significant shift in participation in what had historically been “women’s programmes” in recent years. As recently as five years ago, the keynote speeches she gave to corporations regarding career advancement were attended exclusively by women. Now a significant number of men, including senior executives, routinely participate in these forums. The participation of men in these programmes and their attendance at womens’ events communicate its importance to the rest of the organisation.</p>
<p>Speaking after the event, Diane Schumaker-Krieg said, “I see two major trends on the horizon. First, the next phase in the women’s movement may ironically be a men’s movement! Gender roles will be redefined – particularly with respect to caregiving. The second major trend I foresee is senior women doing more to help other women as more of us move into C-Suite roles. As I peer into my crystal ball, I see the words: “Don’t be a queen bee and pull the ladder up behind you. Reinvest your success!”</p>
<h3 id="an-inspiring-day">An inspiring day</h3>
<p>A very enthusiastic and lively question and answer session followed the panel discussion, with many questions from the floor and valuable insights, experiences and opinions shared. Hearing about the paths these highly successful women had taken and the challenges they had encountered and overcome was truly inspiring. Overall the message was clear: we must work together, women and men, to conquer our unconscious bias and to drive diversity in our teams and companies.</p>
<p>Christy Barwick, Treasurer of Intellectual Ventures, shared the following insights on her experience after attending the Women in Treasury Forum in New York, “I was truly impressed and inspired after hearing the panel’s rich experiences, business insights, and perspectives as accomplished females in treasury and finance. Diane Reyes’ perspective on ‘letting go’ of a difficult experience by way of a virtual letter really resonated, as I think it’s particularly difficult for women to do this both personally and professionally.”</p>
<img alt="Portrait of woman smiling" height="225" src="/i/2017/01/2017-01-02-tt-08-wit-woman-smiling-200x225.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 0 0em 2em 2em;" width="200"/>
<p>Speaking around the idea of advice to other women in the industry, Barwick said, “My advice to women would be this, ‘No one will advocate on behalf of you and your career better than you! Don’t be afraid to ask for what you think you deserve, just be prepared to support it with facts and data, particularly if you are a finance professional. Initiatives like Treasury Today’s Women in Treasury Forum are extremely valuable for women across all career spectrums. It allows women who are early in their career to learn from more seasoned women veterans, it allows the more experienced women to pass along their rich business insights and perspective, and it’s a wonderful networking opportunity for all!”</p>
<p>Commenting about the Women in Treasury initiative and the success of this, most recent, event, Meg Coates, Associate Publisher EMEA and Americas, Treasury Today said: “It is fantastic to be able to bring our pioneering Women in Treasury programme to the US for the first time. We are overwhelmed with the positive response from the corporate professionals in the room and are excited to be championing diversity in our industry on a global stage.”</p></img></div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><i>Over the past few years, there has been a loud and inspiring push for gender equality around the world. Almost every industry, profession, and major company now operates their own diversity initiative or programme. These are joined by a variety of high-profile global campaigns, such as the recent UN Women’s HeForShe campaign, supported by public figures and global leaders alike.</i></p>
<i></i><br/>
<p>Aside from raising awareness of the issues and promoting a change for the better, these initiatives are having a wider impact on how society views the debate. Gender equality is now a serious global issue that is gaining traction among governments, industry bodies, employers and employees alike.</p>
<p>As part of this shift, there has been a noticeable change in outlook to an open-minded – and less divided – view that individuals should be recognised on their own merits (rather than on fixed stereotypes). There are tangible indicators of this happening as well; more women are on corporate boards than ever before and the gender pay gap is at its lowest, according to the UK Institute of Fiscal Studies. For many businesses, creating a gender-equal workforce has moved from being a ‘nice to have’, to an economically beneficial priority.</p>
<p>Despite this progress, women are still hugely underrepresented in the upper echelons of companies around the world. The Treasury Today 2016 Women in Treasury Global Study highlighted that 29% of women believe that they still earn less than their male counterparts. It is clear from this perception alone that there is still much more to be done.</p>
<h3 id="driving-the-debate-forward">Driving the debate forward</h3>
<p>Ensuring that the momentum behind the gender equality movement continues to build is one of the key objectives of Treasury Today’s pioneering Women in Treasury initiative. Established in 2013, the initiative exists to support, inspire and raise the profile of women and address larger issues of diversity in our industry. Comprised of an annual global study, profiles of senior female corporates and bankers, community social networks and forums held around the world, the initiative has received overwhelming support since its inception and continues to do so.</p>
<p>The latest European Women in Treasury Forum, held in the historic surrounds of Gibson Hall in the heart of the City of London highlighted this. The event saw over 180 senior financial professionals, including a healthy number of men, from Europe, the Americas and Asia gather to network and learn from each other’s experiences.</p>
<p>It was interesting to hear the thoughts of the many senior professionals in attendance during the pre-lunch networking reception and it was clear that change is occurring. This was most notable by the fact that the conversations no longer centred around the usual female-focused topics of childcare and flexible working – although these remain important issues – and instead focused on the practical steps taken to create a more diverse and inclusive environment.</p>
<p>This theme continued in the dynamic and lively panel debate facilitated by Sophie Jackson, Associate Group Publisher at Treasury Today Group. The discussion was defined by the open and honest views of those involved. The panellists offered many personal and thoughtful insights into diversity, the progress that is being made and what more needs to be done.</p>
<p>This year’s panel comprised:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Rana Fayez El-Hajjar</strong>, Treasurer, Qatargas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lucie Harwood</strong>, Head of Treasury and Investor Relations, Laird plc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ebru Pakcan</strong>, Head of Global Payments and Receivables, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Julia Persson</strong>, Head of Cash Management, GTS, Large Corporates and Institutions, Swedbank.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-diverse-team">A diverse team</h3>
<p>The session kicked off with an informative discussion around how to best build a diverse team, something which the panel agreed transcended the gender debate. Rana Fayez El-Hajjar, Treasurer, Qatargas, led this topic and suggested that race, religion, nationality, socio-economic background, personality type and learning style were just a few of the other considerations that must be included in order to form a truly diverse team. By doing so the company is more likely to achieve greater customer engagement, innovation and productivity, all of which will positively impact profitability, she says.</p>
<figure class="portrait left" style="float:left;margin-right:2em;margin-bottom:2em;"><img alt="Woman asking a question during the Q&amp;A session" height="225" src="/i/2016/11/2016-11-12-tt-02-wit-woman-holding-mic-200x225.jpg" width="200"/></figure>
<p>But how to get there? Rana advised that diversity can be encouraged in several ways. “First, business leaders must develop their own cultural competence, uncovering and reducing their own unconscious biases,” she says. “From this base, actively soliciting input from the various members of your diverse teams helps to foster inclusivity and ensures that differing opinions and thoughts are considered when solving complex problems or making important decisions. Encourage the introvert, the extrovert, even the pessimist to share their thoughts.”</p>
<p>Other practical steps can also be taken. Rana, for instance, recommends that a diverse range of candidates as well as a diverse interviewing panel is present when hiring. “You must make sure you don’t simply employ people who are a mirror image of yourself, however,” she warns. “The best teams are those that comprise people with a wide range of personalities and skills.”</p>
<p>However, in her view, it is great leadership that is most important to realise the benefits of diversity. She closed by saying: “To build a great team you need to have great leadership. If you care about building a diverse and high-performing team, then you have to think about what the practical steps are that you can take to prevent unconscious bias creeping in and how you can foster an environment in which your team complements each other and can thrive through active collaboration, not peaceful co-existence.”</p>
<h3 id="coming-together">Coming together</h3>
<p>Next on the agenda was finding ‘male allies’, an increasingly important topic at our global forums in 2016, which is actively seeking to bring men and women together in the discussion. Ebru Pakcan, Global Head of Payments and Receivables at Citi spoke at length on this subject and the debate ebbed and flowed between the assessment of how the different individuals perform and behave in the workplace and how women have historically not been valued as much as they should have been.</p>
<p>Unconscious bias was again a key component of the debate with combatting it seeming to be imperative for progress. Ebru stated that bringing more men into the discussion could be the key to moving the discussion and general progress forward. “The only way for a minority to succeed is to interact with the majority and involve them in the debate,” says Ebru. “In doing so we can find out what their thoughts are on the subject and why they act as they do. By doing this you can make them aware of their bias and begin to enact change.”</p>
<p>Ebru highlighted, however, that by including men in the debate women are not looking for “male saviours and for men to come in and solve women’s problems”. Instead what is being sought is “male allies” and men and women coming together for mutual benefit. “If we make men aware that gender bias is an issue for both men and women,” Ebru adds, “and if men recognise that we have a common goal then we can all galvanise around it.”</p>
<p>Ebru sees progress on the horizon. “There is a whole group of millennials entering the workforce at present,” she says. “What their expectations are and how they think and act when it comes to topics such as diversity are very different from what has been the norm. I see this then being a great opportunity for organisations to harness their way of thinking and drive this throughout the business.”</p>
<h3 id="seeking-transparency">Seeking transparency</h3>
<p>Further solutions to removing gender bias were offered in the next stage of the discussion, the focus at this point being how to drive transparency and accountability throughout businesses. Given her position at the top of one of Scandinavia’s largest banks, Julia Persson, Head of Cash Management, GTS, Large Corporates and Institutions at Swedbank provided some enlightening examples from the region, which is arguably leading the way regarding gender diversity.</p>
<figure class="portrait right" style="float:left;margin-right:2em;margin-bottom:2em;"><img alt="Group of women listening to Meg Coates’ speech" height="225" src="/i/2016/11/2016-11-12-tt-02-wit-group-of-women-200x225.jpg" width="200"/></figure>
<p>Julia noted that generous parental leave, first-class state-led child care, and equal opportunities are all promoted across the region. She further highlighted how countries such as Sweden actively legislate on diversity issues. Such measures include tax reductions for couples that equally split their parental leave. Given that Iceland, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark are the top five countries in the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report, the statistics would seem to demonstrate the success of this approach.</p>
<p>For businesses, this has practical implications. Julia explained how these measures help drive parity with respect to the ‘risk’ of employees taking parental leave when hiring men or women, as both are equally involved in childcare. “Also, gender pay gaps are reviewed and reported on annually reducing the risk of males being paid more than females,” she said.</p>
<p>Julia was keen to point out, however, that whilst the Nordic approach is successful, issues still exist. Quoting a Wall Street Journal article from 2014, Julia noted that: “Only 3% of the largest 145 big Nordic companies have a female CEO and more than every second woman thinks that an unfair sharing of housework is hindering her ability to run her own business.” In her view, the reason for this is because, despite all the good work, gender bias still exists and is very hard to remove completely. She provided a riddle to highlight this and it seemed to be an eye-opener to many in the room.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote>A father and son are in an accident and the father is killed. The son is rushed to the hospital and taken into emergency surgery. However, just as he’s about to go under the knife, the surgeon upon seeing the patient says, “I can’t operate – that boy is my son!”
How is that possible?</blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source"></p>

<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h3 id="a-bright-future">A bright future</h3>
<p>Rounding off the debate was Lucie Harwood, Head of Treasury and Investor Relations at Laird plc who provided insight into what the future might hold for gender parity. Lucie noted that she typically approaches this topic with some degree of cynicism. “Today has proved me very wrong,” she said. “It has been fantastic.” For Lucie, the key reason for this was because of the tangible signs that the debate is moving beyond the normal conversations around working mothers and flexible working. “Whilst this remains incredibly important it is just a symptom of the broader gender bias that appears in numerous guises,” she said.</p>
<p>In her view, despite the positive steps that have been taken and the progression of the debate, there are still some major obstacles to achieving gender diversity soon. Lucie cites how the ‘old boy network’ remains a big hurdle, “it is just that, old,” she says. “It means though that many of those old attitudes are very entrenched making it harder to fight against,” Lucie mentions, however, that in the treasury and finance world this network is not as apparent as in other areas, such as investor relations.</p>
<p>And there is a positive future. “The people that comprise these networks will retire and it is then I believe all the work that has been done to push diversity over recent years will come to the fore,” she says. “There will be a groundswell of opportunities for people, both male and female to assume senior roles and I believe in doing so those old attitudes will eventually erode away.”</p>
<p>Lucie added: “There are several cultural and demographic factors that will contribute to the step change in how we work and where we work, which will be of benefit to all but will also help to bridge the gender gap, but we will all still need to continue to contribute to the discussion and challenge the status quo to make sure of this.”</p>
<h3 id="food-for-thought">Food for thought</h3>
<p>After the panel discussion, there was a clear desire from those in the room to take the opportunity to hear more from the experienced women on the panel, demonstrated by the variety of questions asked during the lively question and answer session. The questions ranged from how to carve out personal time in the working week, to asking about what were the most unusual or risky hires that the panel had made.</p>
<figure class="portrait left" style="float:left;margin-right:2em;margin-bottom:2em;"><img alt="Woman networking during the drinks reception" height="225" src="/i/2016/11/2016-11-12-tt-02-wit-woman-networking-200x225.jpg" width="200"/></figure>
<p>From these conversations, it was clear that the panel’s anecdotes and advice resonated with those in the room and provided plenty of food for thought. “Events such as this are very important because they provide a good chance to step back and think about the issues that are impacting women in our industry,” says Han Ling, Deputy General Manager at Siemens Financial Service Limited, based in Beijing. “Because of the sheer amount of work that treasury has to do on a daily basis sometimes these issues can be forgotten, so it is important to be reminded and learn from each other.”</p>
<p>This point was echoed by Lesley Rogers, Director, Treasury, Banking &amp; Cash at AT&amp;T Istel who said: “All women, even the most senior, have insecurities and challenges so to be able to network and learn from each other’s experiences is exceptionally important and a unique opportunity. It is also clear from these discussions that there is still a lot more that companies can be doing to support women, especially in areas such as offering flexible working.”</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote>It has been proven that companies that have a good number of female leaders perform better. Companies now are approaching the topic of diversity with conviction, perhaps for selfish reasons, and want more women at the top. This is a healthy development.</blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source">Séverine Le Blévennec, Director Treasury Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa, Honeywell</p>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Annemarie Moore, Group Treasurer at Plan International agrees that the Women in Treasury initiative provides an important platform to make other women aware that they should be pushing themselves further in the treasury field. “There is a lot more prominence of women, especially in finance,” she says.</p>
<p>A reason for this is offered by Séverine Le Blévennec, Director Treasury Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa at Honeywell. “It has been proven that companies that have a good number of female leaders perform better,” she says. “Companies now are approaching the topic of diversity with conviction, perhaps for selfish reasons, and want more women at the top. This is a healthy development.”</p>
<figure class="portrait right"><img alt="Panellists on stage during presentation" height="225" src="/i/2016/11/2016-11-12-tt-02-wit-panellists-624x225.jpg" width="624"/></figure>
<p>Whatever the reasons, it is clear, from the number of senior women in attendance at our forums alone, that the treasury profession is in an improving state with respect to gender diversity. But it is vital that the industry doesn’t rest on its laurels, as there is much more that can, and should be done to highlight the success and empower women in our industry to achieve all that they want.</p>
<p>This point was nicely summed up by Karen Toh, Treasurer at Grosvenor Group. “The path towards greater diversity is a journey. It is great to have forums like this to increase awareness and to discuss how to engage with and get the buy-in of the majority in order to move the debate forward.”</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p><i>Driving Diversity: Treasury and finance professionals come together in New York to celebrate and champion diversity at the first US installation of the Treasury Today Women in Treasury Forum.</i></p>
<i></i><br/><p>On Thursday October 6<sup>th</sup> over 130 senior financial professionals from across the US gathered in Midtown Manhattan to celebrate gender diversity at the inaugural US Treasury Today Women in Treasury Forum.</p>
<p>The forum was held at the sharp Intercontinental Barclay in the heart of Midtown. Featuring a superb line-up of industry leaders, the panellists shared valuable and personal insight on issues affecting many women and men working in our industry, whilst also offering decisive tips and practical advice for those in attendance. Our panellists were:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Diane Reyes</strong>, Group General Manager, Global Head of Global Liquidity and Cash Management, HSBC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Anita Prasad</strong>, General Manager, Treasury Capital Management, Microsoft</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Maeve Robinson</strong>, Assistant Treasurer, Omnicom</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Diane Schumaker-Krieg</strong>, Managing Director, Global Head of Research, Economics &amp; Strategy, Wells Fargo</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The session was facilitated by Sophie Jackson, Associate Group Publisher at Treasury Today. The discussion, defined by the open and honest views of the panel, offered many thoughtful insights into gender diversity in the US and globally, the progress that is being made and what more needs to be done. The varied and complementary backgrounds and professional achievements of the four women on stage inspired a broad spectrum of ideas and experiences which were shared with the audience.</p>
<p>Speaking about the success of this year’s panel, Sophie Jackson said, ‘It was an honour for Treasury Today to bring our Women in Treasury Forum to the US. Moderating such an accomplished panel from different industry sectors was a real privilege and we look forward to further developing our US platform.’</p>

<p>A very enthusiastic and lively question and answer session followed the panel discussion, with many questions from the floor and valuable insights, experiences and opinions shared. Hearing about the paths these highly successful women had taken and the challenges they had encountered and overcome was truly inspiring. Overall the message was clear: we must work together, men and women, to conquer our unconscious bias and to drive diversity in our teams and companies.</p>
<p>Commenting about the Women in Treasury initiative and the success of this, most recent, event, Meg Coates, Associate Publisher EMEA and Americas, Treasury Today Group said: “It is fantastic to be able to bring our pioneering Women in Treasury programme to the US for the first time. We are overwhelmed with the positive response from the corporate professionals in the room and are excited to be championing diversity in our industry on a global stage.”</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p><i>Women and men must work together to conquer unconscious bias and to drive diversity. This was the clear message from our latest Women in Treasury Forum in London.</i></p>
<i></i><br/><p>Last Thursday, over 180 senior financial professionals, both male and female, from Europe, the Americas and Asia gathered in London to celebrate and drive the conversation around diversity forward at the 2016 Treasury Today Women in Treasury Forum.</p>
<p>Now in its fourth year, Treasury Today’s Women in Treasury global initiative, comprised of an annual global study, profiles of senior female corporates and bankers, community social networks and forums held around the world, continues to receive an overwhelming response.</p>
<p>The event, held in Gibson Hall in the heart of the City of London, saw our guests come together to network, learn from each other’s experiences and hear from our expert panel of speakers, all of whom are experiencing extraordinary careers.</p>
<p>This year’s panel included:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rana El-Hajjar, Treasurer, Qatargas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lucie Harwood, Head of Treasury and Investor Relations, Laird.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ebru Pakcan, Head of Global Payments and Receivables, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Julia Persson, Head of Cash Management, GTS, Large Corporates and Institutions, Swedbank.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sophie Jackson, Associate Group Publisher, The Treasury Today Group, facilitated the dynamic and lively debate, which was defined by the open and honest views of the panel. The panellists offered many personal and thoughtful insights into diversity across the region, the progress that is being made and what more needs to be done.</p>
<h3 id="no-holds-barred-debate">No holds barred debate</h3>
<p>The session kicked off with a very thoughtful discussion around how to best build a diverse team, something which the panel agreed transcended the gender debate. Indeed, race, region, socio-economic background, personality type and learning style were just a few of the other considerations that the panel said must be included to ensure that a truly diverse team is formed.</p>
<p>But how to get there? It was advised that diversity can best be encouraged in a number of ways. Firstly, business leaders must develop their own cultural competence, uncovering and reducing their own unconscious biases. From this base, inclusivity should be fostered through teams coming together and making sure that both the introverts and extroverts are given a voice and listened to. Other practical steps can also be taken. The panel, for instance, recommended that a diverse panel of candidates and interviewers is present when recruiting for new roles.</p>
<p>Next on the agenda was finding ‘male allies’, an increasingly important topic at our Forums which is seeking to involve more male voices in the discussion. The debate ebbed and flowed between the assessment of how the different individuals perform and behave in the workplace and women have historically not been valued as much as they should have been.</p>
<p>Unconscious bias was again a key component of the debate and removing it would seem to hold the key to progress. The panel agreed that bringing more men into the discussion could be one way to move the conversation and general progress forward. But one message was certainly clear; both men and women should make sure that they see men as allies and not saviours upon whom women are dependent for success.</p>
<p>Further solutions to removing the gender bias were offered in the next stage of the discussion. Here, some interesting geographical nuances were provided, especially around how the Nordic countries are leading the way in offering generous maternity leave, first-class state led child care, and equal opportunities. Indeed, it was highlighted how in countries such as Sweden, diversity issues are actively legislated on. The fact that Iceland, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark are the top five countries in the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report seem to highlight the success of this approach.</p>
<p>For businesses this has some real practical implications. The panel highlighted how these measures helps drive parity in respect to the ‘risk’ of employees taking parental leave when hiring men or women, as both are equally involved in child care. What is more, gender pay gaps have to be reviewed and reported on reducing the risk of males being paid more than females – with our study highlighting that 29% of women believe that they are being payed less than their male counterparts perhaps other countries could take a lesson from the Nordic approach.</p>
<p>Lastly the debate was rounded off with a look at what the future might hold for gender diversity. Whereas once this might have drawn cynical and negative responses, it was encouraging to hear that broadly speaking the outlook is positive – although it is without doubt that there is more work to be done.</p>
<p>Indeed, some of the areas that were highlighted as needing to be addressed included widening the debate to move beyond the pay and opportunity gap trends and the focus on working mothers – something this forum has looked to do. The ‘old boys network’ also still exists and provides a significant block to the diversity agenda. But, perhaps most vitally, the panel highlighted how change is picking up pace with technology changing the workplace and the next generation of millennials, many of whom are more diversity conscious, beginning to make their mark.</p>
<h3 id="driving-the-debate-forward">Driving the debate forward</h3>
<p>In the meantime, forums and initiatives such as ours will continue to be vital in progressing the debate. This point was highlighted by Kate Moorcroft, Deputy Group Treasurer at National Express who said, “the Women in Treasury initiative is very important, it gives women the confidence to believe in themselves when they see so many senior women in treasury and the networking provided by the event also gives an excellent opportunity to build lasting relationships with peers.”</p>
<p>Karen Toh, Treasurer at Grosvenor Group, agreed saying that: “The path towards greater diversity is a journey. It is great to have forums like this to increase awareness and to discuss how to engage with and get the buy in of the majority in order to move the debate forward.”</p>

<p>It is undeniable that in recent years the forces driving gender diversity in the workplace have gained real momentum. The numbers speak for themselves with many countries highlighting an increase in the amount of women now sitting at board level. Yet there is still much more to be done.</p>
<p>Treasury Today Asia are proud to be championing gender diversity in our industry.

<div class="copy__body"><p>Our annual Forums spearhead the initiative, the most recent taking place on April 14<sup>th</sup> at the South Beach in Singapore. Kicking off with a pre-lunch reception, guests came together to share and to learn from each other’s professional experiences. Key highlights from the findings of our latest Women in Treasury Study were outlined by Sophie Jackson, Associate Publisher, Treasury Today Asia, in her opening address to our guests.</p>
<h3 id="gender-equality-striving-for-more">Gender equality – striving for more</h3>
<p>The post-lunch panel session was facilitated by Jaya Machet, Founder and Managing Director of Coaching Tiger and former Regional Treasurer for Asia Pacific at Nokia. As in previous years, the dynamic discussion was honest, lively, insightful and inspiring, offering thoughtful views on gender diversity across the region, the progress that is being made and what more needs to be done.</p>

<p>Deepali Pendse, Head of Corporate Treasury Sales, Southeast Asia, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, presented her views on gender equality. In her opinion, although progress has been made in the workplace to foster gender equality at all levels, a lot more needs to be done to see the real benefit. It has already been proven that gender equality is more than just an added bonus; it actually provides businesses with a different perspective and a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Quotas are often mooted as a way to build a more equal workplace, yet they remain a somewhat contentious issue. Highlighted by Deepali and picked up by the rest of the panel, there was a broad agreement that more structural changes within companies would provide a more prudent method of driving sustainable long-term gender equality in the workplace.</p>
<p>For Deepali, a large part of this structural shift will come from removing unconscious bias, which she believes we are all guilty of holding in one form or another. “Unconscious bias can come into play when we are hiring, promoting, or in our day-to-day interactions with other people, so it is important to be aware of these and try to find solutions that are better for the firm.” Deepali’s advice was to question and evaluate the decisions being made in light of the bias that exists. In doing so, it will help managers to understand their staff better and help them flourish in the workplace.</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury Asia Forum 2016" height="225" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/singapore-2016/2016-05-06-tt-02-wit-forum-asia-woman-listening-to-discussion-q63a3317-200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=76AC25EBE7F5933F189825EB86B7FD54" style="margin: 0 0 2em 2em; float: right;" width="200"/>
<p>Whilst business, and society in general, needs to make more changes, Deepali was keen to point out that women also have a big say in building an equal and inclusive workplace. “These changes won’t happen by themselves. I encourage women to engage their managers should they feel an unconscious bias exists, or if support is lacking,” she explained.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Deepali believes that women have to want to move further in their career – it shouldn’t be forced upon them. “You won’t, and shouldn’t aspire to become a CFO/CEO if you don’t want to be one,” she said. “We all need to understand our own aspirations and what drives us, and then work with the business to make sure these are met.”</p>
<h3 id="team-spirit">Team spirit</h3>
<p>Treasury Today Asia’s Woman of the Year, and also the leader of our Top Treasury Team – Vivian Peng, Asia Treasurer and VP of Treasury, Flex – was perfectly placed to pick up the next topic: building a talented and diverse team. There may be a plethora of information available on this subject, but Vivian was able to provide some valuable insight based on her own experiences.</p>
<p>In her view, the key to building a talented team lies in ensuring that its ethos and attributes match what you want it to achieve. Vivian, for instance, told the audience that she wants her team to work together to drive the treasury department forward. This relies on the team having three attributes at its core: team spirit; a willingness to take on a challenge; and the ability to deliver.</p>
<p>Of course, in practice this is not always an easy ask – these attributes have to be built into every aspect of how the team operates. Vivian discussed her approach when hiring a new team member. She looks to the attributes that she wants from the team and applies these to each candidate, looking beyond their CVs and the qualifications and experiences each individual has and instead focusing on their cultural fit within the team.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote>A diverse team brings new energy and a fresh approach to the organisation. It almost rounds off the treasury: the ideas are more creative and free flowing, and it creates the value-add that so many treasury departments are looking for on a day-to-day basis.</blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source">Christopher Emslie, Country Treasurer, Singapore, ABB</p>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>“I am looking for people that reflect the attitude of the team, work hard, who are up for a challenge and who can perform in a high-pressure environment – you can’t always tell this from qualifications and experience alone,” she explained. “But it is important that they have these qualities because it means they will buy into the ethos of the team that I have built.”</p>
<p>At the heart of all of this is teamwork. “My staff are aware that I am more focused on team performance than that of individuals,” she commented. “For me a successful person is somebody who helps the other team members and looks at more than just what they are doing. The ones that get ahead will be those who do this the best.”</p>
<h3 id="making-your-way-to-the-top">Making your way to the top</h3>
<p>Building a dream team is also an effective way to push forward your own career, according to Lillian Sim, Head of MNC Regional Coverage &amp; Sales, Singapore &amp; Hong Kong, Global Corporate Bank, J.P. Morgan, who tackled the subject of career progression. “Surround yourself with people that are passionate about their job and their work,” she advised. “If you do this then you will find that challenges quickly turn into opportunities.”</p>
<p>“Women should challenge themselves more often,” she continued. “In the current environment, where organisations and the world around us are changing, you cannot stick with the status quo. I like to encourage people in my organisation to be proactive. This is not only beneficial to the organisation, but it is a lot more exciting and will help individuals’ careers to progress. People will sit up and take notice.”</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury Asia Forum 2016" height="225" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/singapore-2016/2016-05-06-tt-02-wit-forum-asia-table-shot-q63a2809-200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=207A8C63678AFF6ABEFC926EC7B3D0AC" style="float:left;margin:0 2em 2em 0;" width="200">
<p>In doing so however, it is important to remain true to yourself. “Stand up for what you believe in,” advised Lillian. “I always base my decisions on my principles and it is key that you do what is right for yourself.” It can be good to say no from time to time – as long as you have a valid reason for doing so. “Be brave and speak up, this will help you achieve more respect within the organisation.”</p>
<p>Lillian is aware that there is only so much guidance one can offer and that ultimately women need to take charge of their own careers. “I have had many people ask me what I think they should do next and I tell them it is what you want to do next that is important,” she explained. A career should be viewed as a journey. It is important that there is a plan and a final goal that fits into what you as an individual want to achieve from life as a whole. On this journey it is important to celebrate the good times: “When you reach a milestone, make sure you recognize your hard work and mark it in some way.”</p>
<h3 id="success-at-what-cost">Success at what cost?</h3>
<p>Of course, to have time to celebrate you need to have time for yourself outside of the office. And, as always, striking a work/life balance was one of the most popular discussion points.</p>
<p>For Pratibha Advani, CFO, Tata Communications, who spoke on this topic, the key is to seek personal fulfilment. “While life is all about the choices we make on a day to day basis, it is also about seeking fulfilment,” she said. “I am personally not a believer that gaining success in professional life alone can be fulfilling.”</p>
<p>Calling on her own career as a candid example, Pratibha explained that she has enjoyed her work as much as her personal life. “I have not had to compromise one for the other,” she stated. True fulfilment has come by “striking a balance between being a responsible employee and playing the role of a spouse, daughter and mother”.</p></img></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote>We need to be brave to speak up. Our career is in our hands and we know better than anybody what we want.</blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source">Alice Chan, CFO, NETS</p>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Yet with 38% of respondents to our Women in Treasury study indicating that they still do not have flexible working arrangements in place, it seems that striking a balance remains difficult. And even when these working arrangements are available, there will still be times where the two worlds clash.</p>
<p>Yet for Pratibha this is not necessarily a problem. “I am a believer that it is the quality of time and not the quantity of time that you spend with your children that matters,” she explained. “You should have the ability to find the time to be truly present with your kids when they need you and find things that unite the family.”</p>
<p>She also advised people to plan for the times when they need to be away from work well in advance. “One of the things I would urge to you all to do is stand up for your rights, in just the same way that men can. If a male chairman or CEO can say,’ sorry I am unavailable,’ then so can you. Don’t compromise your personal life for your professional life.”</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><i>Last week, over 130 senior financial professionals gathered in Singapore to celebrate gender diversity at the annual Treasury Today Asia Women in Treasury Forum.</i></p>
<i></i><br/><p>The Treasury Today Group is proud to be at the forefront of promoting gender diversity in the financial industry. Now in its fourth year, our Women in Treasury global initiative has received overwhelming support and now includes our annual global study, corporate and banking female profiles, social networks and forums held around the world.</p>
<p>This year’s Women in Treasury Asia Forum saw over 130 senior professionals, both male and female, from the world of corporate treasury and banking gathered in Singapore last Thursday to celebrate gender diversity.</p>
<p>Set in the luxury surrounding of The South Beach Hotel, guests came together to build relationships and to learn from women’s professional experiences. Headlining the day was a panel session featuring four high-profile women, all of whom have had fantastic careers.</p>
<h3 id="an-insightful-discussion">An insightful discussion</h3>
<p>The four highly respected speakers on our prestigious panel were:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Deepali Pendse, Head of Corporate Treasury Sales, Southeast Asia, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vivian Peng, Asia Treasurer &amp; VP of Treasury, Flex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lillian Sim, Head of MNC Regional Coverage &amp; Sales, Singapore &amp; Hong Kong, Global Corporate Bank, J.P. Morgan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pratibha Advani, CFO, Tata Communications.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Jaya Machet, Founder and Managing Director of Coaching Tiger and formerly Regional Treasurer for Asia Pacific at Nokia, expertly facilitated the debate.</p>
<p>As in previous years, the dynamic discussion was honest, lively and inspiring and many thoughtful views were offered on gender diversity across the region, the progress that is being made and what more needs to be done. Some of the areas that were explored in detail include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Promoting gender equality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to build a diverse and talented team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Career progression and how women can get ahead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to create a successful work/life balance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The panel agreed that whilst the region has made progress regarding gender diversity, more can and still needs to be done. The view of the panel was that women have been fighting this themselves over the past decades and the corporate world, and indeed society more broadly, is only just catching up. We must all come together now to work towards removing unconscious bias and ensure that everybody has the platform to become successful.</p>
<p>Those on the panel were keen to point out that women can still do more to advance their careers. The point was raised that over the past few decades’ men have arguably been more ambitious than women in the workplace, but that this is beginning to change. The advice to those in the room was to not be afraid to stand-up and be visible, work hard and demonstrate what you can do as an individual and what you can offer to a team.</p>
<p>Feeding into this was some very interesting advice around how best to view your career. Your own career is your own responsibility and only you can decide where to go next. A career is not a short-term, but a long-term game. As a result, women (and men) need to be aware that there will be ups and down.</p>
<p>The overall message was that to really get ahead, women need to take full advantage of what they are doing and challenge themselves to push forward. When a milestone is achieved, take the time to celebrate that success.</p>
<h3 id="building-a-balance">Building a balance</h3>
<p>Of course, sometimes when trying to push ahead in one’s career, life can get in the way. The topic of creating a successful work/life balance is therefore always popular at our forums – and this year was no different. A salient message was that life is about seeking personal fulfilment and that career progression alone cannot provide that fulfilment. The advice from the panel was therefore to stand up and ask for what you need to create this balance and obtain fulfilment.</p>
<p>Naturally, when discussing work/life balance the debate typically centres on those with dependent children. Yet there was also a clear call from the panel to ensure that companies begin to see this topic more holistically and to consider that whilst some may not have children, they may have other dependants such as ageing parents, for instance. In these cases flexible working should also be offered to assist.</p>
<h3 id="views-from-the-floor">Views from the floor</h3>
<p>After the event Treasury Today Asia talked to some of those in attendance to hear their views on some of the areas that had been discussed.</p>
<p>For Joyce Wong, Senior Treasury Manager at PayPal it is obvious that even though much progress has been made there is still a long way to go before true diversity is reached. “There needs to be a big shift in mind-set especially around how corporates shape their equality, diversity and inclusion agenda in the company's culture and values,” she said. “A lot of companies are seeing the importance of diversity and inclusion as the catalyst to change and drive improvement in business bottom lines, but the effort needs to be top down to see results.”</p>
<p>If this can be achieved, it was widely agreed that business would be better placed to succeed. As Jaime Lee, Regional Head, Treasury and Risk Management at Courts explains: “The best teams are always the ones where both men and women work together to achieve something that would otherwise be elusive for an all-male team or an all-female team.”</p>
<p>This view was seconded by Christopher Emslie, Country Treasurer Singapore at ABB and one of a number of men in attendance: “Women bring a new direction and a fresh perspective to the treasury organisation and it follows with the trend of the ever changing treasurer.”</p>
<p>We would like to thank all those who took part in, attended and supported our Women in Treasury Asia Forum and would like to invite all others in the industry who are interested in the initiative to get involved. Join our LinkedIn group, participate in the 2016 Women in Treasury Study and we hope to see you at our <a href="http://treasurytoday.com/women-in-treasury/2016/events/london">next forum</a> in London on Thursday 15th September in London.</p>

<h3 id="women-in-treasury-get-involved">Women in Treasury: get involved!</h3>
<p>The Treasury Today Group’s Women in Treasury initiative recognises the importance of women in the corporate treasury profession and creates a means for women in treasury to communicate with one another; learn from each other and network in order to help each other.</p>
<p>Whilst the treasury profession remains largely male-dominated, there are remarkable women enjoying remarkable careers. Our Women in Treasury initiative recognises female innovators in the corporate treasury profession.</p>
<p>Women need to be much more visible in their roles, both inside and outside of their organisation and this initiative aims to help bridge the gap. We frequently profile female trendsetters in Treasury Today Asia, looking at their professional development and career-defining moments, as well as providing advice to those just starting out in the profession. We also host a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/7446100" target="_blank">Women in Treasury LinkedIn group</a> providing a dedicated platform for discussion, debate and support – to join this group please email <a href="mailto:sarah.arter@treasurytoday.com">sarah.arter@treasurytoday.com</a></p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4>How have you found the opportunities for career progression in treasury?</h4>
<p>I originally trained as a Chartered Accountant and, after joining BP 30 years ago, I ended up in treasury quite by chance. I had worked alongside the treasury team in my early days at BP and when a role arose in the department, they asked whether I wanted to be considered for it. The job surpassed my expectations and I’ve been lucky enough since to work in a variety of treasury roles, as well as a number of other jobs in the group. I’m actually on job 13 of my BP career.</p>
<p>And what I have learnt along the way is that each role builds upon the preceding ones. Wherever you are, you are learning. Your colleagues are also gaining more understanding of where your strengths lie and how they can be used. Therefore – and this has been my experience – they will then be happy to propose other opportunities which use and build on those strengths. This type of collaboration, working with different people, people understanding my strengths and using them in a variety of ways, is what has allowed me to gain diverse experience across the group.</p>
<h4>What more do you think treasurers – male or female – can do to make their voices heard within an organisation?</h4>
<p>What’s important for treasurers, in order for their voices to be heard, is to ensure that what they describe or present is put in terms of what that project or request achieves for the organisation. This means relating all activity to what the business is doing and its strategy, and how what is proposed by the treasury will make the business stronger and more successful. That can be at both the group level, as well as at the micro level; when it is articulated and designed well, value can be delivered at each of these levels.</p>
<h4>Do you see a day where we have equality in the workplace?</h4>
<p>I definitely see that the position of women is growing within organisations. The treasury community has a large number of young women coming through – this was particularly evident at the Women in Treasury London Forum. The mixed demographic was brilliant. And the more women get exposed to treasury, just as to any other field, I think two things will happen. Firstly, women will feel evermore confident that they can step up, seeing others who have successfully done so, and, secondly, men will understand that.</p>
<h4>If there was one tool that could help you in your role, what would it be?</h4>
<p>Feedback – it’s the only way to know how we are doing both in the organisation and as individuals. Treasuries tend to be relatively small departments but they have extensive reach, affecting the whole organisation. Understanding treasury’s performance, what people expect and need from us, is the way to continually carry out operations in the best possible way.</p></div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>With 30 years’ experience at BP, Debra Todd, VP, Global Treasury Services, has enjoyed two lengthy stints in treasury, as well as experience gained from roles outside of the department. And it is from this diverse involvement that Debra has learnt numerous valuable lessons that she now shares with her three children, her team – and Treasury Today.</p>
<p>Like many of her colleagues, Debra enjoys the “umbrella view of the company” that treasury offers. “Treasury continues to play a key role in developing the financial framework for the company. By then executing that strategy, we are at the heart of the company’s operations. I just love seeing that overall picture of what’s going on. For instance, all the group’s major transactions come through us and that is exciting.”</p>
<h3 id="diversity-of-experience-and-thought">Diversity of experience and thought</h3>
<p>That isn’t to say Debra lacks a more localised view, however. After 12 years in treasury, she spent the following nine in other roles – including in Pensions, Finance for BP’s in-house trading activity and being the company’s Chief of Staff in Remediation Management in Chicago – before joining treasury again in 2010. Not only did others benefit from her group experience during that time, but Debra gained valuable insights into how treasury’s actions affect the group on a local level. “By getting involved elsewhere, you can appreciate how the different functions tick,” she says. And BP’s treasury boasts a number of personnel who have made similar moves, as well as members of the team who have stayed put. “The blend is a strength for us, and it is enjoyable to work in because you see different aspects of each situation.”</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote>My motto in life is to be brave. Earlier in my career, I didn’t always have the level of self-belief that I should have had. I look back at some of the really great opportunities that I’ve had and it was the men around me that thought I could do them.</blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source"></p>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>A similar blend, according to Debra, is desirable for all companies in terms of having a diverse workforce whether that is gender, background, nationality, sexuality and so on. “It’s critical that we have the diversity of thought that arises as a result of this,” she says. “We need to have different ways of approaching the same problem because these alternative ideas allow us to come up with the best solutions.” At the moment, there is not one particular challenge Debra is facing. Rather, she explains, “it is the ongoing imperative of ensuring operational excellence, dealing with change and ensuring that we continue to remain in compliance with so much change in regulation”.</p>
<h3 id="the-importance-of-bravery">The importance of bravery</h3>
<p>Reflecting on her career to date, Debra says she has grown in confidence. “My motto in life is to be brave. Earlier in my career, I didn’t always have the level of self-belief that I should have had. I look back at some of the really great opportunities that I’ve had and it was the men around me that thought I could do them. They pushed me into challenges that I don’t know if I would have done on my own. And those have been some of the best experiences that I have had.” Debra now advises colleagues at BP and others, not least her two daughters and son, who are nearing the end of the education system, to be brave.</p>
<p>And advice that impacts Debra to this day came at a similar stage of her life. “Going back to one of my graduate recruitment interviews, someone from Coopers and Lybrand (now PwC) told me to remember that there is no fairy godmother,” Debra says. She has interpreted this to mean two things. Firstly, you mustn’t wait for other people to do what you want – courage is necessary for success and it is best to be personally committed to your goals. But she also applies the advice when managing her team. “I tell them: if you require my help, just tell me. I’m not telepathic.”</p>
<p>Debra never met the person who inspired her life motto again, but that his words have stuck with her ever since perhaps demonstrates the influence treasury professionals can have on one another. Debra herself can be considered someone from whom valuable lessons can be learnt. A poignant quote, for instance, from her attendance as a panellist at Women in Treasury’s London Forum was: “You can do things you just couldn’t dream.”</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p><em>Although the progress towards gender equality can sometimes feel sluggish, the good news is that, across the globe, comprehensive campaigns and industry specific initiatives are raising awareness and inviting everyone to join the conversation on how to achieve gender equality. Over the past few years, significant progress has been made towards addressing legacies of inequality, with a loud and inspiring global push for diversity. Here, we take a closer look at the results of Treasury Today’s global Women in Treasury Study 2015, which presents milestones to celebrate, as well as reasons to keep up the momentum.</em></p>
<p>Whether new to the world of corporate treasury or a seasoned professional with many years’ experience, the challenges women face in the workplace are similar. This commonality provides the foundation from which a sense of unity can be built upon.</p>
<p>Speaking about the London Women in Treasury Forum in September last year, panellist Debra Todd, Vice President, Global Treasury Services, BP explained:</p>
<p>“Hearing from other women is just as interesting at my stage of the career as early on. I think there are so many common messages.</p>
<p>Certainly for me, I think it is really important that all those things that it has taken me so long to learn, I just want people to learn them a lot earlier.”</p>
<p>Whilst awareness of the importance of gender equality is on the rise, it isn’t quite there yet. Jennifer Tinsley, Treasury Director – Treasury Eurasia at Joy Global, a guest at the Women in Treasury Forum said: “We need to ensure that we continue to promote a greater mix of age and gender in the workplace and not replicate the status quo. This is how we generate new business and build a better economy.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Treasury Today’s Women in Treasury initiative aims to highlight the importance of having women integrated in the industry – at all levels of seniority.</p>
<p>“We are bringing together women to share their experiences, challenges, successes and failures, as an inspiration for all operating in this field,” says Angela Berry, Group Publisher, Treasury Today Group.</p>
<h3 id="opening-doors">Opening doors</h3>
<p>Central to the Women in Treasury initiative is the annual global Women in Treasury Study. Going from strength to strength as it enters its third year, the 2015 study attracted over 300 responses from women around the world. Just over half of all those who participated have been in a corporate treasury role for more than ten years – although for most, treasury was not their first role.</p>
<p>Despite this, there are a solid number of women with aspirations to reach FD and/or CFO levels, 9% and 17% respectively. With 82% also having access to training and development opportunities within their company, these percentages are only going to rise.</p>
<p>Top tips given by the study respondents highlight the importance of career progression, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“Anything is possible. Stop looking for barriers, look for opportunities.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“We must give the best of ourselves, demonstrate that we can work together with men and not see them as competition. There are new opportunities that warrant recognising that we do not know everything – but we can learn.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Find a sponsor and start advertising yourself much more than you would naturally do.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Get a good mentor early on so there is more balance towards guidance rather than learning from one’s own mistakes. Have a good idea of where you are going and have a plan how to get there; there should be flexibility in the plan to take advantage of opportunities as they come up and to make adjustments as you learn and progress. Most importantly, stay true to yourself.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One piece of advice that is frequently articulated is the importance of getting a mentor. It was once again received positively in the study, with 86% agreeing that mentoring is beneficial in helping the advancement of careers. In terms of helping the cause, 58% would be interested in being a mentor to others.</p>
<p>Only 9% responded that they would not be interested, and the remaining 33% responded maybe. There is an implication that the benefits of mentoring could increasingly be felt in the future as the process becomes more commonplace. Sixty five percent of respondents did not have a mentor during their own career development and yet it is continually referred to as a springboard for success. At the Women in Treasury Forum 2015 in London, panellist Jennifer Boussuge, Head of Global Transaction Services, EMEA at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said “you’d be surprised how willing senior women are to mentor. Don’t sit and wait for it to happen.”</p>
<h3 id="more-than-qualified">More than qualified</h3>
<p>Against this backdrop, it is pertinent to celebrate the success and determination of women in the world of treasury. Seventy seven percent of respondents are professionally qualified, 59% speak a foreign language and 68% would be willing to move to a different region or country to progress their career. What’s more, 71% envisage finishing their career within a corporate treasury environment.</p>
<p>There is also recognition of a number of other key skills that are important for roles in finance and corporate treasury – interpersonal skills, financial analysis, the ability to multi-task and influencing skills, for instance.</p>
<p>“You need to be an excellent communicator and be able to articulate complicated concepts to a non-financial audience. You also need to be good at building relationships both internally, in order to get buy-in for your strategy, and externally, in order to get what you need from banks and advisers,” one respondent commented.</p>
<p>Given that 67% of respondents didn’t believe their career path at their current employer is mapped out for them, embracing a wide range of skills beyond professional qualifications is bound to be advantageous.</p>
<p>It isn’t, of course, all about what employees can bring to a company.</p>
<p>Businesses have a responsibility for the working environment created too – and the factors ranked the most important for career enhancement were:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Job satisfaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great treasury team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Competitive salary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being accepted by senior management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being treated equally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Career path in treasury.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access to the board.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="playing-the-right-game">Playing the right game</h3>
<p>Having more women in senior roles might also promote female-friendly hospitality events across the sector. This year, for the first time, the study assessed how these events can often encourage gender exclusion and – unsurprisingly – the topic triggered some lively response. Forty two percent reported that hospitality events are more centred towards their male colleagues, 37% disagreed and 21% weren’t sure.</p>
<p>The fact that events are often sports-related was mentioned frequently, with one respondent commenting that it’s hard to argue that it’s anything other than stereotyping on the part of the host when females aren’t invited to events such as rugby. Given that attempts to balance out often swing to the opposite extreme by holding female-only events, the advice would be to develop a broader hospitality programme and encourage events with mixed appeal.</p>
<h3 id="a-kind-reminder">A kind reminder</h3>
<p>It is easy to concentrate on how much legwork is yet to be done to achieve gender equality – 33% of respondents believe they are paid less than their male counterparts and 45% do not feel their career prospects are the same as male colleagues, for instance – but the study serves another purpose.</p>
<p>It is a reminder that progress hasn’t stalled and there are many developments to celebrate. For instance, undoubtedly a huge part of job satisfaction is achieving a desirable work/life balance and 2015 saw a dramatic increase in the number of flexible working arrangements.</p>
<p>In 2014, only 44% of respondents reported having the opportunity for flexible working arrangements but by 2015 it had shot up to 62%. This sharp increase would suggest recognition that employees don’t always fit into neat boxes, and therefore an approach that appreciates the value of flexibility is on the rise. Such changes are undoubtedly welcomed by the industry’s women and men.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you at the Women in Treasury Forum in London on 15<sup>th</sup> September to discuss how further triumphs can be realised.</p></div>

<p>Having more women in senior roles might also promote female-friendly hospitality events across the sector. This year, for the first time, the study assessed how these events can often encourage gender exclusion and – unsurprisingly – the topic triggered some lively response. Forty two percent reported that hospitality events are more centred towards their male colleagues, 37% disagreed but 21% weren’t sure.</p></div>

<blockquote>In 2014, only 44% of respondents reported having the opportunity for flexible working arrangements but by 2015 it had shot up to 62%.</blockquote>

<div class="copy__body"><p>The fact that events are often sports-related was mentioned frequently, with one respondent commenting that it’s hard to argue that it’s anything other than stereotyping on the part of the host when females aren’t invited to events such as rugby matches. Given that the search for balance often goes to the opposite extreme and holding female-only events, the advice would be to develop a broader hospitality programme and encourage events with mixed appeal.</p>
<h3 id="a-kind-reminder">A kind reminder</h3>
<p>It is easy to concentrate on how much legwork is yet to be done to achieve gender equality – 33% of respondents believe they are paid less than their male counterparts and 45% do not feel their career prospects are the same as male colleagues, for instance – but the study serves another purpose. It is a reminder that progress hasn’t stalled and there are many developments to celebrate. For instance, undoubtedly a huge part of job satisfaction is achieving a desirable work/life balance and 2015 saw a dramatic increase in the number of flexible working arrangements.</p>
<p>In 2014, only 44% of respondents reported having the opportunity for flexible working arrangements but by 2015 it had shot up to 62%. This sharp increase would suggest recognition that employees don’t always fit into neat boxes and therefore an approach that appreciates the value of flexibility is required is on the rise. Such changes are undoubtedly welcomed by the industry’s women and men. We look forward to seeing you at the Women in Treasury Asia Forum in Singapore on 14<sup>th</sup> April to discuss how further triumphs can be realised.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4>How did you start your banking career?</h4>
<p>I had a non-traditional start to my career. I took on a number of tactical jobs before securing a book-keeping position at Allianz Insurance. I wanted to be prepared for opportunities when they arose and create them for myself where possible so I worked toward a degree in accounting, followed by a second degree in computing science and an MBA in international banking.</p>
<p>I was fortunate to be in the team driving Allianz’s successful commercialisation of the internet in the 1990s, but at a certain point I realised I wanted a new challenge. My entry to banking happened when I decided to throw myself out of my comfort zone. I moved to work on American Express’s merchant e-commerce strategy and later joined Citi GTS in 2001 to run its e-business project office in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The banking skills and experience I acquired led me to take on global leadership roles for transaction banking at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, RBS and now ANZ, which I joined in May this year.</p>
<h4>Is there a gender-bias in the banking industry?</h4>
<p>I am not sure it is a bias, as most banks now have adopted policies that ensure conscious bias is eliminated. However, we do still see disparity in pay and perception that the industry needs to continue to manage out.</p>
<p>Personally, I have never been held back in my career because I’m a woman. That said; I’ve had to adapt, speak up and be proactive about articulating my views and goals.</p>
<p>For some women, the gender bias may seem more substantial, which may be due to a tendency to shy away from speaking up or claiming recognition for their work. This is something that can be overcome with self-confidence and the right leadership.</p>
<p>I believe leaders have a responsibility to ensure an inclusive approach to discussion. The person who has the best idea in a meeting may be the person who doesn’t feel comfortable speaking up so leaders need to provide these individuals, whether male or female, with a platform from which they can speak up. Only listening to half the room is a big mistake.</p>
<h4>Do women bring anything different to the table?</h4>
<p>Women generally have more empathy and intuition and this is an advantage in business, where relationships between people are important.</p>
<p>It also means that women think about problems in a different way. They add to the diversity of perspectives at the table, leading to a more balanced approach, which can only be a good thing.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote>Balance is attainable and sustainable. Many career women (and men) manage very busy lives, but the key to success is in planning and discipline. Manage your time like the scarce resource it is so you spend it wisely and on things that drive a good return.</blockquote>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4>What advice do you have for work-life balance?</h4>
<p>It won’t happen unless you manage it. This applies to both men and women. You decide the priorities in your life, and yes, this prioritisation has consequences.</p>
<p>Balance is attainable and sustainable. Many career women (and men) manage very busy lives, but the key to success is in planning and discipline. Manage your time like the scarce resource it is so you spend it wisely and on things that drive a good return.</p>
<p>I don’t think one needs to sacrifice other interests and make work their priority in order to be recognised and successful at work. In fact, I would argue the opposite; family, friends, fitness and fun are all essential inputs to a successful career. It’s what makes you, you.</p>
<p>Priorities can change as people go through different life stages, but commitment to one’s priorities is the key to work-life balance.</p>
<h4>What are your tips for young professionals?</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Have a career direction, not a plan – but don’t feel compelled to stick to a given path. Be open-minded, know what you are good at and want to do, but also be open to other options. In today’s flat organisations, the quickest way up, is often to take a step down or sidewise. Seek feedback from others, as they may see something that you don’t see in yourself. For me, I have always taken the risk to seize unplanned opportunities and it has worked well for me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be genuine to earn respect. Be you, but be open to coaching that helps build your support circle. People tell me I am surprisingly forceful given that I’m a woman, but I wouldn’t change my style. Everyone will not always agree with you and may not always like you, but if you are genuine, honest and have integrity, you will win their respect, which is one of the hardest things to earn in any industry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Master your own destiny. It’s each individual’s responsibility to achieve the right balance in life, whether it is pursuing one’s career goals or managing between home and work. Don’t get caught up in trying to out-do people and focus on ‘quality not quantity’ to drive outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t be afraid to fail … just don’t make the same mistake twice. If you don’t fail you don’t stretch yourself and you don’t learn, and in today’s environment courage and creativity are often the differentiators.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally…</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>Go for a run, watch a movie, spend time with your family and do the job exceptionally well … it’s a combination of them all that lead to success.</p>
</li>
</ol></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p><em>Over the past several years, significant progress has been made towards addressing legacies of gender inequality, with a loud and inspiring global push for diversity. The third annual Treasury Today Women in Treasury Forum, held in London in September, looked to further that push, and tackle the issues around gender equality in the treasury department and beyond.</em></p>
<p>It is staggering to think that, in 2015, we live in a world where gender inequality is still a big issue. In fact, recent data from global consulting firm, Mercer, highlights just how serious this is. Their research has shown that, at the current pace, female hiring, promotion and retention rates will be insufficient to adequately advance gender equality within the next decade.</p>
<p>Whilst statistics such as these can be disheartening, the recent Treasury Today Women in Treasury Forum held at Plaisterers’ Hall in the City of London, highlighted that there is plenty of room for positivity and that with determination and purpose, real change can be delivered. With over 200 leading treasury and finance professionals in attendance, the room was abuzz during the pre-lunch networking session as guests made acquaintances whilst sharing their own personal experiences and stories. It was particularly inspiring to hear how some of those who have attended previous Women in Treasury events have been able to use it as a platform to drive change in their career or organisation.</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury London Forum 2015" height="225" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/london-2015/2015-10-tt-03-wit-debra-todd-q63a9342-200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=6C6C6FB1C0F4A2F95F5C4A69B7B70482" style="float:left;margin:0.5em 2em 2em 0;" width="200">
<p>Despite these success stories, the keynote address delivered by Angela Berry, Treasury Today Group Publisher and Founder of the Women in Treasury initiative, highlighted that a gulf still exists between the sexes in the industry. Referencing the results of Treasury Today’s Global Women in Treasury Study 2015, supported by RBS, Angela informed a shocked audience that 34% of female corporates surveyed feel they are paid less than their male counterparts and 44% don’t think they have the same career prospects. Another interesting statistic was concerning the ever-contentious topic of quotas: for the first time since the study began, more women were in favour of them than against, with the consensus seeming to be that these may help to push gender equality over the finish line.</p>
<p>It was encouraging to see that more women surveyed this year stated that they aspired to reach senior roles such as Finance Director and CFO. To be able to achieve this however, our message is that women and men have an ongoing duty to empower, support and celebrate the successes of one another.</p>
<h3 id="reaching-the-top">Reaching the top</h3>
<p>Given these findings, it seemed poignant that the first topic to be discussed during the panel session was career progression and how women can reach the top. Debra Todd, VP Global Treasury Services at BP, who with 29 years’ experience in the industry was well placed to discuss the topic, kicked off the debate.</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury London Forum 2015" height="225" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/london-2015/2015-10-tt-03-wit-brenda-trenowden-q63a9420-200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=386B290D8A34C5161C711FA792D63398" style="float:right;margin:0.5em 0 2em 2em;" width="200"/>
<p>According to Debra, the onus when looking to get ahead falls firmly on the individual and there are a few simple steps that can be taken to make this happen. “First and most crucial is being visible – for the right reasons,” she said. This extends beyond simply turning up to work and being good at your job. To truly get ahead, Debra believes that you need to build a reputation of being someone who knows their own mind and is not afraid to speak up. This includes identifying problems, offering solutions, and most importantly taking ownership.</p>
<p>Of course, being assertive is not always easy, especially for young professionals. Debra therefore urges women to be brave. “The glass ceiling which exists for women can often be self-imposed because of a tendency to self-limit,” she says, “being brave can remove this and allow you to take significant strides forward in your career.” To be able to achieve this, with confidence, Debra stresses the importance of career planning: “This is crucial in providing clarity in thought, helps to builds trust in your convictions and also allows you to open doors, rather than crashing into them.”</p>
<p>Debra’s final word of advice was on the importance of establishing a robust support network outside of the office. Of course, there is no one right way to do this so it is a matter of making your arrangements work for you. “If you need flexible working arrangements then don’t be afraid to ask,” she concludes.</p>
<h3 id="the-parent-trap">The parent trap</h3>
<p>Flexible working is a mainstay in the debate around children and parenting. Yet, it is clear that parenthood is not a gender specific issue, both men and women have equal responsibility to look after their children. Nevertheless, there is a perception that men can be successful with, or without children, whereas women may have to make the choice.</p>
<p>Brenda Trenowden, Head of FIG Europe &amp; Head of Banks &amp; DF, Americas at ANZ and Global Chair of the 30% Club – an organisation with a goal of achieving 30% women on FTSE 100 boards by end 2015 highlighted this perception, citing a study titled ‘The Maternal Wall’. “The study concluded that businesswomen are typically seen to be high in competence. But working mothers are rated less like businesswomen and more like housewives, who – to quote the terms used by researchers – are viewed as on a par with the elderly, blind, and disabled.”</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury London Forum 2015" height="225" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/london-2015/2015-10-tt-03-wit-joanna-hawkes-q63a9469-200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=0802F99500B9A4EAA6BD325DC56AF48B" style="float:left;margin:0.5em 2em 2em 0;" width="200"/>
<p>What is more, this perception has manifested itself in reality. As Brenda explained using data from Australia, “an average 25-year-old man can expect to earn a lifetime total of $2m, if he doesn’t have children. If he does have children, this figure is bumped up to $2.5m. It doesn’t, however, work the same for women – a childless woman can expect to earn as much as her male childless counterpart, but if she has children, it declines.” In Brenda’s view, these statistics are simply down to societal norms and perceptions that have become engrained over history – men have traditionally been seen as the breadwinners and women as the carers. Yet, despite these gender roles no longer being quite so cut and dried, there remains an unconscious bias that exists which may have helped to form a dominant culture across society, typically with men at the top.</p>
<p>How can this unconscious bias be shattered? Firstly, reiterating what Debra said, there need to be more female role models that are willing to stand up and be counted. In addition, women (and men) need to be brave and call out these biases when they occur, so that people recognise what is happening. Employers also have a role to play and can offer unconscious bias training to help people identify the bias that exists within themselves. To fully escape the parent trap agile working is the key. “This needs to be something that is offered to everybody, as both men and women need flexibility to not only be a parent but also to meet their other responsibilities and take time for themselves. Throughout my career I have encouraged this and it can help the team deliver exceptional results.”</p>
<h3 id="all-things-being-equal">All things being equal</h3>
<p>Offering equal opportunities to both men and women for flexible working is something that Jo Hawkes, Group Treasurer at Marks and Spencer would also support. She observed that for real equality at work, there also needs to be opportunity for men to have equality at home.</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury London Forum 2015" height="225" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/london-2015/2015-10-tt-03-wit-jennifer-boussuge-q63a9476-300x200.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=8B54897589F59A8E76488FCE1304057B" style="float:right;margin:0.5em 0 2em 2em;" width="200"/>
<p>Jo also suggested the work place has generally changed for the better in the past few decades. “As my career has progressed, I have witnessed more women working and at more senior levels,” she says. “Whilst most of us thought it was a very progressive place at the time, the workplace was different 30 years ago. Some of the attitudes and occasional behaviours that were just tolerated then wouldn’t be countenanced today. The workplace dynamics between men and women have changed for the better. It’s a more professional place.”</p>
<p>Against the backdrop of this progress, Jo was surprised when Angela announced the statistics from the Women in Treasury Study which reported the strong perceptions of disadvantaged pay and career opportunities for women in the workplace. Jo also considered the concept of the “unconscious bias”. “Whilst there may be no prejudices effecting conscious behaviour in the work place perhaps some of our more engrained attitudes were influencing us, more than we may be aware,” she said.</p>
<p>Jo contemplated on some of the ideas that Sheryl Sandburg COO of Facebook had put forward in her book titled ‘Lean-In’ that women can lack some of the characteristics that could help progress their career. For instance, lower levels of self-confidence and a willingness to self-promote and take risks could be a contributing factor to a lack of women in leadership positions. In this respect, Jo thought women could consider observing some of these characteristics in practice and applying them to their own working life. “However, in my experience, many women were already doing so,” she said. “But real gender equality should also be characterised by acknowledging the value of the typically female traits such as communication, modesty, diplomacy and empathy.”</p>
<p>Of course, companies could do more to promote women. This cannot only drive equality, but also offer positive financial impacts to the business. Indeed, Jo made reference to a report from McKinsey &amp; Co, ‘Diversity matters’, which showed there was substantial evidence to support the idea that gender equality was really good for business. The report noted that companies in the top quartile of gender diversity were 15% more likely to have financial returns that were above their national industry median. If this isn’t enough for companies to take action and promote gender diversity, then what is?</p>
<h3 id="team-building">Team building</h3>
<p>Aside from delivering financial benefits, promoting gender diversity is a key requirement when building a talented team. This was the view of Jennifer Boussuge, Managing Director, Head of Transaction Banking EMEA at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, the final panel speaker. Jennifer believes that the key to attracting and retaining the best people is creating an environment where people can deliver their best.</p>
<p>For the most part, the blocks which help build a best-in-class working environment are relatively simple. These include: allowing workers to be themselves, providing openness and transparency, utilising the strengths of each individual, offering rewarding work and also having rules that people cannot only adhere to, but also believe in. Achieving these however is not an easy task. As Jennifer explained: “Few companies exemplify all of these. Some of the attributes conflict and many are complicated, costly, or time-consuming to implement. Almost all of them require leaders to carefully balance competing interests and reallocate their time and attention.” It is therefore crucial, in her opinion, that executives spend time focusing on these as it is their responsibility to set the tone for the rest of the team and ensure that employees are given adequate room and encouragement to flourish in the workplace.</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury London Forum 2015" height="225" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/london-2015/2015-10-tt-03-wit-woman-listening-to-forum-q63a9371-200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=9B19B6A26350CBDB01F33077618FDB17" style="float:left;margin:0.5em 2em 2em 0;" width="200"/>
<p>However, with teams made up of people with different motivations and personalities, getting it right can be difficult and this is exacerbated by the fact many leaders are ill-equipped to manage effectively. “As a result, many managers make fundamental mistakes such as unknowingly undermining employee performance,” says Jennifer. “Studies have shown that line managers directly influence a majority of the key drivers of employee performance, improving or destroying performance by up to 40%. Whilst managers can improve employee performance by emphasising employee strengths in performance reviews, they can also undermine employee performance by making frequent changes to projects and assignments.”</p>
<p>Developing a management philosophy and style that is based on emotional intelligence and a deep understanding of the team is therefore crucial. At the heart of this philosophy sits the communication channels that exist between employees and their managers. Studies have shown that this is the single most important driver of employee performance. “This can be as simple as saying ‘thank you’, or ‘good job’,” adds Jennifer, “this doesn’t cost anything but can have a real impact on performance and employee morale.”</p>
<h3 id="thoughts-from-the-floor">Thoughts from the floor</h3>
<p>The Women in Treasury Forums are not just a place to hear what the panellists have to say, but also a chance for attendees to share their own stories and ask questions. After the panel’s initial topic-led discussions, there was a lively question and answer session during which mentoring, biggest mistakes (and what was learnt from these), bravery and the impact of age on a career were all frankly debated.</p>
<p>Following this, the room again became alive with discussion as the attendees deliberated what had been said. From these conversations, it was clear that what was discussed by the panel resonated with those in the room. As Christine Elam, International Treasury Manager, The Body Shop International says: “When you hear people talking about many of the same issues that you go through in your head and that you experience in the workplace, it is reassuring that other people are experiencing and thinking the same. It confirms your feelings.”</p>
<p>It was also confirmed that real progress is being made in the field of gender equality and that this needs to be maintained. “Aren’t we awesome!” says Jennifer Tinsley, Treasury Director – Treasury Eurasia at Joy Global. “Women have made more senior posts than the previous year, but we do need to ensure that we continue to promote a greater mix of age and gender in the workplace and not replicating the status quo. This is how we generate new business, build a better economy.”</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury London Forum 2015" height="225" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/london-2015/2015-10-tt-03-wit-woman-asking-question-q63a9448-200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=94215FDB42C6C142C08ED8D7A4BDBB91" style="float:right;margin:0.5em 0 2em 2em;" width="200"/>
<p>Pushing oneself and being confident is something that all professionals, especially those in the early years of their career need to do to help achieve this. “Women need to be brave, stand up for themselves and speak out when there is inequality,” said Louise Darley, Bank Payments Supervisor at Easyjet. Her colleague, Jade Steele, Treasury Analyst at Easyjet agrees that this will help: “This will help build confidence and encourage women to apply for the roles they may have previously dismissed because they didn’t think they were good enough. As a result there should be an increase in the number of women applying for senior roles and actually getting them!”</p>
<p>Speaking up will also help companies realise the need to offer flexible working, enabling both men and women to have a better work life balance. “This is very important,” says Jiameng Yu, Assistant Treasurer at Vodafone Group plc World HQ, “due to the nature of treasury, there is very little one can do about workload, but flexibility is what makes a difference. Specifically, companies need to realise that employees do not need to be at their seat to be delivering.” To do this, leaders need to step up. “I think young women need role models to aspire to. Even today, girls are still generally expected not to be too ‘smart’ and certainly not too ‘assertive’ (aka – aggressive, even though the two are not the same thing),” adds Jiameng, “I think it is important for those who have ‘made it’ to show young women/girls that there is light at the end of the tunnel.”</p>
<p>It seems, based on the discussions on the day, that this is an exciting and promising moment in history where real progress on gender diversity is clearly being made. However, we are not there yet, and business leaders (both male and female) have an ongoing duty to empower, support and celebrate the successes of women in our industry.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4>How has your career path led you to a role in finance?</h4>
<p>After finishing university, finance wasn’t an immediate thought for me and – like many others at that time in life – I didn’t quite know what I wanted to do. But I’ve always had a knack for numbers and loved solving problems (my dad is an engineer; maybe it’s in my DNA!), so it wasn’t surprising that I ended up pursuing a career in banking.</p>
<p>Not far from where I studied, I started off at a local bank in Wisconsin as a personal banker before moving over to a trust department at a larger regional bank. Since then, the rest of my career has been on the investment side of the business, as I ended up loving it. It plays well with my skillset and I enjoy solving clients’ problems. Every day brings a different challenge.</p>
<h4>Do you feel that women respond to the needs of treasury/finance in the same way that men do – or do they bring something different?</h4>
<p>Whilst I definitely think women bring something different to the workplace, having a balance of gender perspectives produces better decision making which in turn leads to better results. For me personally, I think women are more collaborative and better at asking questions, whilst also evaluating the short and longer-term options.</p>
<p>In addition, if you look at many companies – including J.P. Morgan – their customer base is of a diverse nature, so why wouldn’t there be an aspiration for teams to be representative of the marketplace?</p>
<h4>In terms of balancing professional and family life, is the business world progressing in the right direction?</h4>
<p>When you look at where we are today versus where we were ten or more years ago, the programmes that organisations have put (and are putting) in place demonstrate that the business world is progressing in the right direction. For example: flexible work arrangements, job sharing and improved maternity, paternity and adoption leave. Also, firms that have flexible working arrangements (along with the tendency to promote them) generally do a better job of retaining and attracting talent.</p>
<h4>What can women do to get their voices heard more within an organisation?</h4>
<p>Women aren’t always prone to voice their ideas; it’s something that has personally taken me a while to get comfortable with throughout my career. That’s why it’s really important for senior women – in order to encourage others to start speaking up earlier on – to set an example and inspire younger generations. It is also why I enjoy supporting up-and-coming talent and being a mentor to both women and men. For men, it means they become increasingly used to seeing women in leadership positions and it will become more of a norm for female voices to be heard.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><h4 id="a-global-and-diverse-experience">A global and diverse experience</h4>
<p>Making the move to Hong Kong two years ago, Paula is a long way from where she started her career in Wisconsin. Having taken deliberate steps throughout her career, Paula has spent time across a number of different roles before moving to Asia. Early on in her career, after finding her passion in the investment side of business, she initially specialised in short-term fixed income markets where she was responsible for relationships that produced over USD 1.2million in new revenue.</p>
<p>Displaying a diverse skillset, Paula has also spent time in various sales and client servicing roles in the U.S., as well as running a product team and working with portfolio management. She gained experience at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, Harris Investment Management and Bank of America Global Capital Management before joining J.P. Morgan Asset Management. Paula has certainly kept to her guiding principle – to take charge of your own career.</p>
<p>So why the change of continent? Paula’s move to Asia was partly encouraged by a mentor’s advice to gain global experience. “My experience had largely been across different cities within the U.S. and his recommendation was to expand my horizons. It’s been invaluable. It gives you an opportunity to experience another area of the world, what their culture is, how they make decisions, and to be able to bring those best practices back to your home country.”</p>
<p>Moreover, by entering a different region, Paula has been able to provide both clients and co-workers in Asia with her alternative perspective. In fact, it is something she wished she had done sooner.</p>
<h4 id="the-importance-of-mentoring">The importance of mentoring</h4>
<p>Paula believes finding a mentor to help navigate a new company is key – especially in larger corporations where culture is likely to be multifaceted. “It is advice I would give to everybody, to find one or two people in an organisation that you have some commonality with. I would also highly recommend mentors of both genders as we frequently have different views.”</p>
<p>Paula continues to be inspired by senior colleagues. Hearing Mary Callahan Erdoes, CEO of J.P. Morgan Asset Management, talk about achieving a work/life balance and seeing the results she has driven, was one of the reasons Paula originally wanted to join the company nearly four years ago. “Strong female leadership of a company can help financial performance,” says Paula.</p>
<p>Indeed, many studies have shown that companies with more senior women on their boards and leadership teams generally have strong financial performance. “When you look at the results, they speak for themselves. Boosting diversity not only across genders but also cultures, makes for more rounded decisions which, in the end, result in better performance for a business.” In short, encouraging a diverse perspective within an organisation, could bolster growth potential, which would be a huge win for clients and the industry as a whole.</p>

<div class="copy__body"><h4>Do you feel that women bring something different to the needs of treasury?</h4>
<p>Everybody – whether they are male or female – stamps their individual personality on each role they undertake. I believe that the trick is to show confidence while endeavouring to exclude ego and I think that many women can do this very well. Moreover, I think women are more likely to be cautious and to consider the bigger picture before proceeding with any decisions.</p>
<h4>What more can treasurers, male or female, do to make their voices heard within their organisations?</h4>
<p>Within a treasury department, it is important to anticipate difficulties and risks. Successful treasurers will proactively flag these up to key individuals and departments. In addition, they should also aim to find solutions to potential problems – before they occur.</p>
<p>Not least because of current political uncertainty in many regions, treasury managers should be aware of changes to economic and banking environments as these will inevitably present different types of challenge. They need to share their knowledge and experience to demonstrate that they can provide alternative solutions when normal processes may not be possible.</p>
<h4>If there was one tool that could help you to be an even better corporate treasurer, what would it be?</h4>
<p>A crystal ball! In my role, I’m often asked to predict events far into the future (sometimes beyond what the banks are prepared to predict), so this mythical tool would be invaluable.</p>
<h4>Is there anything you would do differently in your career path to date?</h4>
<p>I originally qualified as a secondary school teacher but, given the economic situation at the time, it was difficult to find a full-time teaching role. However, I seized other available opportunities, which, over the years, took me down a number of interesting and fulfilling paths. Accordingly, throughout my career, each role I have undertaken has led to other equally interesting and challenging positions. So, to answer the question, there isn’t anything I would have done differently.</p>

<p>Honeywell is a conglomerate multinational corporation (MNC) with a diversified product base and services associated with technology and manufacturing. Back in 2002, when the company was setting up its EMEA treasury team, it presented Ciar Timon, now Senior Regional Treasury Manager, with a challenge she couldn’t resist “and I’ve never looked back,” she says. “I really enjoy working in a corporate role that enables me to interact with colleagues in every strategic business group within Honeywell and to understand the different needs of each type of business,” she explains. So – what led the committed treasury manager to the role in which she currently finds fulfilment?</p>
<p>Although receiving her original qualifications from Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland, with a view to working as a secondary school teacher, the career path she ultimately followed certainly doesn’t seem a conventional one. Once Ciar found her feet in accounting, she then followed “a circuitous route into various finance roles in Canada, Ireland and the UK from the late 1970s onwards.” What is evident is that her earlier experiences remain an influence to the present day. When asked what advice she would pass on to others, her desire never to stop learning is apparent. “I would always encourage others, in order to place themselves in the best positions, to take an active interest in opportunities that can add to both their careers and personal experiences.”</p>
<p>Ciar herself continues to devote attention to important developments in the world of corporate treasury. “It’s really interesting to work in a company that was implementing one of the most important enhancements in treasury, the automation of treasury systems, earlier than most.” Automation, she explains, has made a big difference to treasury in recent years – even on a daily basis. “Daily investments, for example, are all carried out via online webtools and automated instructions (MT101s) to our banks.”</p>
<h3 id="tackling-the-regulatory-headache">Tackling the regulatory headache</h3>
<p>But, whilst talk of automation and the introduction of new concepts such as ‘digitisation’ attract attention, the role of skilled people in the corporate treasury function to provide insight and awareness has never been more important. In recent years, for instance, regulation compliance has become a burden that corporate treasurers must tackle head-on. “At the moment, Honeywell is making great headway in areas exhibiting high growth rates, including the Middle East (ME), which falls under my responsibility,” Ciar explains.</p>
<p>“When we are trying to set up cash management facilities and trade facilities for subsidiaries of the business, one of the toughest challenges is dealing with local regulations. These come from central banks and from government organisations. Additionally, sometimes the interpretation of regulations by local legal firms can present quite a challenge.” Ciar’s role, therefore, involves working closely with Honeywell’s in-country managers and legal departments in order to find a way through the issues.</p>
<p>And, thanks to her efforts, in 2013, she was awarded the First Class Bank Relationship Management accolade in Treasury Today’s Adam Smith Awards. Speaking at the time, Ciar explained that: “Our vision is a global one – we standardise wherever possible, but with a flexible approach, which takes into account the cultural, regulatory and logistical constraints in each country.”</p>
<p>Her continued support of Honeywell’s ongoing focus on regions of high growth led to Ciar winning another Adam Smith Award in 2014, this time for regional best practice. The judges felt that the regional implementation of new cash management banking arrangements, in support of Honeywell’s growth initiative, showed an agile response to the inherent risks associated with doing business in Iraq.</p>
<h3 id="emblematic-attitude">Emblematic attitude</h3>
<p>Of course, like for so many in the world of treasury, she admits “things are getting busier when trying to balance professional and personal lives.” Given that the pace of treasury is likely only to increase, particularly in the regions where Honeywell has been directing its efforts, does Ciar seem fazed? Not in the least. And whilst she may joke about needing a crystal ball to predict future events, Ciar certainly has the well-placed priorities and business insight to optimise Honeywell’s position in the current economic climate.</p>
<p>In a world where nothing stands still, Ciar considers that the best piece of advice she has been given is never simply to accept the existing state of affairs. “Question everything and ask yourself ‘is there a better way of doing this?’ If so, then try to drive that change.”</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Speaking at Treasury Today Asia’s recent Women in Treasury Forum, held in Singapore in the week following IWD, Rachael Coleman, Director of MSD’s Asia treasury centre, explained that, “gender diversity in the workplace is still such a big issue because of both perceived and real inequalities between men and women.” Moreover, inequalities are not confined to the workplace, gaining access to the right social circles both within – and outside of – the workplace can be difficult for women.</p>
<p>In discussing the significance of gender equality, it should be considered as a concern for everybody, male or female. One problem is the stigma that is frequently attached to feminism: it has often been perceived as a divisive term and a controversial movement. These connotations can make it unappealing to be associated with and changing perceptions is both an imperative and a challenge. As Lauren Oakes, Head of Global Liquidity Sales in Asia Pacific for Goldman Sachs, explains “the workplace is a reflection of societal norms and beliefs; it’s hard to change one without the other.”</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury Singapore Forum 2015" height="225" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/singapore-2015/2015-05and06-tta-02-wit-christine-jang-tan-img_3698-200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=C7436636C5C0C1A75B69D8651EB654DD" style="float:left;margin:0.5em 2em 2em 0;" width="200">
<p>The change in outlook to an open-minded – and less divided – view that individuals should be recognised on their own merits (rather than on fixed gender stereotypes) is a laborious process, made more so when many companies lack diversity programmes. “Where much of society still struggles on this topic, is understanding the communication necessary and the openness to new perspectives and cultures required in order to harness the benefit of diversity,” explains Shelly Maneth, CFO of ConneXions Asia, who attended the forum.</p>
<h3 id="workplace-inequality">Workplace inequality</h3>
<p>Today, the sad reality is that gender inequality still resonates loudly in the workplace. More than 100 countries have laws that restrict women’s participation in the economy, in most regions working women are less likely to fill full-time positions and far fewer female executives and senior managers are employed.</p>
<p>Where progress has been seen, it is often sluggish and the struggle to significantly advance gender equality is slow. For example, the number of women in senior management positions globally only rose from 19% in 2004 to 22% in 2015 – furthermore, the proportion has declined in many countries since 2009 (including Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Australia, Germany and Singapore). If women’s representation in the workplace continues at the current pace, female hiring, promotion and retention rates will be insufficient to adequately advance gender equality within the next decade.</p>
<h3 id="emblematic-approaches">Emblematic approaches</h3>
<img alt="Women in Treasury Singapore Forum 2015" height="225" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/singapore-2015/2015-05and06-tta-02-wit-shirley-hiew-img_3089-200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=30A76128A27C6B92264DE76874C4FE92" style="float:right;margin:0.5em 0 2em 2em;" width="200"/>
<p>The good news is that, across the globe, comprehensive campaigns, industry specific initiatives and celebrations are raising awareness and inviting everyone to join the conversation on how to achieve gender equality. Shelly recognises the importance of Treasury Today’s Women in Treasury Forums as “they are a reminder of how much more needs to done to effectively promote diversity in the workplace.” The outlook seems positive, discussing her experience at the recent forum in Singapore, Shelly said, “my key takeaway was a sense of hope – I love the fact we’re talking about this, that people from major MNCs to small SMEs were represented; that there were men in the room during discussions; and that there were over 20 different nationalities and cultures adding perspectives.”</p>
<p>When all parties involved understand the importance of equality initiatives, collaborative efforts can triumph. And since 78% of respondents to Treasury Today’s 2014 Women in Treasury Global Study envisage finishing their career within a corporate treasury environment, it is increasingly important for their voices to be heard – alongside their male colleagues to shape that working space.</p>
<p>It is promising that recognition regarding the importance of collaborative efforts is increasing; one of the Forum’s male attendees, Ivo Distelbrink, Head of Global Transaction Services, Asia Pacific, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, explained, “to address this broader issue at the enterprise level, by making changes to company policies and putting in place the structures needed to promote equality, gender needs to become a leadership issue rather than purely a women’s issue.”</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury Singapore Forum 2015" height="225" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/singapore-2015/2015-05and06-tta-02-wit-sonia-clifton-bligh-img_3359-200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=0D150B931406A02D50944A0E43238ABC" style="float:left;margin:0.5em 2em 2em 0;" width="200"/>
<h3 id="levelling-the-playing-field">Levelling the playing field</h3>
<p>The Women in Treasury 2014 Study indicated major barriers to gender equality based on assumptions of aspirations, a lack of role models in senior positions and the continued existence of an ‘old boys’ network. Whilst the desire to encourage a beneficial and harmonious mix of identities in any professional environment is shared by most, whether to or not to approach the lack of diversity with quotas divides opinion. 38% of respondents to the study believe there should be a quota for female representation on boards and an equal amount disagree, with 24% unsure. These statistics demonstrated little change to 2013’s study results yet the recent panel discussion held at the forum in Singapore saw all four members of the panel state that positions should be awarded based on merit – not quotas.</p>
<p>A recurring opinion is that of a general dislike for quota systems but an acknowledgement that they could, in certain circumstances, be necessary to kick-start integration in the fastest way. However, concerns from the 2014 Study also suggest that positive discrimination could be damaging for women in the long term due to the perception of achievements based solely on a ‘leg-up’. According to Shelly, “if you see and understand the bias that exists in today’s world, you’ll recognise this necessitates the ‘management’ of diversity at this juncture.” Currently, whether this ‘management’ should be dictated by numbers or left to the responsibility of businesses and associations is largely uncertain. In Asia, with the exception of Central Asian Kyrgyzstan’s 30% female participation quota for parliament, the upper echelons of management have largely turned away from quotas. Even when quotas exist, their success is not guaranteed, it is estimated that 17% of companies listed on India’s main stock exchanges failed to comply with new laws to appoint at least one female board director by the March 2015 deadline. At our forum, gender targets were put forward by the panellists as a potentially preferable option. This target can be judged by the extent to which diversity is embraced as the norm – where it is the pervasive culture in organisations.</p>
<h3 id="all-encompassing">All-encompassing</h3>
<p>Discussions about gender equality often – and appropriately – open the dialogue on the importance of having diverse nationalities, age ranges, ethnicities (and so on) in the workplace. Although it is pertinent to reflect and celebrate female innovators, it is of equal importance to be aware that other identities could also require further recognition. Similarly to gender equality, problems surrounding prejudice must be tackled when striving for all-encompassing diversity in the workplace.</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury Singapore Forum 2015" height="225" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/singapore-2015/2015-05and06-tta-02-wit-speaker-asking-question-img_4307-200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=318B9A9C36E6A98CE470B06C98341379" style="float:right;margin:0.5em 0 2em 2em;" width="200"/>
<p>Deepali Pendse, Managing Director, Head of South East Asia Corporate GTS Sales, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, a panellist at the forum, explained that in her workplace, much is being done to eradicate unconscious bias. That is to say assumptions based on gender, race or any other characteristic about others that individuals can often hold but may not necessarily be entirely aware of. These expectations can unfairly affect our perception and judgement of others, but there are ways you can work towards removing the influence this bias may have over your decision-making process. “Therefore, it is about each and every manager – when hiring or considering promotions available – thinking about the bias held in their mind. By trying to remove and eliminate potential biases as much as possible, you actually give the job or promotion to the best person.”</p>
<p>Panellist Sonia Clifton-Bligh, Director of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Regional Treasury Service Centre, Asia Pacific, discussed the importance of nurturing diverse talent. “We all come to work with influences – our relationships, associations and experiences – and I think we should recognise them and take time to understand that people have something beyond what they present at work.” Consequently, you can start to recognise people as individuals and, “as a manager, you can complement the dynamic by bringing a balance of members. Coaching and mentoring the skills from a diverse team, it’s definitely a success factor for the organisation.”</p>
<h3 id="getting-heard">Getting heard</h3>
<p>As is all too well known, success isn’t certain. Christine (Jang) Tan, Managing Director, Regional Head MNCs Asia Pacific, J.P. Morgan explained in the panel discussion that “although there has been greater recognition of the challenges women face to promote inclusiveness – particularly in the areas that require greater flexibility (childcare, for example) – there is still some distance to cover”. “Everybody is talking but you don’t necessarily see statistics changing; creating diversity is a really tall order,” affirms Chiew Bee Ng, Regional Treasurer for Tyco International Asia.</p>
<img alt="Women in Treasury Singapore Forum 2015" height="225" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/singapore-2015/2015-05and06-tta-02-wit-deepali-pendse-img_3076-200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=4B936D06542151C07D4F7BE106128D8B" style="float:left;margin:0.5em 2em 2em 0;" width="200"/>
<p>A topic which repeatedly comes up is what women can do to make their voice heard. The tendency for women to refrain from speaking up is often due to assumptions that they are being aggressive when they do, explains Lilian Sim, Head of MNC Regional Sales at J.P. Morgan. “Changing this perception is the responsibility of both organisations and individuals but will require time.” What clearly gives women the confidence to be more vocal about inequality is each other. Discussing her experience at the Women in Treasury Forum, Marie Tyndall, Regional Treasury Manager for Johnson &amp; Johnson, said that “by coming to an event like this, you can take some reassurance from the fact that you’re not on your own. Hearing inspirational leaders speak about the concerns and challenges they experience along their career journey in treasury or finance, gives us all greater confidence that we can succeed, as we all experience very similar issues”.</p>
<p>By seeing inspirational leaders speaking about shared concerns for women working in treasury or finance, greater confidence can be built.” Similarly, what resounded with Lillian was the realisation that women, with the support of others, can empower themselves. “I think it will give women more confidence about what they should be speaking up for. If there’s something that doesn’t work for you, why not have a conversation with your management about alternative options? You could be pleasantly surprised.” As Shirley Hiew, Treasurer, Asia Pacific, DuPont, points out: “To get ahead, you cannot do it alone – nobody can do it alone, we have to do it as a team.”</p></img></div>

<p>I believe it is a matter of honing your organisational skills to make sure you are flexible and able to improvise, whilst having backup plans in place. It’s also important to be realistic about the time that you have available: sometimes I leave the house thinking ‘what a mess!’, but that simply isn’t my biggest priority.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the balancing act has been less of a burden for me due to the consistent support of my husband. We have both been able to develop our careers because we are committed to putting in equal efforts to our family life.</p>

<p>Possibilities for women to balance their personal and professional life are expanding. However, steps should be taken towards ensuring men are given the same chances. For example, the male employees on my team are offered equal opportunity to take care of their children.</p>
<p>Only focusing on women doesn’t help the business world head in the right direction – but giving men the same options opens up possibilities for both genders.</p>

<p>In any business, diversity is important. At Van Oord, having a diverse age range and representation of international identities is just as important as gender balance, but having a combination of men and women ensures a great team atmosphere. That said, I think women bring something different in any profession – generally being better at motivating others, recognising their talents and encouraging them to be pursued.</p>
<h4 id="what-advice-would-you-pass-on-to-others">What advice, that has helped you become a better treasurer, would you pass on to others?</h4>
<p>It is sometimes difficult to see the vast opportunities that are available in the business world. I have always tried to keep my eyes open and not be too focused on a singular aspect – choosing to investigate everything in order to make informed decisions.</p>
<h4 id="finally-what-is-your-motto-in-life">Finally, what is your motto in life?</h4>
<p>There is a solution to almost every problem. However big the challenge is, I remain a solution-oriented and driven person. To make the most of the options and solutions available, however, you need to be flexible and well organised.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Shortly after graduating from Rotterdam University, Marlies Janssen was first drawn to treasury during an internship at Unilever. Placed on a project to implement a somewhat less-advanced version of the cash management software that she uses today, Marlies explains “I had never considered treasury previously. Like many other people at the time, it was a relatively unknown subject to me. During that project, I realised it was something I would like to gain more experience in and I started at a regional treasury centre for Bausch &amp; Lomb.”</p>
<p>Marlies credits an American colleague at the company for putting her on a great, but sharp, learning curve to treasury. “It was the eye opener to the forward-looking financial profession that is really close to the business, and my heart.” Early experiences obviously struck a chord with Marlies who has stayed in treasury for her entire career.</p>
<p>Ambitious and driven, Marlies advanced through various roles, from Cash Manager to Senior Manager of Corporate Treasury, within the nine years she worked for her previous company, Royal Vopak. The skills and knowledge demonstrated throughout her progression at the company resulted in Marlies leading the project financing team in a major joint venture between Royal Vopak and NV Nederlandse Gasunie. A project which she is rightly proud of, the development of Gate terminal (Gas Access to Europe) was often referred to as her third child! With initial costs of approximately €800m, the project was a huge success in meeting – and continuing to meet – the capacity needs for gas imports due to growing demand. As one of her key responsibilities in that role, and her current position, Marlies describes project financing as a hobby – second only to treasury.</p>
<p>This admission is typical of Marlies, who certainly knows how to prioritise. “You have to accept that you cannot complete everything with absolute perfection. Being realistic helps me prioritise.” But prioritising isn’t always glamorous, or easy. “Unfortunately, I don’t always have enough time for my friends. It’s probably my last priority at the moment and spending time with friends is definitely something I wish I had more time for.”</p>
<h4 id="ambition-and-action">Ambition and action</h4>
<p>Marlies credits the strong partnership between her husband and herself for enabling the progression of both of their careers. “By putting in equal efforts towards home life, our balancing act between personal and professional time is, well, balanced!” Therefore, when Marlies wanted to pursue a new challenge, one where she didn’t feel held back by being the second in charge, it is unsurprising that she jumped at the chance to be Head of Treasury at Van Oord in 2010.</p>
<p>Unphased by a company where treasury was a fledgling topic and only an under-developed department existed, five years later, she heads a six-strong department that is responsible for treasury activities worldwide. Marlies continues to add value to both the company and her career, but her contributions are not solely business-related. By emphasising the importance of not only discussing but putting into action notions of gender equality and international diversity in her team Marlies shows she is as forward-thinking as the profession she values.</p>
<h4 id="lessons-learnt">Lessons learnt</h4>
<p>In addition to outlining her ideals, Marlies is happy to share some good advice for others, such as: keep your eyes open for possibilities that you may not have considered, or even been aware of – just how being a flexible individual steered her into the career she remains passionate about.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Marlies emphasises that experience gained from different companies is invaluable. “Between companies, treasury departments will have different objectives and pose different challenges. I believe you become a good treasurer by seeing a few of these roles, the assorted experience bringing value to your career. Encountering the treasury department within a contracting business (such as Van Oord) in comparison to a company which deals with consumer goods, for instance, offers involvement in overcoming different obstacles.”</p>
<p>Despite her obvious experience in the industry, Marlies remains keen to learn. “There is still a lot to do in treasury if you look outside your normal routine. Just because people may have spent 15 years in one role, it doesn’t mean that is the only way the world works.”</p></div>

<h4 class="fn">Erin Strang</h4>
<h5 class="title">Group Treasurer &amp; VP Tax &amp; Governance</h5>

<br/>
<br/>
<p>Erin Strang is the Group Treasurer &amp; VP Tax &amp; Governance of Aurizon, Australia’s largest freight rail operator listed on the ASX on 22<sup>nd</sup> November 2010. Erin has been with Aurizon for over five years, manages enterprise financial risk, funding requirements, tax and governance, and was responsible for managing the transformation of the treasury function post IPO. Prior to joining Aurizon, Erin worked as a Corporate Advisor to government owned corporations with Queensland Treasury Corporation, and in financial and operational risk management with investment bank Barclays Capital, the Bank of England and the Reserve Bank of Australia. She holds a Master of Applied Finance from Macquarie University and a Bachelor of Commerce (Honours) from the University of Melbourne.</p>
</img></div>
<h5 id="do-you-feel-that-women-bring-something-different-to-the-needs-of-treasury">Do you feel that women bring something different to the needs of treasury?</h5>
<p>I certainly believe that different people bring different perspectives to the treasury function based on their experiences and attitudes. However, I am not sure if this can be defined by gender, nationality, or anything else for that matter – it is ultimately down to that individual’s make-up.</p>
<h5 id="balancing-professional-and-family-life-is-tricky-whats-your-experience">Balancing professional and family life is tricky – what’s your experience?</h5>
<p>Having the correct work/life balance is extremely important in my opinion. Whilst I love my job, I do, of course, have things that I like doing outside of the office. Thankfully, our CFO is a family man and he understands that there are times when I may need to leave early or start late, so I am lucky in this regard. Also, more generally I feel that it is important to demonstrate to my team the importance of a healthy work/life balance. I don’t get this right all the time, but it is something that I am always trying to do. As an enterprise we are actively working on ensuring that people across the business are offered flexible working arrangements where practicable to help them achieve their full potential.</p>
<h5 id="how-is-aurizon-looking-to-drive-gender-diversity-across-the-business">How is Aurizon looking to drive gender diversity across the business?</h5>
<p>At present, our business comprises roughly 14% women. The company is actively taking strides to improve on this number and our CEO has set an aspirational target to hit 30% by 2019. As a result, there are currently numerous initiatives happening across the business that seek to engage women including in operational areas where historically they have not been. We have also implemented a mentoring programme that looks to support women across the business and offer an environment where they can talk candidly about issues they may be facing at work.</p>
<h5 id="do-you-see-a-day-when-we-will-have-true-equality-in-the-workplace-at-all-levels">Do you see a day when we will have true equality in the workplace – at all levels?</h5>
<p>I certainly hope so. I look at what is happening in our organisation, with our aspirational target, and also more broadly across the Australian corporate sector and I think the signs are positive. For example, in Australia we have a Champions of Change programme where CEOs of major corporates across the country promote greater diversity and equality in the corporate workplace. For these schemes to be successful however, there has to be male engagement because it is not just a female issue, it is a cultural issue and there needs to be a step change in our overall culture.</p>
<h5 id="if-there-was-one-tool-that-could-help-you-to-be-an-even-better-corporate-treasurer-what-would-it-be">If there was one tool that could help you to be an even better corporate treasurer, what would it be?</h5>
<p>Communication and relationship management skills are a fundamental tool that treasurers need to develop. The role of treasury has changed a lot in recent years and it is vital that treasurers hone these skills in order to understand the various needs of the departments that treasury interacts with and to demonstrate how you can add value to them by what you are doing.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Transporting over 250 million tonnes of commodities across the nation, Australian rail freight operator Aurizon prides itself on connecting miners, primary producers, and industry with international and domestic markets. The company therefore seems an appropriate fit for its Group Treasurer &amp; VP Tax &amp; Governance, Erin Strang, for whom building networks has been a key goal throughout her career.</p>
<p>“I was told by a colleague early in my career about the power and value of networking and, in my opinion, this is vital to every aspect of work and also life more broadly,” she says. This wasn’t always the case however: “for a long time I didn’t make the time to network because I could not see the value in it. Yet, as my career has progressed it has developed into a very valuable tool.” For Erin, it is through networking that she has attained a greater understanding of how business operates, attained influence inside and outside her department, developed herself as a professional and also helped others on their career path.</p>
<p>She also believes that networking is particularly important in the treasury arena. “Treasury teams are often quite small,” she says, “yet our reach needs to be extensive. It is therefore helpful to develop relationships across the business and understand the different issues they have and how we can help support them. The ability to communicate and build relationships may be the most important tool available, not only to a treasurer, but to anyone in business.”</p>
<p>Networking has certainly helped in her career which she admits, for a corporate treasurer, has taken an ‘unusual’ path. After graduating from university with a Bachelor of Commerce (Honours in Economics) she began her career in the public sector with the Reserve Bank of Australia, working in public policy and risk management. Staying in the public sector, her next move was to the other side of the world to work for the Bank of England in a similar role. “It was a great experience working for both of these famous institutions and it gave me a fantastic grounding in risk management and how to approach this analytically.” Yet, for Erin something was missing from these roles. “As time progressed, I found it a bit dissatisfying not being close to business, so I decided to take the plunge and move away from public policy, initially working in investment banking and then shifting to the corporate advisory sphere with the Queensland Treasury Corporation.”</p>
<p>In 2009, Erin fully immersed herself in the world of corporate treasury assuming her role at Aurizon, a company that was about to undergo an extreme transformation. At the time, the company was called Queensland Rail and was under government ownership. In 2010, it was privatised and listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, before being renamed Aurizon in 2012. The role of the treasury team has been pivotal in this process having put in place corporate debt facilities, obtained credit ratings from Moody’s and S&amp;P, managed the growth of the business and its debt profile, and also assisted in building governance policies and behaviours across the business. “The role was exactly what I was looking for when moving away from public policy and it has been a great experience being so involved in the transformation of a business.”</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly for Strang, the greatest tool at the treasury department’s disposal during this transformation was communication and networking. “I encouraged my team to develop techniques to communicate, listen and influence others across the business. No matter what level someone is, no matter what gender or nationality, it it is about finding a style that reflects you and resonates with your audience. This is how treasury gets a voice in the organisation.”</p>
<p>Ensuring the treasury has a voice also reflects her key motto in life – ‘life is 10% of what happens to you and 90% of how you react to it.’ “I actually have this on a plaque on my desk in the office. It is essentially saying that life is all about the attitude that you approach it with. Ultimately, you are in charge of your outlook on life and what you make of it.”</p>
<p>So far Erin has made the most of her career in roles that she has not only loved but that have also allowed her to gain a wealth of experience. None more so than her current role at Aurizon which she describes as being an “amazing journey” given the changes the organisation has been through. So what is next for Erin? “I am happy in my current role, however, when the time arises to move on I think that I have positioned myself to have a number of choices. Of course, my role at Aurizon incorporates more than just treasury and working with both tax and governance has widened my skillset and offered me a solid grounding for a next step. I feel that with this experience I could seamlessly move into a different role within finance or even utilise my business knowledge and relationship management skills and move into a commercial role. Both of these are options in the future”.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>After taking the plunge into the world of treasury, Dawn Chua quickly began to see how dynamic and challenging the profession could be. In this interview, Dawn shares her thoughts on the profession, the importance of teamwork, a healthy work/life balance and the need to have passion for your role.</p>
<br/>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Dawn Chua</h4>
<h5 class="title">Head of Capital and Treasury</h5>
<br/>
<img alt="SGX" class="logo org" height="20" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/sgx-logo-2014-70x20.png" width="70">
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Dawn Chua is the Head of Capital and Treasury of SGX. She is responsible for the effective management of the capital of SGX and managing Treasury strategies and policies. She has more than ten years experience in various Treasury functions spanning across the Manufacturing, Property, IT and Investment industries before she joined SGX.</p>
<p>Dawn holds a Bachelor of Business degree (Honours) from NTU and has obtained ACCA certification.</p>
</img></div>
<h5 id="best-piece-of-advice">What is the best piece of advice that you have been given in your career so far?</h5>
<p>Very early in my career I was told that always having an eagerness to learn, a disciplined approach to doing things and working hard to follow things through, are very important qualities. Only through these can you gain the experience and exposure you need to progress. I have applied these qualities throughout my career, but I will leave the judgement on whether these are the right qualities for others to decide! In all seriousness, I truly believe that one should be willing to take on new tasks because you never know how doing them might enhance your skillset. I would encourage women to be forthcoming in this respect and to have more confidence and self-belief to take on new challenges.</p>
<h5 id="career-progression">How much opportunity is there for career progression within your role?</h5>
<p>Over the past couple of years there has been a distinct focus on increasing awareness around diversity of all types, including gender. There are initiatives to encourage females to enter the boardroom of companies and create more opportunity and motivation for women to succeed.</p>
<h5 id="biggest-concern">Which regulatory initiative is currently the biggest concern for your treasury department?</h5>
<p>Treasury always has to be aware of evolving regulations, and I wouldn’t say that one is of particular concern because there are many that we need to comply with. It is a very dynamic area and one that has to be carefully managed; and, if necessary, changes have to be made in order to meet the regulatory requirements. It is a challenge but it is also something that makes the treasury role more interesting. Working in treasury means being able to adapt to the ever-changing environment and adopt it accordingly.</p>
<h5 id="one-tool">If there was one tool that could help you to be an even better corporate treasurer, what would it be?</h5>
<p>A magic lamp that would allow me to resolve all treasury issues instantaneously! But while I have been waiting for this magic to happen, technology has had an increasingly vital role to play in the treasury space and this will continue, allowing treasury to further enhance front, middle and back office operational efficiency. These developments have allowed for enhanced risk management and allowed the treasurer to spend more time engaging the business partners. A few hours extra in the day to balance everything would also be lovely.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-your-motto-in-life">Finally, what is your motto in life, and your greatest inspiration?</h5>
<p>A quote that has stuck with me since my teenage years is that ‘a thought that one has will eventually become an action and through this action it will become habit. This habit will then shape our character which will then define our destiny.’ I still believe in these four elements and therefore focus on being positive in everything I do.</p>
<p>I am inspired by continuously driving change in the treasury function, and seeing the department become an increasingly strategic player in the ecosystem of the organisation. For this to happen, we need people who are truly passionate about treasury to join the profession because being passionate about what you do brings happiness and motivation. Hopefully, this positive vibe can be caught on by others throughout the industry.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Dawn Chua, who is Head of Capital and Treasury at the Singapore Exchange, entered the treasury profession following graduation from University. She found a job advertisement for a Treasury Executive role, and decided to take the plunge. Dawn quickly began to see how dynamic and challenging corporate treasury could be. “It was at this point I decided that this was the career path I wanted to follow,” she says. “The dynamism and the challenge that the role presented ticked all the boxes for me and it was something that I became passionate about doing.” Since then, she has never looked back and thoroughly enjoys her work.</p>
<p>This passion for the profession has seen Dawn stay in treasury her entire career and experience all the challenges it has to offer. “I have been very lucky in my roles and have been exposed to treasury on both the asset and liability front,” she says. From this Dawn believes that she has acquired important treasury skills to give her a more holistic view of the treasury function, allowing her to develop a methodical approach to treasury tasks that offer benefits to the organisation. Very importantly, she is grateful for the opportunities that were given to her by the companies that she used to work for. In addition, she is also very thankful for the support that she has received from her external business counterparts, such as bankers and lawyers who have been very supportive throughout her time at the different organisations that she has been with.</p>
<p>In Dawn’s view, being a value-add business partner is key and to achieve this, the treasury must operate harmoniously alongside the rest of the business. “Treasury is deeply integrated with the business in both operations and in facilitating any organic or inorganic growth plans that the organisation may have,” says Dawn. She is acutely aware however that the importance of treasury sometimes needs to be re-emphasised to the C-suite. “Senior management are very busy with macro-level strategy and planning; sometimes they need a gentle reminder of the key role the treasury plays either from the department itself or from an outside source such as Treasury Today Asia.”</p>
<p>Despite her experience Dawn is still very aware that in treasury no single person knows everything and she therefore has a strong belief in the importance of teamwork. “Working together in a team complements the individual strengths that each person brings to the department and allows us to develop more innovative solutions for the organisation,” she says. For Dawn, treating people as individuals is vital, be they male or female. “In business, just as in everyday life, people shouldn’t be seen as male or female – they should be seen as an individual and treated accordingly.”</p>
<p>However, some sections of the business world, in Dawn’s opinion, need to embrace modern ideas regarding balancing professional life and family life for females. “From my observations and conversations with friends and counterparts, there is a subtle and implicit expectation for women to be able to oversee their family life on top of their work responsibilities,” she says. “Both men and women only have 24 hours in the day but in some cases women are implicitly expected to do more on the family front.” What can be done to overcome this issue? “I believe that the business world needs to acknowledge that this is an issue so that it can then be managed accordingly,” she says.</p>
<p>Dawn is already seeing some progress being made with a handful of companies offering flexible working hours and has been further encouraged by recent developments in Singapore, that have seen the creation of a Diversity Action Committee, a group tasked with building the representation of women in the boardroom. “SGX is embracing diversity, and our CEO Magnus Bocker is the chair of the committee,” she says.</p>
<p>Indeed, throughout her career Dawn has already seen a growth in the presence of females in the industry. “In my current company I see a more balanced mixture of males and females and also when I go to events I see many more women than I did when I began my career,” she says. True diversity is therefore an achievable goal in Dawn’s opinion. “It will take a conscious effort from both the individuals in the workplace and the corporate world,” she says. “But I adopt the philosophy that positive thoughts will prevail and I therefore believe this will happen in time.”</p></div>

<br/>
<p>Helen Toh is the Treasury Director in Corporate Finance for Deutsche Post DHL Regional Treasury Asia Pacific. Based in Singapore, Helen is responsible for the management of foreign exchange risk of DPDHL Asia Pacific subsidiaries; this includes the centralisation of balance sheet and planned subsidiary risks at a group level, implementation of eFX solutions for spot FX transactions at a subsidiary and regional level which creates process improvement and greater transparency on FX deals, and providing guidance and support to commercial management on FX issues in customer contracts for margin protection. Helen also focuses on Corporate Finance issues including reviewing the appropriate debt and equity mix at a subsidiary level and driving where appropriate, the repatriation of subsidiary profits to the group via dividends. Helen has been working for DPDHL for 15 years, and has worked mainly in the finance organisation in various business divisions. She started her career in DHL as a credit control executive taking care of customer credit management and subsequently moved to a role providing regional billing solutions and implementation for DHL’s top 100 customers in the region prior to joining treasury. Helen holds a Bachelor of Business Administration from National University of Singapore. She is an avid runner and is passionate about motivating and coaching individuals who take to running for interest or health reasons. She also serves as treasurer at a faith-based charity, HOPE Worldwide, founded in Singapore.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="respond-to-needs-of-treasury">Do you feel that women respond to the needs of treasury and finance in the same way that men do – or do they bring something different?</h5>
<p>Generally, I feel that women’s strength lies in their drive to want to do well in their jobs. Women are often more meticulous and pay attention to details which bring a lot of clarity to the figures we handle in Treasury. Women also tend to be better at data preparation and analysis whereas men’s strength often lies in data presentation, though in some cases, both roles can be switched.</p>
<h5 id="balancing-professional-and-family-life">Balancing professional and family life is tricky – is the business world progressing in the right direction?</h5>
<p>Balancing work and family life continues to be a conflict for working mothers. Although we are seeing more work/life balance in the corporate world today, women, especially in Asia, are sometimes hesitant to put family over work and often sacrifice family time in order to complete work obligations.</p>
<h5 id="equality-in-the-workplace">Do you see a day when we will have true equality in the workplace – at all levels?</h5>
<p>I believe the day will come. We are already seeing it at middle management level where the new generation of women in the workforce has proven to be highly educated, more capable and more outspoken.</p>
<h5 id="biggest-challenge">What is the biggest challenge you are facing now as a woman in a male-dominated sector?</h5>
<p>I feel that women frequently underestimate what we can actually do and contribute. Often, we are able to offer more than we imagine. However, we lack self-confidence even though we are a hardworking lot. We believe that we must consistently strive to show the value that we can deliver in the space we are in. I am fortunate to have a manager who is very open, shares knowledge generously and values my work. In addition, Deutsche Post DHL is very committed to promoting equality in the workplace. Recently, we launched the DHL Women’s Network in Asia Pacific which brings together colleagues – men and women alike – in a community online and offline, to inform and inspire through leadership topics and is another step in our pursuit to advance women to the highest levels of leadership.</p>
<h5 id="greatest-inspiration">What is your greatest inspiration in life?</h5>
<p>My greatest inspiration is my husband and my three children, being there for them and being a part of their journey through life.</p></div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>As a finance professional in the logistics sector, it seems appropriate that the career of Helen Toh progressed on a circuitous route before she arrived in treasury and assumed the role of Treasury Director, Corporate Finance for Deutsche Post DHL’s Regional Treasury Asia Pacific office in Singapore.</p>
<p>Helen, a graduate in business administration from the National University of Singapore, joined DHL back in 1998. She made her mark in a number of different business divisions, taking on a roster of finance roles that included Credit Control Team Leader and Regional Cost Control Team Leader. Prior to joining treasury, she was to be found developing and implementing centralised billing solutions for regional customers in her remit as Regional Billing and Credit Manager. “This role put me in touch with the Regional Treasury team; my first encounter with treasury piqued my interest,” she explains.</p>
<p>Describing treasury as a niche area, “very different from the usual finance operations”, Helen, undaunted by the prospect, spotted an opportunity in May 2007 to transfer her skills within the organisation. She would bring with her a unique perspective and understanding of the organisation’s wider finance function which has since served her well in her work at the company’s Regional Treasury Centre Asia Pacific. “The scope in treasury is very wide and while I am already in my seventh year in the profession, I am still picking up new knowledge every day,” she notes.</p>
<p>It is the “continuous learning environment as well as a great team” that keeps Helen’s professional inspiration fresh. But she knows too that within Deutsche Post DHL there are always opportunities for career progression, be it within or outside Treasury, globally or across Asia Pacific. Not least of the reasons for this is because of the sheer geographic scope of treasury in the firm’s Asia Pacific function, extending as it does to some 41 countries.</p>
<p>However, this broad sweep of the region has a more immediate impact on Helen’s work. “It means that we are continuously impacted by central banks and tax regulations,” she notes. Naturally, with such diversity, it is not always plain sailing ahead. “These regulations sometimes hamper the deployment of our in-house banking platform and the repatriation and deployment of trapped cash from highly regulated economies.” But treasurers are a valuable resource within any business when it comes to tackling issues such as regulatory impact and risk management. It is a good reason why Helen is adamant that the profession must maintain and even increase the strength of its voice within business.</p>
<p>Within many organisations, whilst there will be policies and guidelines to deal with risk, treasurers have a duty to “exercise flexibility” in their approach to management. “Our focus should also be highlighting and managing risk for the benefit of the business; we should not be the controllers or the policemen, but we can support the business in new initiatives and use every opportunity to bring value by applying business intelligence to the data and numbers we see every day.” In fact, the core reason for setting up the Regional Treasury Centre in Asia Pacific was that it could serve as the key contact for all treasury and corporate finance matters for the business, divisions and countries in Asia Pacific. As Helen says, “being close to the business is very important”.</p>
<p>As a corporate treasurer operating in a necessarily far-reaching business, the biggest challenge faced by Helen and her team is around global visibility and access to cash held locally in all the subsidiaries worldwide. With different sets of regulations in force in each jurisdiction, she acknowledges that it is a continual demand to maintain that visibility and access to cash in each country. “Within Deutsche Post DHL, we make great use of treasury tools,” she says.</p>
<p>The company has rolled out many solutions such as in-house banking, a cash pooling structure, centralised FX management, a payment factory, SWIFT gateway and electronic FX management. As part of its quest for clarity, Deutsche Post DHL is aiming high. “Ideally we would like 100% visibility over cash, bank guarantees and other financial exposures of our subsidiaries on a real-time basis – and at a click of a button.” In a perfect world, Helen continues, it would not only be able to bring on board mature markets like Singapore and Tokyo, but also exotic geographies such as Xi’an in the Shaanxi province of China or Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>It is satisfying for Helen being a trusted source of information and advice for the whole regional finance function of a major multinational, but when it comes to career moves and personal growth, she has some equally solid words of wisdom to impart. “My best advice is not to give up, no matter how difficult the project is,” she says. In fact, she appreciates colleagues who add value to their work by taking on any project that comes their way – even if it is difficult or has been shunned by others – not least because that knowledge stays with them forever. “If they share their knowledge generously and continue to progress steadfastly in their career, they contribute value to their team, achieving deeper fulfilment in their own work,” she explains. For Helen, nowhere is this better summed up than in the old saying “the more you give, the more you receive”. For a treasurer in logistics, this somehow seems appropriate too.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p><i>After starting her career in academia, Anita Prasad, General Manager, Treasury Capital Management at Microsoft has gone on to become a leader in treasury at one of the largest and most innovative technology companies in the world. In this interview, Anita talks about the uniqueness of the treasury function, the treasurer’s role as a risk manager, and the importance of having a good work/life balance.</i></p>

<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Anita Prasad</h4>
<h5 class="title">General Manager, Treasury Capital Management</h5>
<br/>
<img alt="Microsoft" class="logo org" height="24" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/microsoft-logo-2013-110x24.png" width="110"/>
<br/>
<p>Anita Prasad is responsible for corporate finance, capital structure, share buybacks and dividend policy, structured investments, global cash and liquidity, treasury operations, and credit services for MS online businesses. Previously Anita was Vice President of Treasury and Tax at LSI Logic Corporation. She was an Assistant Professor at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee and holds a Bachelors and Masters in Economics, an MBA in MIS, and a PhD in Finance and International Business.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="needs-of-treasury">Do you feel that women respond to the needs of treasury in the same way that men do – or do they bring something different?</h5>
<p>Each person, man or woman, is unique and building a high-performance team relies on these individual experiences and attributes. I have been in the corporate world now for over 20 years, and the environments where cross-functional projects have succeeded have been the situations where we have had diversity of experience and an inclusive culture. A great team is like a jigsaw puzzle – each person needs to be unique and yet fit in well.</p>
<h5 id="balancing-professional-and-family-life">Is balancing professional and family life becoming easier?</h5>
<p>I believe that work and life do, and should, bleed into each other. Work is an important part of our lives and defines who we are. Technology, in my experience, is the great enabler; with your smartphones, tablets, laptops all in sync with our data in the cloud you now have the flexibility to work from wherever you might be – we are not chained to our desks anymore. Having a passion for what you do at work, makes this much easier because you are no longer balancing but enjoying two intertwined aspects of your life.</p>
<h5 id="opportunity-for-career-progression">How much opportunity is there for career progression within your role?</h5>
<p>Microsoft is consistently in the top few of the ‘best companies to work for’ surveys. The company truly believes its employees are its greatest asset, and invests a lot in development, training, and the retention of the talent we bring into the company.</p>
<p>In terms of future growth there are tremendous opportunities within treasury and within Microsoft as a whole, because we truly believe in moving people from finance into roles in other parts of the business, so they can take the expertise and knowledge they have developed in the treasury and apply it elsewhere. I am fortunate to work for a leader, George Zinn, CVP and treasurer, who lives this company’s values each day and encourages people on his team to take on challenging responsibilities and grow their impact.</p>
<h5 id="equality-in-the-workplace">Will we one day have true equality in the workplace?</h5>
<p>Acknowledging gender gaps is important but we must be mindful because if we look through this filter at every situation, we are likely to end up like the proverbial hammer that only sees nails! Sure, there is still a shortage of women in senior ranks of the corporate world, but we are moving in the right direction. When I look around, I see several women in senior leadership positions, within treasury and finance – such as Amy Hood, our EVP and CFO – but also across other corporations. I know that I am still inspired when I see these strong and successful women in senior roles.</p>
<p>I think the role of mentors is critical, so I challenge everyone of us to give back and be that role model and mentor to at least one young woman early in her career.</p>
<h5 id="make-their-voice-heard">How can treasurers make their voice heard?</h5>
<p>We have a unique capability in treasury and finance to make sense of a lot of issues and risks around the globe. Being proactive, understanding and predicting these risks, and connecting the dots are crucial responsibilities, but we also need to communicate this to key stakeholders in a language they can understand. Converting complexity to simple concepts is key to becoming a trusted partner.</p></div>

<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>It is perhaps surprising that Anita Prasad began her career in academia, not treasury. “I started out being very interested in economics and trade theory,” she says. “I did a master’s degree in economics, then got into the foreign currency aspect of trade theory and ended up doing a PhD in finance.” For five years she was professor of finance and international business at the University of Wisconsin.</p>
<p>It was only when she relocated to the Bay Area that she considered a switch to the corporate world. “I wanted to focus more on the applied side of the research I was working on. Given my background in currency risk management, the treasury function was the most appropriate place to land,” says Anita.</p>
<p>What was academia’s loss has certainly been Microsoft’s treasury department’s gain, as Anita has brought her analytical skills to bear on achieving business goals that she had previously researched. “I have been fortunate enough to work across various finance, tax, treasury and M&amp;A functions and the experience allows me to take a systems perspective when evaluating key business issues. An environment where the leadership team allows you the freedom to take on complex and challenging issues makes it fun.”</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote>Treasurers are the company’s risk managers, but this is no longer just financial market risk. There is global uncertainty all around us, and treasurers need to think proactively and broadly about the impact this will have on the business.</blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source"></p>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Though she has successfully transitioned from college circles to treasury, Anita feels there is no clear path for young people to move into treasury careers.</p>
<p>“When you look at the finance curriculums of top universities, there is no education that’s focused purely on the treasury function. This is perhaps something we as treasury professionals should try and influence,” she explains. “The treasury is a unique field within finance, and having a programme that focuses on the treasury would be worthwhile.”</p>
<h3 id="thinking-proactively">Thinking proactively</h3>
<p>As it has for most corporates, keeping up with new regulations has put pressure on Microsoft’s treasury function. However, she says there is not one regulation in particular that has put a strain on her team. “So much has been going on over the past several years and the regulatory landscape is changing almost every single day. We are focused on monitoring these regulatory developments across the major countries that we operate in and proactively think about solutions.” Anita adds that she actively encourages her team to leverage their banking partners and exploit treasury peer networks to improve their awareness and benchmark solutions around the world.</p>
<p>She says the biggest challenge facing treasurers at the moment is looking beyond the traditional boundaries of the role. “Treasurers are the company’s risk managers, but this is no longer just financial market risk. There is global uncertainty all around us, and treasurers need to think proactively and broadly about the impact this will have on the business.”</p>
<p>She adds that being a woman has not posed particular challenges in her line of work. “I’ve been very fortunate to work in a meritocracy where if I deliver impactful business results, I never feel it’s harder to be a woman,” explains Anita. “Though the percentage of women in senior engineering and technology jobs is still lower than men, there are a lot of good female role models in the finance profession.”</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p><i>Treasury Today’s recent Women in Treasury Forum in London was certainly a colourful event. Stern opinions, bold personalities (and some fantastic fashion sense) saw traditional treasury stereotypes pushed to their limit.</i></p>
<i></i><br/>
<p>In the world of corporate treasury, being in a room with 185 female colleagues and just five male peers is a rather unique sensation. But challenging the norm is precisely what Treasury Today’s Women in Treasury initiative is all about – and for those 190 attendees, the second annual Women in Treasury Forum that took place in London on 18<sup>th</sup> September certainly delivered.</p>
<p>Although conversations during the pre-lunch networking session were already sparking much debate, Angela Berry, Publisher of Treasury Today and Founder of the Women in Treasury initiative, prompted further dialogue by sharing some of the findings of this year’s Women in Treasury Study, proudly supported by RBS. One of the most surprising highlights – judging from the audible gasps in the room – was the fact that 4% of respondents (all female) believed that they were being paid more in their current role than their male counterparts. Somewhat predictably though, the number of women that felt the reverse, was still very high at 48%, the Study showed.</p>
<p>Another contentious statistic was that, despite so many women having family responsibilities, 56% do not have flexible working arrangements. In the 25-34 age range, this figure increases to a significant 72%. So it’s clear that achieving an effective work life balance still remains tough for many professionals – both female and male. And it’s no coincidence that this topic was the first to be addressed by the lively panel session, facilitated by Maia Rushby of diversity in leadership, which took place after lunch.</p>
<h3 id="a-tricky-balancing-act">A tricky balancing act</h3>
<p>Treasury Today’s Woman of the Year – Anita Prasad, General Manager, Treasury Capital Management, Microsoft – was the perfect person to pick up this subject and share her experience and knowledge with the audience. According to Anita, the secret to achieving a balance between her work life and her home life is to not forcibly separate the two. “Work is part of my life, just like my family is, my friends are and my hobbies are. Rather than trying to juggle my work and my home life, I prefer them to be intertwined – my work is key to defining who I am. That’s why it is so important to find a job that you have a passion for so you can feel professionally fulfilled. If you can do that, it won’t even seem like work,” said Anita, prefacing that observation with the disclaimer that it might not be everyone’s ideal solution.</p>
<p>For some, it might seem like having such a close connection between your work and family life would mean that work would always intrude, but Anita believes in leveraging technology and setting clear expectations with her partners and stakeholders to define her optimal balance. “My team knows that I am always reachable except for the two hours starting at 5.30am three times a week; it is my gym time. It is equally important to balance needs of your team and business deliverables and make exceptions if needed. This is when the ability to leverage my smartphone, tablet and data that is always available in the cloud is a great enabler,” she explained.</p>
<img alt="Jennifer Boussuge portrait" height="200" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/london-2014/2014-10-tt-03-wit-jennifer-boussuge-img_9621-150x200.jpg?h=200&amp;w=150&amp;la=en&amp;hash=EAA1C90AF775BD0CE7492E102204DBDA" style="width: 150px; height: 200px; margin-right: 2em; margin-bottom: 2em; float: left;" width="150"/> 
<p>“Similarly, my husband respects the fact that the first thing I do in the morning is to check my emails on my phone. Once I’m up-to-speed with work, it’s easier for me to focus on the family – because I’m not thinking about what might be going on at work in the back of my mind,” she admitted. You need to live in the moment and be fully devoted to work (or family) while you are at work (or vacationing with family); don’t feel guilty about spending time on either aspect of your life.</p>
<p>In addition to setting clear boundaries, “I have a set of clear principles that guide me in everything I do: honesty, integrity and trust,” Anita told the audience. These principles have helped her throughout her career to maintain the work/life relationship that she has so successfully mastered.</p>
<h3 id="battle-of-the-sexes">Battle of the sexes</h3>
<p>The next panellist to speak was Jennifer Boussuge, Head of Global Transaction Services, EMEA, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, who tackled the topic of driving equality. Like Anita, Jennifer wakes up every day with her BlackBerry in her hand – but she too has a very understanding husband who, Jennifer explained, actually put his career on hold in order to allow her to progress.</p>
<p>“I’m extremely lucky because, throughout my career, I’ve been given the support that I need both at home and in the workplace. Many women don’t have that luxury and they struggle to reach their full potential in the workplace as a result,” noted Jennifer. “That’s a real shame, because the statistics around the value that women in senior positions bring to a company are quite something. A McKinsey study, across all industry sectors, found that the companies with the highest proportion of women on their boards significantly, and consistently, outperformed those with no female representation by 41% in terms of return on equity, and by 56% in terms of operating results. The numbers speak for themselves.”</p>
<img alt="Photo of guest during presentation" height="200" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/london-2014/2014-10-tt-03-wit-during-presentation-img_9756-150x200.jpg?h=200&amp;w=150&amp;la=en&amp;hash=FF9C451B0950FB84E95277BA47949529" style="width: 150px; height: 200px; margin-bottom: 2em; margin-left: 2em; float: right;" width="150"/> 
<p>So what is holding women back? “What women require to be successful isn’t always the same as what men need to be successful,” Jennifer observed. “We need to carefully consider the level of coaching and mentoring that we are providing for women – not only on returning from maternity leave, but throughout their careers. Women often aren’t as vocal as men in the workplace, and managers need to recognise that. Just because women don’t voice their desire for promotion, doesn’t mean that they don’t want the opportunity.”</p>
<p>As well as improving the formal networks, it is also important for women to take it upon themselves to do more informal networking, she explained. “Men play golf or go to the pub on Thursday nights for a drink. Creating these kind of networks for women, while also ensuring they have key sponsors and mentors from within the organisation, are vital to encourage greater diversity at senior levels.”</p>
<h3 id="the-dream-team">The dream team</h3>
<p>Sonia De Paolis, Treasury Director at TomTom – and the next panellist to speak – agreed with Jennifer’s observations, saying: “We work in a male-dominated environment and we need to create the space for women to proceed. As such, it is important to have self-awareness about what you want to do and where you want to go; don’t just do what is expected.”</p>
<p>On the subject of nurturing talent, Sonia had some useful, practical advice for attendees: “When you look for talent, the most important thing is to put your biases to one side.” She went on to explain that there are sometimes hidden gems – people that might not necessarily tick all the boxes on paper, but in reality have a lot to offer. “As an example, there was a young lady who was in an administrative role in another department in our company, who volunteered to get involved in a cross-functional project at a time when no-one from that department was being overly co-operative. She was absolutely brilliant when we collaborated, so much so that we invited her to join our team and gave her the opportunity to study for her qualifications as well. She jumped at the chance and she was enormously motivated by the recognition of her abilities.”</p>
<p>Not only is it important to nurture hidden talents, but the whole team should be given something to believe in – a vision and a mission, Sonia added. “Creating a work environment where people feel that they are really part of something is invaluable. People work hard for what they believe in.”</p>
<h3 id="climbing-the-ladder">Climbing the ladder</h3>
<p>Building a dream team is also a very important step in helping you to get further ahead in your career, according to the final panellist, Claudia Colic, Head of Transaction Banking, UBS AG, Switzerland. “You need to have the confidence to hire the best team possible – don’t be afraid to hire people that are better than you at certain aspects of the job and don’t be afraid to be challenged by your team,” she advised.</p>
<img alt="Photo of guest speaking" height="200" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/women-in-treasury/london-2014/2014-10-tt-03-wit-guest-speaking-img_9873-150x200.jpg?h=200&amp;w=150&amp;la=en&amp;hash=55189D3704E66AD4F7C04850B0C8AE67" style="width: 150px; height: 200px; margin-right: 2em; margin-bottom: 2em; float: left;" width="150"/> 
<p>Other key steps in moving up the career ladder, said Claudia, are: understanding who you are and recognising where your strengths, weaknesses and interests lie. “Once you know what you want and what your interests are, then you can match them with your strengths – not that they are always complementary. Then, you can begin to cultivate a recognisable identity for yourself, rather like a personal brand, so that everyone knows what you stand for.” To really get ahead, this brand also needs to be authentic, Claudia noted. “Generally speaking, women aren’t good at pretending to be something they’re not.”</p>
<p>Finally, Claudia advised attendees to work on communicating with confidence if they want to get ahead in their career. “Because of our collaborative nature, women often like to ask others their opinion, so that everyone has a chance to voice their thoughts. Although this is in many ways good for the team, it can make it seem like you don’t have a firm opinion of your own. That’s not what people look for in a leader – they want someone who knows their own mind.”</p>
<h3 id="securing-success">Securing success</h3>
<p>After the panel’s individual presentations, there was a lively question and answer session that covered everything from part-time working to the relative productivity of women returning from maternity leave – which interestingly, the panel felt was actually greater, since new mothers are more motivated to get everything done in order to leave the office at a decent hour!</p>
<p>Some additional networking then took place over coffee before the event closed. This was a good opportunity to gather some feedback on the Forum from attendees and to find out what advice they would be taking away from the event. Karen Van den Driessche, EMEA Treasury Director, AVNET, said: “Anita is the perfect fit for the Woman of the Year Award, she totally deserves it. I particularly enjoyed her comments about managing your work/life balance effectively, and that if you are passionate about something then it shouldn’t be seen as work.”</p>
 
<p>Francesca Mosca, Director, Client Coverage at ING was impressed by the 360 degree approach to the topic of Women in Treasury. “There really was advice for everyone from the panel, whether it be how to learn from your mistakes, or how to leverage informal as well as formal networks in order to get ahead. Another key takeaway for me was the panel’s advice around building a brand for yourself. It’s important to match your strengths with your interests and skills, so that you can be confident in what you do.</p>
<p>On the topic of work/life balance, the point around distinguishing between a job and a career seemed to strike a real chord with the audience. A job is a nine to five, but a career will always be part of your life. To be successful in your career, there will naturally be risks that need to be taken and compromises that need to be made,” she said.</p>
<p>Helen Robbins, Senior Manager, Institutional Client Propositions, HSBC Global Asset Management agreed that the stories from the panel were very inspiring. “I liked the point that even senior women still need a mentor. And that it’s ok to ask someone to be your mentor – women should have the confidence to do this. It is also important to understand how others have overcome issues in the workplace and you don’t often get that opportunity outside of events such as this. The Women in Treasury Forum is a vital platform for networking and knowledge-sharing,” she observed.</p>
<p>The mentoring discussion was also very interesting for Claudia Ehler, European Treasury Manager at SPX Corporation. “I haven’t had a mentor for many years and I’ve been inspired by the panel’s comments to go and look for a mentor. I’ve also learned that it’s ok to ask people that aren’t necessarily in your immediate work circle to mentor you – it could be someone that you admire in another company.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere, “getting together with peers and having a forum focused on women makes the discussion more open and frank as we have similar challenges to manage,” commented Claudia. This sentiment was shared by many others in the audience, who greatly appreciated the focus of the event, but would also like to see more men at next year’s event so that they can hear first-hand about the challenges that women face in the world of treasury. Consider the gauntlet well and truly thrown down.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>The backbone of Treasury Today’s ground-breaking Women in Treasury initiative is the annual Study that we conduct among female treasury professionals across the globe. This year’s Study, proudly supported by RBS, builds a clear picture of the careers of women across the industry.</p>
<br/>
<figure class="left"><img alt="Women in Treasury Annual Study 2014 proudly supported by RBS" height="82" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/wit/2014/logo-women-in-treasury-study-2014-iaw-rbs-626x82.png" width="626"/></figure>
<p>Conducted between April and September 2014, the Study attracted over 220 responses from a broad universe of respondents. From a geographical perspective, 22% of respondents were located in the Asia-Pacific region, 14% in the Americas, and 62% in Europe, with the remainder being Rest of World. Respondents were aged between 25 and 65 years; 57% have been working in corporate treasury for over 10 years and 76% are professionally qualified.</p>
<h3 id="highlights">Highlights</h3>
<p>One of the most contentious areas of the Study was, unsurprisingly, pay equality. This year’s findings reveal that 48% felt they were being paid the same as their male counterparts, 48% felt they were being paid less, and 4% felt they were being paid more. This is an improvement on the 2013 results, which indicated that 58% believed they were not being paid the same as their male colleagues.</p>
<p>An aspect of corporate life where there is still a great deal of room for improvement (not just for women but for men too) is around mentoring. Despite an enormous 98% believing that mentoring is beneficial in career advancement, only 37% of companies provide a mentoring programme. The number of companies that still do not allow flexible working arrangement is also high – at 44%. So it is clear that corporate attitudes to modern life and the needs of their employees still have some way to progress.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the level of support that mothers returning to work from maternity leave are receiving from their employers appears to be positive, with three-quarters of respondents saying that the company they work for is proactive in this regard. Interestingly, despite just over half of respondents (53%) having dependent children, 77% said they were prepared to move to a new region or country in order to progress their career.</p>
<p>When we asked respondents in more detail about their career aspirations, the majority were ultimately aiming for the role of Group Treasurer, with Director Treasury &amp; Finance in second place, and CFO third. One of the more surprising findings of this year’s Study was that when asked to rank certain factors in order of importance to their career enhancement, job satisfaction was voted the number one most important factor – above a clear career path in treasury; above being treated equally; and above being accepted by senior management. This begs the question: if women were treated equally; had a clear career path; and were accepted by senior management; would that actually lead to increased job satisfaction?</p>
<h3 id="moving-ahead">Moving ahead</h3>
<p>As we build on the Women in Treasury Study each year, we will continue to analyse the questions and challenges that the females in our profession face every day. We will also strive to share best practice and knowledge among the treasury community. To that end, we would like to thank everyone involved in this year’s Study – we could not have done it without you.</p>
<p>We’d also like to encourage you to join our Women in Treasury LinkedIn Group where you can carry on the discussion, contribute your insights and benefit from an amazing networking opportunity. Simply contact our Circulation Manager, <a href="mailto:sarah.arter@treasurytoday.com">Sarah Arter</a> to join and be part of our successful programme.</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p>Speaking on behalf of RBS, an organisation committed to promoting diversity within the workplace, I believe supporting the Treasury Today Women in Treasury initiative is a natural extension of how seriously we take our responsibility to build understanding and encourage discussion around this important topic. But as a woman working in a male-dominated industry, I also know how absolutely vital it is to share the experiences, the challenges, the successes and the failures, so that we may speak as one within in our chosen profession.</p>
<p>In the course of my career in treasury I have met many incredible women, all of whom have been innovative, determined and ready to help others achieve success in their chosen field. The 2014 Women in Treasury Study gives voice to these inspirational people. But more importantly, it delivers a clear picture of the careers of all women across the industry, from the most senior to the most junior, allowing everyone to have their say.</p>
<p>The 2014 Women in Treasury Study is a valuable contribution to the discussion and promotion of the issues that really matter to women in the workplace. We all have responsibilities to our organisations, but we also have responsibilities to ourselves and to our families too. Hearing how other women in treasury tackle the core issues of work-life balance, career progression, mentoring and pay parity, all the while maintaining a sense of personal identity gives a focus to the voice of women in treasury. As sponsor and as a woman I am proud to be a part of it.</p>

<h5 id="biggest-challenge-facing">What is the biggest challenge you are facing now, as a corporate treasurer? And as a woman in a male-dominated sector?</h5>
<p>The difficulties we face as Treasurers aren’t too different for women or men. We are all challenged with how to best support our businesses in a world that is ever-changing. Regulations and technology continue to evolve, and this keeps us on our toes as we continuously assess and manage the challenges and opportunities that come with this from a treasury perspective.</p>
<h5 id="business-world-progressing-in-right-direction">Balancing professional and family life is tricky – is the business world progressing in the right direction?</h5>
<p>At times it can be quite chaotic. I think the progress we are benefitting from in this space is twofold. Firstly, advances in technology are facilitating a more flexible and balanced life. With remote access, I can be volunteering at my children’s school and still stay connected for anything urgent.</p>
<p>Secondly, I think we are truly realising a shift in mindset, in that you don’t always have to be sitting at your desk during office hours to be working hard, meeting deadlines and delivering great results. It depends on the type of role you’re in and your direct responsibilities, but I have definitely seen progress. I have also learned to take charge of my schedule and block time for personal things that are important to me. Sometimes this is a bit easier working in Asia Pacific for a US-based company because often my work day is night-time conference calls with the US. But I’ve found if you don’t take charge of making your own balance, no one else will do it for you.</p>
<h5 id="greatest-inspriation">What is your motto in life, or your greatest inspiration?</h5>
<p>My kids and husband are my greatest inspiration. They keep me grounded and remind me of what’s most important; enjoy life each day and take nothing for granted. You could say my motto is “live in the moment”.</p>
<h5 id="one-thing-cannot-do-without">As a treasurer, what is one thing that you just cannot do without?</h5>
<p>Hands down, it’s a great team. Our regional treasury team is located in China, India, Japan and Singapore. With the complexities that come with doing business in the Asia Pacific region, it’s critical to have an engaged, proactive and diverse team that can execute well. I’m very proud of the team we have today.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>“I wanted to work in finance in a role that would provide some variety of work,” says Kristen Covey, Asia Treasurer of global engineering company, Caterpillar. As she recalls her move in 1996 into the firm’s treasury team based at its corporate headquarters in Peoria, Illinois, she adds that being close to family and friends was also “appealing”. Here then are two elements that pretty much sum up Kristen’s career model: the quest for variety and continuous learning, balanced with an understanding that family, friends and ‘the team’ must never be forsaken.</p>
<p>Finding that balance can be difficult; it is a daily exercise for Kristen, especially now that she is based in Singapore away from her extended family. “It forces you to think about what is important and you are not always going to be able to predict personal or professional needs. It requires constant navigation through that to be able to attend to everything professionally and maintain time for yourself,” she says. The balancing act, she reports, does become easier with time, helped by an employer that genuinely espouses a “family-first” culture.</p>
<p>As one who appreciates the value of new experiences, Kristen has maximised the opportunities that have come her way. “You might say performing a variety of work is an understatement,” she comments. “I’ve had 12 positions in my 18 years with Caterpillar, with two overseas assignments including my position today in Singapore.” The diversity of roles to date includes marketing finance, Six Sigma, funding, foreign currency risk management and orders. Each provided “unique opportunities for growth and development”.</p>
<p>The key to Kristen’s success has been taking those opportunities as they come, regardless of how daunting they may have first seemed. Within three years of working for Caterpillar she had accepted an overseas assignment in Chile as one of the first female Americans the company had sent to South America. “I believe I wouldn’t have had this opportunity if it weren’t for the manager overseeing our finance programme at the time who helped me secure the position,” she notes. Despite “legitimate concerns” about safety, Kristen says she is thankful for having been given the opportunity, providing her with a commercial and personal perspective which she still calls upon today.</p>
<p>In a male-dominated profession, in the even more male-dominated engineering sector, Kristen chooses to focus on what the individual brings to the team. “I strive to create a team environment filled with trust, transparency and empowerment,” she states. As a result of her inclusive approach she takes pleasure in the success of others, male or female. “The most rewarding days, for me personally, are those when I see my team members growing and developing, delivering on challenging goals and really feeling proud of their achievements.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Kristen consciously enables all team members to fly solo as much as possible whilst offering guidance and reassurance when needed. “I’m hands-on when I feel I need to be but I really feel that a team is most efficient when everyone knows what needs to get done, they have the right tools and resources to do so, and they have support along the way. In the end they feel better about what they have achieved because it is due to their own effort.”</p>
<p>In this environment opportunities open up more readily for those with talent. For Kristen the gender-based ‘glass ceiling’ has not limited her progress to date. “The term ‘may the best man or woman win’ should apply – and it does within Caterpillar,” she reports. Her Chilean assignment was won in this spirit; clearly talent is welcome when it has the ability to see through problems and find resolutions. There are challenges that may be real threats, she notes, “but more often than not if you dig deep enough you can find the opportunity”.</p>
<p>In fact, Kristen feels that the treasury profession in general is in an opportunistic position to make its voice heard louder and clearer than ever before. Through the positive action of innovation, finding new ways to partner with other functions and delivering value to the enterprise, she believes more trust will be generated with business partners than by merely talking loudly without substance. “It’s about coming to the table, understanding business needs and delivering.”</p>
<p>Of course, different treasurers will draw upon different personal resources to keep ahead of the curve. Kristen makes frequent reference to what she feels is the best piece of advice she has been given in her career so far, dispensed by a former senior colleague at Caterpillar: “It’s a marathon not a sprint, so enjoy the run”. When you’re young and eager, she comments, you are always in a hurry to climb to the next rung. “The moment of epiphany is when you realise that it is not all going to be over when you reach the next position.” Whilst she is a firm believer that it is good to embrace learning opportunities along the career path and to extract as much as possible from each experience, it is essential also that family and friends fit equitably into the equation. “If you can do that in your career, you can grow with it and have fun”.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p><i>For someone who was attracted to treasury by the complexity of the function, L’Oréal UK’s Jessica McDarren is not one to shy away from the relentless pace and intricacies of the work. In this interview, Jessica talks about the role of self-belief in treasury and importance of a constructive working environment.</i></p>

<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Jessica McDarren</h4>
<h5 class="title">Treasurer</h5>
<br/>
<img alt="L’Oréal UK and Ireland" class="logo org" height="28" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/loreal-uk-and-ireland-logo-2014-120x28.png" width="120"/>
<br/>
<p>Jessica McDarren started her accounting career straight from secondary school when she joined a small Chartered Accounting firm in Ayrshire, Scotland as Trainee Accountant. She immediately realised that accountancy was to be her future. She moved on to larger organisations while continuing with her accountancy studies. In 2005 Jessica joined a rapidly growing digital media agency as Financial Controller. This was a part-time role as she now had a young toddler to care for as well as her CIMA studies to progress.</p>
<p>In March 2009 Jessica became a fully qualified CIMA member following four years of weekend and evening study and was promoted to the full-time role of Head of Finance. It was at this time that Jessica was awarded Young Accountant of the Year by Accountancy Age. The judges said “[she] made the role her own while showing great tenacity and determination to achieve many things at once”.</p>
<p>In 2010 Jessica joined L’Oréal as Commercial Controller. After two and half successful years in this role Jessica decided to broaden her knowledge of the business and joined Corporate Finance as Treasurer for L’Oréal UK and Ireland. In August 2012 she re-located with her husband and two sons to South Wales.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="respond-differently-needs-of-treasury">Do you feel that women respond differently to the needs of treasury?</h5>
<p>I don’t feel that there is a huge difference in the way that women and men respond to treasury issues. Different personalities do bring different skills and ideas to the role, though. That’s why I think it is really important in business to have diversity within a team. In my experience having a good mix of backgrounds, experience and gender can often be the difference between a team being successful or not.</p>
<h5 id="biggest-challenge-as-a-corporate-treasurer">What is the biggest challenge you are facing right now as a corporate treasurer?</h5>
<p>One of the biggest challenges for me in my role now is time. I naturally get very excited about new projects and initiatives and ideas. But there’s only the same number of hours in every day, so I have to be realistic. Juggling multiple projects and responsibilities can be challenging, but it just comes down to knowing your priorities and good time management.</p>
<h5 id="balance-between-professional-and-family-life">Is the business work progressing in the right direction in addressing the balance between professional and family life?</h5>
<p>I think it is moving in the right direction. More than ever companies are thinking seriously about how they can support their employees achieve a good work-life balance. L’Oréal, for example, introduced a Work Smart initiative which gives employees great flexibility to manage their working hours. And that is to the benefit of companies as well, not just employees.</p>
<p>Often what companies find is that by offering employees greater flexibility around how they manage their working patterns with their personal life, they are helping them to be more effective.</p>
<p>It’s also quite important to remember that, for women, the work-life balance is not always about commitments to their immediate family, but can also involve the wider family too, such as looking after elderly parents and other such responsibilities.</p>
<h5 id="tool-that-could-make-you-an-even-better-treasurer">If there was one tool that could make you an even better treasurer, what would it be?</h5>
<p>I wouldn’t say that there is one specific tool out there that would change everything for us. But as a team we are constantly looking to improve the tools we are already using. That is one of the great things about L’Oréal: being in an environment where you actually have the opportunity to say how you want to see things develop and work on improving the processes and tools that you are using in the company.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">

<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>It was complexity that first attracted Jessica to treasury. Having begun her career as an accountant for a small medium-sized enterprise (SME), Jessica landed her first corporate role in 2010 when she joined L’Oréal UK and Ireland to work as a commercial controller for its L’Oréal Paris brand. Her first venture into a corporate environment proved to be a very enjoyable experience, but after two years she began to yearn for a new challenge.</p>
<p>Treasury, with all its complexities, seemed ideal in that respect. “I wanted to improve my knowledge of the wider company and acquire a different perspective,” she says. “So I decided that it was the perfect time to move into corporate finance – to get that exposure to the whole company and across all the different brands.”</p>
<p>L’Oréal offered Jessica a new role in the company and soon she found herself leaving London and relocating to South Wales with her husband and two children to work at the group’s finance shared service centre (SSC). With the responsibilities and reach of her new position in treasury Jessica now found herself exactly where she wanted to be – right at the heart of the business. But was she daunted by the relentless pace and complexity of the work? Not in the slightest. In fact, they are both elements of the job that she has strongly embraced. “What I love about working in treasury is that it’s so fast paced and, even more, that I have the opportunity to work across all of our 29 brands,” she says. “They all have different personalities and I like the variety that brings to what I do on a daily basis. That is what I really thrive on and enjoy.”</p>
<p>Managing such a broad scope of responsibilities requires a great deal of self-belief, of course. The advice Jessica received when she began her treasury role served her well though. “I was told that the key to success in treasury is to listen to your instincts and, more importantly, having the confidence to act upon them,” she says. “If you see a process that you feel could be improved don’t hesitate, but work to improve it. Likewise, if you have a great idea, then suggest it.” The culture at L’Oréal is, she says, very encouraging in that respect. “I think that is where I am fortunate to be working in the environment that I am. Our ethos here is that nothing is impossible and that means we do have an opportunity to try new things and move the department forward.”</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">

<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>But what about the wider business? Does Jessica feel that treasury’s voice is heard throughout the organisation? That is a vital part of her work, she explains. At a fundamental level if the treasurer is not communicating with other divisions within the organisation then everything from straight-through processing rates to the timing of cash flows can suffer. But she also believes that taking a pro-active approach and engaging with other areas of the business is about much more than that. It can also give treasurers a chance to really make a difference in the company. “I think that is where we can really add value,” she says. “When you’re connected with the business and you are working with the brands or divisions then you really have an opportunity to shape new processes and come up with ideas on how to improve things going forward.”</p>
<p>That, perhaps, underscores Jessica’s approach to the treasury role. “For me the one thing that is never going to change is change,” she says. “In the business world you can either be a driver of change or you can be a passenger.” Jessica, quite evidently, falls into the former category.</p></div>

<p>Karen Van den Driessche is Treasury Director EMEA at Avnet, a role she has held since 2011. She is also Vice President of the Belgian Association of Corporate Treasurers. After spending two years at ING (former BBL) she started her career in treasury at Solutia as Treasury Assistant in 1997 where she was responsible for setting up a treasury management system and ensuring the recently spun-off company got its treasury department up and running. She moved to Coca-Cola Enterprises in 2001 as Treasury Analyst and was promoted to Treasury Manager Europe in 2003. After a five-month placement at Agfa Gevaert as Corporate Treasurer she subsequently moved to AB Inbev in 2008 as Treasury Director Western Europe where she took on additional responsibilities in working capital management, insurance and pension fund management before being promoted to Director Global Cash and Liquidity in 2009.</p>

<h5 id="is-the-business-world-progressing-in-the-right-direction-in-addressing-the-balance-between-professional-and-family-life">Is the business world progressing in the right direction in addressing the balance between professional and family life?</h5>
<p>I think technology has provided us with the tools to be able to balance professional and family life, although this creates an additional challenge. With technology we can always be connected, which may tip the balance in the wrong direction. I think it is important for everyone to set their personal boundaries and to take a conscious decision about what they will or won’t do, as this balance is different for everyone. I have always been very lucky to work for organisations where there has been a lot of flexibility. But flexibility is based on trust, and this needs to be earned, on both sides. Progress is being made in the business world, although I am still amazed to hear that some organisations value mere physical presence in the workplace from nine to five over more concrete output.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-the-biggest-challenge-you-are-facing-now-as-a-corporate-treasurer">What is the biggest challenge you are facing now as a corporate treasurer?</h5>
<p>We have put in place a number of initiatives to bring our treasury to the next level, which makes life very challenging. For example, there is the global implementation of a new TMS (for which I am the global business lead); SWIFT connectivity; bank rationalisation from 50+ banks to six; and the subsequent preparation of a payment factory implementation. Combined with the changes and additional requirements in the regulatory environment, and finding and keeping the right level of skilled employees, it is safe to say that life is not boring in our treasury.</p>
<h5 id="do-you-see-a-day-when-there-will-be-true-equality-in-the-workplace">Do you see a day when there will be true equality in the workplace, at all levels?</h5>
<p>If true equality means that each person gets to decide what they want to do and are not hindered by preconceived ideas of what women and men are supposed to bring to society, then I’m not sure, although I do hope so. It may take a while – but it is important that women want this to happen. I think that very often we, as women, are our own worst enemies by confirming time and again the gender cliché of women having children and staying at home.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-the-best-piece-of-advice-that-you-have-been-given-in-your-career-so-far">What is the best piece of advice that you have been given in your career so far?</h5>
<p>Be yourself (but be politically correct), work hard and deliver. But beyond this it is important to exchange ideas, network and not to get stuck in your ivory “treasury” tower. There are so many smart and interesting people and ideas out there – you need to make sure you get to interact with them and learn from them. This means never declining an interesting challenge or opportunity, even if it takes you out of your comfort zone – indeed, that is how I got into treasury in the first place.</p>
<h5 id="which-regulatory-initiative-is-currently-the-biggest-concern-for-your-treasury-department">Which regulatory initiative is currently the biggest concern for your treasury department?</h5>
<p>The biggest regulatory concern for us is Basel III which is increasing the cost of banking and EMIR. We are reporting trades for EMIR but there is still a real lack of clarity about the requirements and fines.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>“I ended up in treasury by accident,” says Karen Van den Driessche. After two years in banking, Karen joined US agrochemical group Monsanto as a credit and collections specialist. At the time, Monsanto was spinning off its chemical division, and the company’s finance director asked Karen to join the EMEA treasury of the newly formed entity. After finding herself in the profession, she has never looked back.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know much about what the treasury function entailed, but it sounded interesting and challenging so I took the chance,” says Karen. “Fortunately it is an area I thoroughly enjoy, and I have learned a lot and met a lot of interesting and inspiring people. It continues to be a challenging and ever-changing environment.”</p>
<p>And despite her ascent to her current position, Karen believes there remains scope for career progression within her role.</p>
<p>“There are still a lot of opportunities for me in my current role. I currently have responsibility for EMEA, but I would certainly be interested in taking on more regional and even global responsibilities,” she says. There are, she adds, still areas where she does not yet have the same depth of experience, such as corporate finance and working capital management, which she would like to explore further.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote>I work very, very hard but I enjoy what I do. People sometimes call me a workaholic but as I enjoy what I do, I don’t really consider it work.</blockquote>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h3 id="voice-your-opinion">Voice your opinion</h3>
<p>But how do corporate treasurers go about climbing the career ladder? “It is important to voice your opinion, to share your interests and achievements, and to work hard and be visible,” says Karen. “I am fortunate that the organisation I work for seems to appreciate this and takes it into account. Furthermore, Avnet has recently started focusing more on internal talent, which I think should help me as well.”</p>
<p>She is a firm believer that women add value to the treasury department in a way that their male counterparts do not. “I think that everyone brings something different based on their personality and drive, regardless of gender. But I do believe that women approach things differently than men; they take things more personally and feel the need to over-deliver in order to be considered equal to men. Thanks to this trait they are more attentive to the bigger picture and look at other options in the long term.” She adds that women are often less encumbered than men by their egos in getting their job done, “although, of course, there are always exceptions!”</p>
<p>Her motto in life reflects the ‘fun factor’ she applies to her job. “Enjoy life to the fullest – have fun in what you do and do it well,” she says. “I work very, very hard but I enjoy what I do. People sometimes call me a workaholic but as I enjoy what I do, I don’t really consider it work.”</p>
<p>For treasurers – male and female – who struggle to make their voice heard within the organisation, Karen has a word of advice. “Come up with ideas that support the business and show your added-value. Be visible and be interested in what is really happening in the company.” And it appears that Karen has done just that in her career in treasury so far.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p><i>“If you’re going to do something, do it right,” says Shelly Maneth, CFO at technology startup ConneXionsAsia. Here she explains how her ‘never regret’ attitude not only brought her from the US to Singapore, but also drives the way she manages the development of CXA’s finance function.</i></p>
<i></i><br/>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Shelly Maneth</h4>
<h5 class="title">CFO</h5>
<img alt="ConneXionsAsia" class="logo org" height="45" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/connexionsasia-logo-2014-65x45.png" width="65"/>
<p>Shelly Maneth is the CFO of ConneXionsAsia (CXA), an employee benefits start-up based in Singapore. In addition to building a Regional Finance team with scalable systems and processes as well as supporting the integration of the Pan Group, Singapore’s largest home grown broker and a recent acquisition for CXA, Shelly also manages investor funding for the development and expansion of CXA throughout the region.</p>
<p>Shelly’s career spans 22 years, with 20 of those in the Asia Pacific region. During her career, she has taken on a variety of senior regional finance roles for multinational companies such as Cisco Systems, Sony Pictures Entertainment, PropertyGuru.com, Deloitte, Oliver Wyman and most recently AT Kearney.</p>
<p>Shelly is a US CPA, holding two degrees – BS in Accounting and Business Administration from University of Kansas. She is particularly passionate about education and has served on Boards and Audit Committees of various international schools in Singapore including United World College of South East Asia and the German European School of Singapore.</p>

<h5 id="do-you-feel-that-women-respond-to-the-needs-of-treasury-in-the-same-way-that-men-do">Do you feel that women respond to the needs of treasury in the same way that men do?</h5>
<p>No, I believe that naturally men and women will respond to almost anything differently; it’s simply in our DNA. In general, unless a man’s EQ is quite high, men tend to adopt a more direct approach when it comes to finance/treasury decisions while women tend to adopt a more inquisitive and lateral approach. Ultimately, we will more than likely reach a similar conclusion, but our approach can be quite different.</p>
<h5 id="is-the-business-world-progressing-in-the-right-direction">Balancing professional and family life is tricky – is the business world progressing in the right direction?</h5>
<p>This balance between professional and family life is becoming more challenging for both men and women. Traditionally, it has been the woman’s role to manage the family and if she could balance her career while doing that, she was a Super Woman. This traditional role for women still exists today. However, in companies and cultures where the equality gap between men and women is narrowing, roles and responsibilities have changed or have been forced to recalibrate, especially in dual-income households – although, admittedly, the woman still carries a disproportionate amount of the responsibilities!</p>
<h5 id="what-is-the-biggest-challenge-you-are-facing-now">What is the biggest challenge you are facing now, as a woman in a male-dominated sector?</h5>
<p>Some of the business sectors I have worked in tend to be male-dominated, such as technology and consulting. I handled it by ignoring the gender aspect of my role. I truly believe the best qualified, most competent person should fill a role, regardless of gender, race, religion, sexual orientation and so on. I respect gender differences, but in the Finance sector, my view is gender has little bearing on performance or effectiveness, as long as the management and culture of a company truly support hiring the best qualified people for a role.</p>
<h5 id="do-you-see-a-day-when-we-will-have-true-equality-in-the-workplace">Do you see a day when we will have true equality in the workplace, at all levels?</h5>
<p>Honestly, and sadly, not in my lifetime. I believe equality in the workplace is improving, but even in the most progressive countries, companies or cultures, there is still inequality on a variety of levels. However, this does not stop me from removing inequality within the organisations I work in, or in how I interact with others.</p>
<h5 id="which-regulatory-initiative-is-currently-the-biggest-concern-for-you-right-now">In pure treasury terms, which regulatory initiative is currently the biggest concern for you right now?</h5>
<p>Having joined a start-up, my biggest concern in treasury regulation is currently dictated largely by investors in our company – whether locally or overseas. Having said that, and having worked with MNC’s historically, a treasury regulation I find truly over-the-top is the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). It would behove the US Department of Treasury and the IRS to spend time with their counterparts in Singapore to understand the efficiency and simplification, yet transparency, Singapore achieves with much less administration and onus.</p></div>

<p class="quote-block__source"></p>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>“Finance and accounting was a natural path for me,” says Shelly Maneth, CFO of Singapore-based employee benefits start-up, ConneXionsAsia (CXA). She may admit to being a “stereotypical accountant” to whom numbers come easy, but she feels her true strength lies with problem-solving and organisational management. Thus it is after more than 20 years working for firms such as Deloitte, Cisco Systems, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Oliver Wyman, AT Kearney and, currently CXA, she proclaims that “I couldn’t be happier with my career choice”. And there is still “immense opportunity” for career progression. Indeed, she notes, as part of a progressive start-up “infinite possibilities will avail themselves”.</p>
<p>Positioning oneself to take advantage of such a broad scope requires a broad outlook. To this effect, Shelly considers some of the best advice she ever received was from an unexpected source. “My husband and I were so focused on the arrival of our first child that during one of our last appointments prior to the birth, our doctor stopped our conversation and said: ‘You know, the birth is a moment in time. Whilst it is important, you should focus on your life as parents because this will last a lifetime.’” At first hearing this sounds far removed from career advice, but it does translate easily to Shelly’s professional life. “When a key decision is being discussed, I look hard at the foundation on which that decision will be supported, because that foundation will need to support that decision for a ‘lifetime’.”</p>
<p>Of course, the doctor’s advice still holds true as a parent; a role which can sometimes be very difficult to balance with professional life. In the Maneth household, Shelly and her husband have agreed both will be ‘involved’ parents, sharing the responsibilities for raising their children and managing the household. Much of the ability to balance life for many working parents, she feels, can be attributed to the adoption of technology. “In today’s world, regardless of your role, there’s more flexibility in terms of where and when we work. Technology, though, has also forced a change within traditional family roles, including our children’s, who are now expected to be a bit more independent and knowledgeable of the world around them than I was at their age.”</p>
<p>In her professional life, perhaps one of the most useful ‘tools’ Shelly would like is access to a simplified, common banking platform (as would most treasurers). Relationships with multiple banks, for example, typically means multiple login tokens. “Often the bank has to spend at least a couple of hours supporting your understanding of how their platform works. Then, as your needs or organisational structure change, you have multiple systems to update. This all seems unnecessarily challenging.”</p>
<p>Of course, challenges are par for the course at the executive end of the corporate finance spectrum. With Shelly currently building the foundation of finance at CXA, having the opportunity to set it all in motion is a lot easier working alongside “incredibly talented and smart team members”. The set-up is not without its challenges, though still “exhilarating”. Having worked in a male-dominated role such as treasury as well as male dominated sectors such as IT and consultancy, Shelly has learnt to “ignore the gender aspect” and instead focus on her own belief that the best qualified, most competent person should fill a role, regardless of factors such as gender, race, religion or sexual orientation. CXA has a diverse management team, led by Founder and CEO, Rosaline Koo, and together they have cultivated “a great working environment, with minimal politics and bureaucracy”.</p>
<p>When everyone is allowed their voice, treasury and finance is heard throughout the organisation. But Shelly knows this is not the case everywhere. “Treasury and finance people need to be able to clearly articulate the value of their role to the wider business, not necessarily by beating it into peoples’ heads, rather making poignant statements subtly.” With the common perception that treasury and finance are ‘cost centres’, she often takes the opportunity, in routine conversations or presentations “to sneak in a finance achievement that would otherwise be unknown to the organisation”. Key to this is the art of establishing and maintaining relationships outside of the finance team, moving out of one’s comfort zone and understanding other departments or facets of the business. “Basically, get out there and talk to people in your organisation!”</p>
<p>This sounds like a motto for Shelly but her guiding principles continue to evolve over the years. “Growing up, my father instilled in my siblings and me that ‘if you’re going to do something, do it right’. In my mid-20s to mid-30s, I lived to ‘never regret’ which is what brought me to Singapore. And whilst I still live by those two principles, I now strive to be ‘respectfully genuine’ in everything that I do.” Inspiration, she adds, comes from living life “with an open heart, open eyes and an open mind, with my husband, children, parents and friends integral to the fabric of my being”.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><i>More than 130 attendees gathered at Raffles Hotel in Singapore on 8<sup>th</sup> May 2014 for Treasury Today’s inaugural Women in Treasury Asia Forum. The lively and thought provoking event began with a networking reception during which an introduction to the Women in Treasury initiative and highlights of the Women in Treasury Study were presented by Angela Berry, Publisher, Treasury Today and Sophie Jackson, Associate Publisher, Treasury Today Asia.</i></p>
<i></i><br/><p>This was followed by the lunch during which an ‘all-star’ panel discussion took place with four highly respected women from the treasury industry. The speakers were:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Meena Dafesh, Director of Treasury, Asia Pacific and MEA, Ingram Micro</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jeanette Chang, Treasurer, Asia Pacific, IBM</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dianne Challenor, Head of Transaction Services, Asia Pacific, J.P. Morgan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anne Collard, Global Head of Corporate Product Management, ANZ</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>During the debate, four key topics highlighted by the study formed the themes for a lively and dynamic panel discussion. This was followed by a question and answer session, with challenging and interesting views raised from the audience. The topics were:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Job satisfaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mentoring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vive la différence.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Although each panellist certainly had their own personal views on these topics and on how women can add value to the treasury profession, there were several extremely noteworthy pieces of advice upon which all the panellists agreed. First and foremost, that women (and indeed men) must be forthcoming to get what they really want from their career. Whether they need greater support to be their best at work; require a mentor to help with their development; or they want to be considered for a promotion or a pay rise; treasury professionals should not be afraid to ask for what they want or need – they should not expect their manager to be a mind reader, or that opportunities will be presented to them on a plate.</p>
<p>Finding a sponsor within your organisation, someone to suggest you for a responsibility or project, someone to champion you in meetings, was another useful tip to emerge from the panel session. Aside from sponsors, role models are also extremely important in career development – be they men or women, within the organisation or external.</p>
<p>Other key takeaways from the discussion included the need for all of us to be aware of our unconscious bias. We all are susceptible to unconscious bias and as individuals we need to put these aside when hiring or promoting – this should not just concern gender diversity, but all forms of diversity from age to race.</p>
<p>Interestingly, despite the significant amount of unconscious bias that exists in the industry, the panel largely agreed that quotas are not the answer to getting more senior women into the treasury profession. The consensus was that organisations can do more to encourage female treasury practitioners to think long-term about their careers and mentoring was cited as a key enabler here. Similarly, the panel felt that women should try to more consciously self-promote: often women are reluctant to talk positively about their own achievements or feel that they are not qualified enough for senior positions. Men, on the other hand, are generally better at self-promotion and self-belief, which can see them moving up the career ladder ahead of female candidates. As Patricia Lim, GTS Product Head Cash Asia, International Banking, RBS noted after the event: “if you believe in yourself, everything is possible.”</p>
<h3 id="breaking-down-barriers">Breaking down barriers</h3>
<p>There is a still a need to remove the stigma associated with flexible working arrangements for both genders, the panel believed. This not only means educating managers on the benefits of remote working, for example, but also working to break down cultural barriers and perceptions. Often, employees feel they are made to feel guilty for taking time off work to look after their family. Similarly, there is often little done for women who are returning to work from a HR point of view. Organisations should offer guidance around how to re-adjust to being a working mother and guidance as to how to take your career forward, the panel felt.</p>
<p>But time outside the office shouldn’t just be about family. As Lauren Oakes from Goldman Sachs who was in the audience commented: “the term work-life balance seems to have become synonymous with marriage and children and we need to change that. Everyone deserves to have an enriching life outside of the office and an opportunity to pursue their interests. For me, it is often when I am doing something completely unrelated to work that I am able to solve the most complex and challenging work related issues. Having time to reflect is critical.”</p>
<h3 id="positive-and-progressive">Positive and progressive</h3>
<p>The overall messages from the panel were extremely positive and highlighted the need for diversity in the treasury profession. Abed Islam from BNP Paribas, one of a number of men who also attended the event commented: “I was pleased to hear the panel members’ perspectives on how women these days are increasingly capable of striking the right work-life balance, while simultaneously focusing on career progression and leading by example.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is still a great need for initiatives supporting women in the treasury profession. As Oakes noted: “There is an African proverb that says “If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together”. If we want to change some of the structural issues, namely having more women in the most senior positions, we will have to ‘go together’ and that everyone must play a part. These types of initiatives are a great starting point as they bring awareness to the challenges women face and also inspire others to get more involved with mentoring and sponsoring junior women within their organisations.</p>
<p>We would like to thank all those who took part in, attended and supported our inaugural Women in Treasury Asia Forum and would like to invite all other women and men in the industry who are interested or intrigued by the initiative to take part in our future events. The <a href="/women-in-treasury/study">2014 Women in Treasury Study</a>, which is supported by RBS, is also now open. This aims to build up a global picture of the profiles and careers of women from junior roles to Group Treasurer/Financial Director/CFO positions.</p>
<p>This year’s inaugural Adam Smith Awards Asia are now open for nominations until 12<sup>th</sup> September 2014 and we are delighted to announce the category of ‘Woman of the Year’ as part of the awards. This award is open to any woman operating in the corporate treasury environment in the Asia Pacific region who can demonstrate real achievement and is an inspiration to others. Do you know someone like this? Someone who is a role model to others? Or is this you? Have you overcome real adversity? Have you had a career changing experience? Can you demonstrate real innovation? What have you achieved professionally and personally? Why do you stand out? <a href="/asia/adamsmith">Nominate</a> yourself or another woman who inspires you.</p>
<div class="boxed">
<h3 id="treasury-today-women-in-treasury">Treasury Today Women in Treasury</h3>
<p>Launched at the beginning of 2013, Treasury Today’s Women in Treasury initiative recognises the importance of women in the corporate treasury profession and creates a means for women in treasury to communicate with one another; learn from each other and network in order to help each other.</p>
<p>Whilst the treasury profession remains largely male-dominated, there are remarkable women enjoying remarkable careers. The Women in Treasury initiative recognises female innovators in the corporate treasury profession.</p>
<p>Women need to be much more visible in their roles, both inside and outside of their organisation. While women are notoriously bad at promoting themselves, this initiative aims to help bridge the gap. We frequently profile female trendsetters in Treasury Today Asia. Each article looks at professional development and career-defining moments, as well as providing advice to those just starting out in the profession. We also host a Women in Treasury LinkedIn group – to join this group email <a href="mailto:sarah.arter@treasurytoday.com">sarah.arter@treasurytoday.com</a></p>

<p>Jennifer Ramsey-Armorer is the Treasurer at BlackBerry, and oversees the company’s global Cash Management and Foreign Exchange functions, focusing on strategy, policies and process improvements. She is responsible for the Investment Portfolio for BlackBerry, managing all FX exposure (current and forecast) as well as Corporate Banking, Settlements and Global Payments. Jennifer is a graduate of the University of Waterloo and has been a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) charterholder since 1993 and a Certified Treasury Professional (CTP) since 2007. Prior to joining BlackBerry, she was Director, Treasury Operations at Mutual Life Insurance, Treasury Manager at Hatch Ltd (Engineering), and a Financial Analyst at MDS Inc.</p>

<h5 id="what-is-your-motto-in-life">What is your motto in life?</h5>
<p>Be excellent at what you do. I aim for excellence in all aspects of my life – as a mother, a wife, an employee, a manager and a boss. I work every day to balance all of these roles and be at my best in all of them.</p>
<h5 id="which-single-tool-enables-you-to-achieve-precisely-that-level-of-excellence-in-your-role">Which single tool enables you to achieve precisely that level of excellence in your role?</h5>
<p>My BlackBerry! I would say that even if I didn’t work for the company – I don’t know how I would function without it. Whether by email, phone, or WebEx, my BlackBerry really is the essential tool to help me stay on top of tasks and communicate with my team and stakeholders around the world.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-the-biggest-regulatory-concern-facing-the-treasury-profession-right-now">In your view, what is the biggest regulatory concern facing the treasury profession right now?</h5>
<p>One challenge that I know a number of treasurers have navigated is the central banks in various markets. I’m fortunate to have experts that help us manage the regulatory requirements in each market where we operate, but I do know the industry is impacted by the many changes happening around the world.</p>
<h5 id="what-would-you-say-is-your-biggest-business-challenge-as-treasurer-of-blackberry">What would you say is your biggest business challenge as treasurer of BlackBerry?</h5>
<p>Given the public perception of the challenges our company has faced, the most difficult thing this past year is our ability to get credit, and make sure we have enough credit available to transact in global markets. As in most organisations, a challenge for us is always managing the cash flow and the credit of the company. Payment fraud is, and always will be, a treasury challenge, as the criminals get more creative and more technically sophisticated. Since we deal with 43 different currencies, we also have to keep up with varying foreign exchange regulations and reporting requirements, which can be time-consuming and complex, but we have a great team to help manage this.</p>
<h5 id="how-can-treasurers-do-more-to-make-their-voice-heard-in-an-organisation">How can treasurers do more to make their voice heard in an organisation?</h5>
<p>Treasurers should ask, ‘What’s the risk of not being vocal and taking action?’ I think it’s important to identify what the risks are, create awareness of them through clear communication that sets up a business case and recommendation, and then take action. In order to be heard, treasurers should also have good judgment and earn trust in their CFOs. I’m fortunate that my CFO is very accessible by BBM (BlackBerry Messenger), and has solid knowledge of treasury and understanding about risk. He also trusts my judgment – if I tell him the sky is falling, he knows I mean it.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>“It’s been interesting,” says Jennifer Ramsey-Armorer when describing her career path. And it is fair to say that she didn’t necessarily take a traditional path to the role of treasurer. In fact, Jennifer started in music, studying jazz as a vocal major and an instrumental minor at Humber College in Toronto. Despite her obvious passion for all things musical, Jennifer’s head for numbers soon kicked in: “I got all the way through, earned my degree, and realised that I’d never make enough money to survive.” It was time to look for a more stable way to earn a living.</p>
<p>“My first job was as a receptionist in a small Trust company. This was before electronic money transfers, and one of my tasks was handling cheques coming into the organisation. The day I held a $2,000,000 cheque was the day I decided that wherever that cheque came from, that’s where I wanted to work,” she quips. So Jennifer went directly to that department, and by chance fell into a treasury role – one of their employees was about to go on maternity leave, and they needed someone right away.</p>
<p>After stepping into the role with unexpected ease, Jennifer found that the learning curve was steep – not having a business background and trying to find her way in an industry she didn’t know well was always going to be a challenge. “It was suggested that I get a formal financial education, and for the next three years, working and with a small child at home, I earned my CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) designation in 1993 from The CFA Institute,” she says. The hard work certainly paid off. Over the next nine years, Jennifer moved up in the field of treasury and took up the reins as Director of Treasury at Mutual Life of Canada, which eventually became Sun Life Canada.</p></div>

<p class="quote-block__source"></p>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Keen to continue expanding her horizons, from 2002 to 2005 Jennifer earned a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Waterloo, which was located right across the street from what was then the original Research in Motion (RIM) campus, known today as BlackBerry. “I decided to take a bit of a break from work while enrolled in school, and worked part-time as a consultant at RIM in the early years. In fact, I helped set up BlackBerry’s treasury function. When my contract ended, I moved on to treasury roles at several other organisations – MDS (medical devices) and Hatch (engineering) over the next five years,” Jennifer explains. But then, in 2009, RIM reached out to her. “I returned full circle to the company as Director of Treasury, and have been enjoying every day since,” she enthuses.</p>
<h3 id="staying-true">Staying true</h3>
<p>As well as loving the company she works for, Jennifer finds herself motivated by the many and varied challenges presented by the treasury role itself. “In my opinion, treasury is the more interesting side of finance – it’s not just accounting; it’s credit analysis and investments, foreign exchange trading, quantitative analysis, risk tolerance and cash management – very compelling and crucial responsibilities.”</p>
<p>Another interesting challenge to the treasury role, as Jennifer sees it, is the fact that the industry remains so male-dominated. “Fewer than 10 percent of the senior positions in this field are occupied by women. And unless more of us get to that level, it’s difficult for younger women to have a mentor they recognise near the top of their field of choice, someone they can see and relate to with a ‘Wow, look at her, I bet I could do that, too’.</p>
<p>“I look around the table at our CFO’s regular meetings, and I recognise that women have progressed much further since the 1980s, but in a lot of ways we’re still a long way from equality.” Often in the minority at external finance conferences or networking events as well, Jennifer says that it’s hard to know how to change the status quo. “I’ve actually been told – by a man – that if I want to succeed in business, I need to learn to play golf to ‘fit in’. Honestly, I’ve gotten over trying to be what men want or expect me to be – I’m the person that I need to be. And for me, that means I’ll go to yoga class instead of going to play golf. But I’m happy with that choice and, at least so far, it’s worked out pretty well for me.”</p>
<h3 id="throwing-down-the-gauntlet">Throwing down the gauntlet</h3>
<p>Nevertheless, Jennifer is keen to challenge the industry – and professional women – to think about how we can set up future generations of women for success. Part of that will involve recognising gender differences and playing to them as strengths, not weaknesses, she says. For example, “I definitely believe women bring something different to a treasury role. Women in general approach problems differently than men do; we collaborate well, and we aren’t afraid to ask questions. Men and women bring different life experiences into the workplace, and it’s those experiences that cause them to see both problems and solutions in complementary ways.”</p>
<p>Proactively and openly talking about balancing professional and personal life will also be key to enabling more women to be successful – and to take on senior roles, believes Jennifer. “We can’t hide from the fact that women are the child bearers, and finding the balance between professional and personal life can be difficult.” Jennifer is based in Canada, where parents are afforded an entire year off for maternity – or paternity – leave, and it can be split between each parent. “I’ve seen more and more people taking advantage of this arrangement, with the male taking more of a parenting role. In my case, my husband and I shared parenting responsibilities as much as possible – and certainly more than my parents ever did,” she notes.</p>
<p>But even though home life may be evolving to cater more towards working women’s lives, after mothers return to work, maintaining that balance is a challenge. Says Jennifer: “As women achieve more senior positions and better pay, nannies or home care givers can be an option. But if you don’t start in those senior positions, if you are working your way up in a career with small children at home, it’s tough to put in long days at work and still have the time and energy to devote to your family.”</p>
<h3 id="sharing-knowledge">Sharing knowledge</h3>
<p>So what advice does Jennifer have for women aspiring to the higher treasury ranks, and how does she put this into action within her own team? “The role of treasurer is probably as high as you’ll go in this profession. I got all the way here, having really started from the very bottom, so I have great appreciation for every person on my team – their contributions and their career aspirations, as well as the expectations they have of me to lead them and help them grow.</p>
<p>“I emphasise cross-training on my team. Every person becomes more valuable when they not only know their own role, but they also understand how others impact the team. Someone in banking should also understand cash management; FX traders need to understand investments and interest rate swaps. That’s the biggest thing I encourage people to do – don’t just do your job, try to learn more about what others do and how that makes you a better employee,” she advises.</p>
<p>Finally, from a leadership perspective, making sure you’re hiring the right people is vital not only to the company’s success but to your personal success too, says Jennifer. “If my boss trusts me in making decisions, I need to trust my team in making decisions – I need to be able to rely on them as much as my boss relies on me.” And in her role at BlackBerry, it certainly seems that Jennifer can do just that.</p></div>

<h5 class="title">Group Treasurer, Plan International</h5>

<br/>
<p>As Group Treasurer of Plan International, Annemarie has developed a central treasury function that services the NGOs 50 programme countries and a turnover of approximately €700m in multiple currencies. In her time at Plan she has devised and implemented appropriate currency management and rationalised banking across Africa and Asia for the organisation. At any one time Plan’s treasury manages between €120m and €160 equivalent of multicurrencies. The Treasury function that she has implemented has been highlighted in reports by Stamp Out Poverty and Better FX as ‘best practice’ regarding foreign exchange. The rationalising of banking that Annemarie implemented was a case study in Treasury Today in November 2011. Annemarie is on the Overseas Special Interest Group steering committee and the Treasury Special Interest Group committee of the CFG (Charity Finance Group) plus a member a of the Association of Development Organisations Treasures in the US. She has most recently implemented a Treasury Management system in Plan which she describes as a ‘labour of love in that what you put into it is what you get out and I really want to see great efficiencies by using the system.’ Within Plan she is a member of the Senior Finance Leadership Team. Prior to joining Plan Annemarie worked in an arm of Lehman Bros in securitisation, was a Treasury consultant and also Treasurer of a merchant bank.</p>

<h5 id="how-important-is-it-to-have-a-supportive-employer">Maintaining a balance between one’s professional and personal life can be tricky – how important is it to have a supportive employer?</h5>
<p>Like most organisations today, my current company offers dependency leave. Since I commute and the school which my youngest child attends is too far for me to leave and then come back, having an employer who is happy for me to work from home on occasion is a real benefit. That said, it can sometimes be difficult to apply flexible hours within the treasury profession, given the various time zones, dealing deadlines and payment cut-off times.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-the-biggest-treasury-challenge-you-are-facing-right-now">What is the biggest treasury challenge you are facing right now?</h5>
<p>The raft of regulatory changes we’ve seen over the past five years – particularly for derivatives – is the most significant challenge I and other treasurers are facing at the moment. Under EMIR, for instance, corporates are liable as well as financial institutions, yet corporates don’t necessarily have the infrastructure and the management information systems (MIS) that banks have to help them carry out the reporting. In addition, the quantity of obligations and uncertainty over implementation has been burdensome. At Plan we use financial instruments for managing currency exposure but have had to implement regulation without increasing our overheads. Being an NGO we are mindful of costs.</p>
<p>Having said that, Dodd Frank and EMIR are now very current, so the workload on implementation is generally behind us in the treasury sector. The remaining ongoing challenge is finding yield in a risk averse manner in the Basel III and low interest rate environment.</p>
<h5 id="what-can-treasurers-do-to-get-their-voices-heard-within-an-organisation">What can treasurers do to get their voices heard within an organisation?</h5>
<p>There is a triangle of flow here, relationships, knowledge and communication. From relationships one can understand the issues and latest strategy, which is knowledge. The knowledge provides opportunity to add value, to change. And the communication piece is the proposal followed by marketing for which one can fall back on relationships.</p>
<p>For my part, I do quite a lot of internal and external presentations. When there has been external change such as the euro collapse a few years ago or the advent of Dodd Frank, I have written papers for circulation internally to relevant management and for the Board, with regular revisions. In addition, as and when there are appropriate opportunities, I draw attention to the department’s challenges and achievements.</p>
<h5 id="who-has-been-your-greatest-career-inspiration">Who has been your greatest career inspiration?</h5>
<p>I was greatly influenced by my mentor from many years ago when I was a junior dealer in a bank. My treasurer at the time was a gentleman who decided I was going places and he took me under his wing to make sure that I did, I guess. He provided the environment for me to learn and broaden my experiences and for me to move the dealing room into further attractive and profitable areas. His parting words to me when he handed the Treasurer reins to me were, “you don’t need to know everything, just know who to go to.”</p></div>

<blockquote>His parting words when he handed the Treasurer reins to me were, ‘you don’t need to know everything, just know who to go to’.</blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source"></p>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>In the early years of her career, Annemarie Moore worked in the back office at several international banking institutions, but always aspired to be one of the dealers or front office team. Taking on her first role as a treasurer at a merchant bank in the mid-1980s, the working environment in which Annemarie began her career was very different compared with the financial world today. “I think that was quite a big accomplishment,” she says. “Not only was I just one of only a handful of women globally in that role, I was also in my late 20s as well – so still relatively young.”</p>
<p>Her experience in banking, and particularly the understanding it gave her of how the ‘other side’ operates, is something Annemarie still finds useful in her current role. “I can relate to what the bank dealers are experiencing and accommodate and appreciate their difficulties, maybe in pricing certain sizes for instance. This understanding of how the other side works and their constraints has enabled me to put in place realistic procedures and policy.”</p>
<h3 id="a-step-change">A step change</h3>
<p>In December 2006, Annemarie joined Plan International, a global child rights organisation, heading up the group treasury function. At the time, the organisation was planning a restructuring of the function and looking for someone to drive that change. Of course, Annemarie did not hesitate when the opportunity to try something exciting and different presented itself. “I had wanted to work in a company in which there was an end product at the time. A physical end product, such as a can of baked beans, seemed to me a more tangible way of adding value to society. But what is more tangible than directly improving the lives of thousands of children?”</p>
<p>The work of a treasurer at a non-profit organisation is actually not at all dissimilar to the treasury in the corporate world, she explains. The risks to manage and methods are driven by company exposures, whether domestic or international, and size – regardless of whether the treasury is in a profit making or non-profit making organisation.</p>
<p>There is one small but notable difference, however, that appealed to her. “The breadth of currencies we manage here is huge,” she says. “We do have the same risks to manage and the scope of those risks is often larger owing to the number of countries we operate in. We are also mindful of our quasi fiduciary responsibility as the funds being managed and exchanged are donations. Preservation of value is paramount.”</p>
<p>She adds an example: “For instance, if installing a latrine under a sanitation programme costs about £10 and if we can achieve a saving of £3,000 by purchasing Tanzanian shilling from bank A versus bank B, then we in the treasury department think of it as 300 latrines and each cost saving being achieved improves lives for children.”</p>
<h3 id="diversity-and-equality">Diversity and equality</h3>
<p>When Annemarie first undertook a senior role in treasury, the lack of women in the field was noticeable. “An early conference that I went to abroad in the late 1980s with international dealers staged a dinner for delegates and an alternate venue for spouses one evening. My husband found himself at a fashion show. He told me there were a handful of men amongst 500 or so female spouses.”</p>
<p>Whilst no longer that extreme, Annemarie still finds that women remain under-represented at conferences. “Maybe as I remarked earlier, the market deadlines and timezones do not lend themselves to flexible working and that discourages women.”</p>
<p>In her experience, opportunities to travel to conferences are often limited for professional women with young children. Annemarie has been lucky enough to have a supportive family, however. “My ex-husband is working in Dubai so my backup currently is my partner who is stepdad to my daughters, and my ex-husband’s wife, who works locally, also steps in when I need support. Having said that, my children are older now – with the eldest being an adult,” she adds.</p></div>

<br/>
<p>Latifah Yusof is Group Treasurer at Astro Group. Based in Kuala Lumpur, she is responsible for the group’s cash management operations and foreign exchange and interest rate exposures. She has played an instrumental role in managing the group’s financing requirements and was part of the key working groups for corporate exercises such as the company’s listing, credit ratings and privatisation.</p>
<p>She started her career at accountancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand, located in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, before moving to Malaysian-based UMW Group, where she championed the set-up of an investment unit. She joined Astro Group in 1997, and has led its treasury group for 12 years.</p>
<p>Latifah holds a BSc (Hons) in Economics from the University of Bath, UK and a CIMA Business Accounting Certificate. She is a member of the Harvard Business School Alumni Club of Malaysia and she recently became the Secretary for the Malaysian Association of Corporate Treasurers.</p>
</img></div>
<h5 id="what-is-the-biggest-challenge-you-are-facing-now">What is the biggest challenge you are facing now, as a corporate treasurer, and as a woman in a male-dominated sector?</h5>
<p>Of course there are challenges in the economy, and the day-to-day work of the treasurer, but one factor that I’m really working hard to achieve right now is enhanced visibility in the boardroom and in meetings between business units. This is not a result of being a female treasurer, but more that treasury is still seen as a mere support unit and not part of the core business.</p>
<p>That said, I do believe that female treasurers need to work harder to stand out and be acknowledged by our superiors – not necessarily through any fault of our own, but because of legacy approaches to business.</p>
<h5 id="do-you-feel-that-women-respond-to-the-needs-of-treasury-in-the-same-way-that-men-do">Do you feel that women respond to the needs of treasury in the same way that men do – or do they bring something different?</h5>
<p>Personally, I believe that women bring passion and empathy into the profession. We are perhaps more likely to guide our team members in mastering treasury skills than our male counterparts – in the same manner that we nurture our children. Also, women often seem to believe more strongly than men in the power of collaboration, not least when it comes to achieving the company’s goals – be it working in partnership with our internal or even external stakeholders, such as bankers and shareholders.</p>
<h5 id="how-much-opportunity-is-there-for-career-progression-within-your-current-role">How much opportunity is there for career progression within your current role?</h5>
<p>With sound experience and understanding in the treasury space, as well as a positive attitude and commitment towards taking on more challenges, I believe opportunities for career progression abound. When I joined Astro, I was just an associate with barely any specific experience in treasury – I’ve now been heading up the company’s treasury department for 12 years.</p>
<h5 id="is-the-business-world-progressing-in-the-right-direction">Balancing professional and family life is tricky – is the business world progressing in the right direction?</h5>
<p>I absolutely agree that getting the right mix of personal and professional time is difficult. The good news is that awareness of this tricky balancing act is definitely more apparent among employers now than it used to be. As such, I believe the business world is progressing in the right direction in providing the relevant support systems for parents in the workplace. For example, the ability to continue to work from home and also to have flexi-hours has become more common in companies of all sizes. In bigger organisations, play schools and day-care centres are also made available.</p>
<h5 id="who-or-what-is-your-greatest-inspiration">Who or what is your greatest inspiration?</h5>
<p>Without doubt, my family is my greatest inspiration. But I aspire to be a role model for successful career women and mothers – excellent at work and at home!</p></div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Driven by a desire to leverage her university studies and the experience she had gained during her formative working years as an audit assistant, in 1997 Latifah embarked upon a career in corporate treasury at Astro, a leading integrated consumer media entertainment group in Malaysia. Describing the attraction of the treasury function, she says: “I see it as a stepping stone towards gaining a deeper appreciation of an organisation’s financial position as well as the financial markets.”</p>
<p>Working her way up through the treasury department at Astro, within just four years, Latifah was put in charge of the function. In her role as Treasurer, Latifah has an extremely varied remit, driven in large part by the dynamism of the business. Domestically, Astro has operations in four key areas of business, namely: pay-TV, radio, publications and digital media. Regionally, Astro Overseas Limited (AOL) is an investment holding company with investment portfolios mainly in India, China, the Middle East, Australia and South East Asia.</p>
<p>Latifah plays “an instrumental role in managing the group’s financing requirements, which includes participation in the key working groups for corporate exercises such as the company’s listing, credit ratings and privatisation.” Of course, cash management operations and the oversight of foreign exchange and interest rate exposures also fall under Latifah’s watchful eye.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote>True equality is too idealistic, but it is not impossible to narrow gaps within a corporate organisation through structured functional and behavioural training programmes and job rotations.</blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source"></p>

<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h3 id="pushing-boundaries">Pushing boundaries</h3>
<p>Never one to shy away from a challenge, in 2010, Latifah championed the implementation of SAP’s Treasury software in order to automate manual processes within the department. “During my time at Astro, I have also developed appropriate treasury policies, as well as surplus cash investments and a treasury risk management framework for the group,” she adds.</p>
<p>In many senses, Latifah’s career embodies what she believes is the best piece of professional advice that she’s ever been given: “To get to the top of the corporate ladder requires hard work. But in working hard, your health must not be neglected.”</p>
<p>Obviously progression in the treasury profession, just as in many other fields, requires a certain work ethic. But getting the right balance between handling the rigours of a career in corporate treasury and maintaining a healthy lifestyle can be a challenge, with the former often favoured at the expense of the latter. This is not the only difficult balance to strike in the corporate world. Inequalities in the workplace can be a significant barrier to certain groups, and Latifah believes there is still progress to be made here. “I believe true equality is too idealistic, but it is not impossible to narrow gaps within a corporate organisation through structured functional and behavioural training programmes and job rotations,” she says.</p>
<p>In many senses, equality is not the biggest challenge facing treasurers today. Many still struggle to even make themselves heard amid the cacophony of voices within the corporate environment. Latifah has a three-step plan to help enhance the treasurer’s visibility in the organisation. The first is setting up a treasury committee, comprising relevant members of the senior management, to oversee treasury activities. Ideally this committee would sit at least quarterly. “This way the treasurer has the platform to recommend ways to narrow gaps in the organisation that can affect treasury areas such as cash and foreign exchange management,” explains Latifah. She also recommends making components of the finance costs and income part of treasury’s KPIs, and finally, with endorsement from the management, that the treasurer supports or participates in treasury events and forums.</p>
<p>Latifah is by nature a forward-thinking person and she always has an eye on how she can improve the way she operates as a treasurer. The one tool she covets more than any other would be a mobile application that can store treasury-related positions and exposures and simulate upside or downside scenarios, “so that I don’t have to lug my laptop around everywhere,” she says.</p></div>

<br/>
<p>Jennifer Boussuge is head of Global Transaction Services at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Based in London, she is responsible for developing and executing the integrated strategy for the full end-to-end regional treasury and custody business for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA).</p>
<p>Boussuge has worked for Bank of America Merrill Lynch for 19 years. Most recently, she was head of Global Sales for GTS where she was responsible for setting the company’s global treasury and custody sales strategy, driving revenue and mobilising teams across all regions to win mandates. Previous roles include head of International Subsidiary Banking Sales, GTS, EMEA; GTS Industry Head leading the delivery of global treasury and liquidity management services to large corporate healthcare and consumer and retail clients throughout the U.S.; senior treasury sales officer for International Government clients and client manager for International Corporates.</p>
<p>Boussuge has worked in the banking industry for 26 years. Before joining Bank of America Merrill Lynch, she worked at Riggs National Bank and Citibank in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>Boussuge graduated from Mary Washington College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science and French. She conducted her graduate studies in French at the Sorbonne University in Paris, France and business administration studies at the George Washington University in Washington, DC.</p>

<h5 id="what-did-you-want-to-be-as-a-child-and-how-did-that-relate-to-your-career-in-banking">What did you want to be as a child and how did that relate to your career in banking?</h5>
<p>My main ambition, even during my teenage years, was to be a politician. It was really by coincidence that I pursued a career in banking – and through various reorganisations that I chanced upon the world of Global Transaction Services (GTS). It’s a world that I am extremely passionate about since you can make a tangible difference to a company’s growth and efficiency.</p>
<h5 id="is-there-anything-that-you-would-have-done-differently">Looking at your career path to date, is there anything that you would have done differently?</h5>
<p>As I look back at the stages of my life and career, it all seems to have happened for a reason. My personal and professional aspirations have dovetailed well. So, when I wasn’t progressing as quickly as I might have liked in my career, my son was born. That gave me the opportunity to spend more time at home and make the most of being with my young family.</p>
<h5 id="how-easy-is-it-for-women-to-balance-their-personal-and-professional-life-today-while-allowing-for-career-progression">How easy is it for women to balance their personal and professional life today, while allowing for career progression?</h5>
<p>Technology is a huge enabler and has given us all the flexibility to be able to achieve a better work/life balance. Working mothers and fathers are able to leave the office on time or take their children to doctor’s appointments and then log back on at a time that is more convenient for them. The bank also runs a range of programmes around parenting and careers, as well as giving support to women returning from maternity leave. By nurturing returning talent, companies such as ours can encourage greater female representation within the higher ranks of their organisation.</p>
<h5 id="do-you-think-that-the-financial-sector-might-be-in-better-shape-if-there-were-more-women-in-senior-positions">Do you think that the financial sector might be in better shape if there were more women in senior positions?</h5>
<p>There are some interesting statistics around that topic. Thomson Reuters examined the performance of companies with more than 30% women on their board against those with less than 10% and found that those with the greater female representation fared much better in periods of economic volatility. A McKinsey study, across all industry sectors, found that the companies with the highest proportion of women on their boards significantly, and consistently, outperformed those with no female representation by 41% in terms of return on equity, and by 56% in terms of operating results. The numbers speak for themselves.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-the-best-piece-of-advice-that-youve-been-given-in-your-professional-life">What is the best piece of advice that you’ve been given in your professional life?</h5>
<p>One of my first managers gave me a book called ‘True North’ by Bill George. It talks about being true to yourself and standing by your own principles. That taught me the importance of being authentic in both business and personal circles – don’t try to be somebody that you’re not.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Be competent, be confident, but be caring. These are the ‘three Cs’ that Jennifer Boussuge has aimed to embody throughout her 19-year career at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Having risen up through the ranks, with previous roles including Global Head of Sales for GTS, Head of International Subsidiary Banking Sales, GTS EMEA, and GTS Industry Head leading the delivery of global treasury and liquidity management services to large corporate healthcare and consumer and retail clients throughout the US, Jennifer’s appointment as Head of Global Transaction Services, EMEA in July 2013 is a reflection of her vision, hard work and commitment, and also of her ability to inspire and motivate.</p>
<p>Indeed, as a member of the bank’s Diversity and Inclusion Council and Co-Executive sponsor of its ‘Lead for Women’ Employee Network, Jennifer has a very keen personal interest in developing talent in the workplace. “I take great pride in being a mentor, and in many ways, a role model for women within the bank. But it’s also important to me that we have balanced opportunities for both genders,” she says. “Here at the bank our experience is that gender diversity leads to stronger business performance which ultimately produces better results for our clients.”</p>
<p>That said, Jennifer does believe that women bring a different skillset to treasury than their male counterparts. “Typically women are by nature quite collaborative. They’re good at asking questions (they’ll always stop and ask for directions!) and they tend to be proficient at juggling a multitude of tasks. If you look at how the treasurer’s role has changed and evolved over the last few years, and how corporates are striving to do more with less, that really plays to a woman’s strengths,” she adds.</p>
<p>Although the current treasury environment may play to the female skillset, there remain a number of women in treasury who struggle to make their voice heard within the organisation and find it difficult to demonstrate the value that treasury brings to an organisation. Jennifer suggests that data may hold the key: “Today, treasurers are being asked more frequently to provide information to the C-suite. Where treasury professionals – both men and women – can start to raise their profile and make themselves even more valuable within the organisation is by better understanding the data flows within their organisation. Through the analysis of this data and the identification of useful patterns, the treasurer can become more of a strategic partner to the business.”</p>
<p>“As a bank we have been doing a lot of work with clients to help them turn information into data. This is all part of a movement towards greater collaboration across the market,” Jennifer observes. “In addition to this data enhancement, we’ve definitely seen treasurers calling more on external partners, such as outsourcing providers, and implementing increasingly sophisticated technology in order to get the best use of the limited resources that they have available.”</p>
<p>Regulation has also made the market more collaborative, says Jennifer. “Today, there are major regulatory pressures and costs which affect not only the banks but also impact corporates. It’s easy to dwell on the negative consequences of regulation, but it has markedly improved the security and transparency of the global financial system. It has also led to deeper partnerships between the global banks and the local financial institutions.”</p>
<p>Interestingly, she also believes that regulation has brought banks and corporates closer together: “Relationships are now much more in focus. As a result of Basel III, when we look at how we provide capital to our clients we aim to have a much deeper and multi-faceted relationship with them in order to support the overall lending relationship. A loan is now looked at as an investment in a client and in a relationship,” she explains.</p>
<p>This candid, straight-talking approach is one of Jennifer’s hallmarks – as is her ability to recognise the opportunities that nestle among changes and challenges. How appropriate, then, that Jennifer’s motto in life (borrowed from Canadian former professional ice hockey player Wayne Gretzky) is: “you miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.”</p></div>

In this interview, she shares her views on the benefits of gender equality in corporate treasury functions and outlines the importance of a collaborative workplace environment.</em></p>

<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Michelle Dovey</h4>
<h5 class="title">Group Treasurer</h5>

<br/>
<p>Michelle Dovey started her career at TI Group plc (now Smiths Group plc) in administration roles following a lengthy gap year in Spain. She moved into Group Treasury as a Treasury Assistant in 1997 then was promoted to Treasury Dealer in 1998, Dealer/Analyst in 1999 and then Chief Dealer in 2000.</p>
<p>Following the merger with Smiths Group in 2001, Michelle moved to AEA Technology plc as Treasury Manager.</p>
<p>After two and a half years at AEA Technology, Michelle moved to Imperial Tobacco Group PLC as Head of Group Treasury Operations. After working on a number of transformational acquisitions on the Group, Michelle was promoted to Deputy Group Treasurer.</p>
<p>With six and a half years at Imperial Tobacco under her belt, Michelle moved to National Express Group Plc as Deputy Group Treasurer in 2010, subsequently being promoted to Group Treasurer, the role that she continues to hold.</p>
</img></div>
<h5 id="do-you-feel-that-women-bring-something-different-to-a-treasury-team">Do you feel that women bring something different to a treasury team?</h5>
<p>Every team member, whether male or female, brings something different. But it’s true that men and women typically approach tasks in different ways, which is useful for problem-solving in the treasury function. So, gender diversity is definitely beneficial.</p>
<h5 id="balancing-professional-and-family-life-is-tricky-is-the-business-world-heading-in-the-right-direction">Balancing professional and family life is tricky – is the business world heading in the right direction?</h5>
<p>Since technology now enables remote access, progress is being made towards flexible working arrangements which allow for a better balance of priorities. I feel strongly though that flexible working should be a society issue rather than a gender issue.</p>
<p>Men and women, regardless of whether or not they have children, should be able to have a balance between their work and personal lives. This flexibility is something that responsible business leaders should be pushing, not just female groups. I believe that we need to get to a position where employers do not know whether a woman or man that they are interviewing will be the primary child carer or not. To achieve true equality requires a fully flexible working model.</p>
<h5 id="are-quotas-the-answer-to-equality-in-the-workplace-at-all-levels">Are quotas the answer to equality in the workplace at all levels?</h5>
<p>Quotas might work in the short term, but we need a better long-term solution that stops women leaving the workplace and enables the promotion of talented women to senior positions on merit. Only then will we see a balance of men and women in senior roles.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-the-biggest-treasury-challenge-you-are-facing-right-now">What is the biggest treasury challenge you are facing right now?</h5>
<p>EMIR is a real hurdle. It’s extremely difficult to get internal buy-in for it because there is no financial payback to allocating staff to work on regulation. And at a time when Western economies are teetering on the brink of recovery, this kind of regulation puts an unnecessary burden on corporate resources.</p>
<h5 id="if-there-was-one-tool-that-could-help-you-to-be-an-even-better-corporate-treasurer-what-would-it-be">If there was one tool that could help you to be an even better corporate treasurer, what would it be?</h5>
<p>The best tool you can have is a great team. That means having a supportive and inspiring boss together with a supportive and talented team that share your vision for treasury. At National Express, I’m very lucky to have both. They help me to be the best corporate treasurer that I can be.</p>
<h5 id="who-has-been-your-greatest-inspiration">Who has been your greatest inspiration?</h5>
<p>As with many successful women, I have a very strong role model in my mother. She has shown me throughout my life that it is possible to marry strength and determination with a nurturing and caring nature. I, together with my brother and sister, had a lot of encouragement to be the best that I could be, whatever my gender.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Heading up a corporate treasury department was not an obvious choice of career for Michelle Dovey. In fact, it was quite by chance that she had the opportunity to fall in love with the world of treasury. While working in an administrative role at TI Group (now Smiths Group) in 1997, a vacancy became available for a treasury assistant. Ambition, and a healthy dose of curiosity, propelled Michelle to apply for the position. Soon, she found herself working in a 12-strong treasury function under the guidance of the enigmatic Carol Power.</p>
<p>“It was fantastic having Carol as my first boss because she had also taken an administration into treasury route, so she was incredibly inspiring and gave me a lot of good advice. As for the role itself, I couldn’t believe how lucky I was to find something that I really enjoyed doing. And when you enjoy what you do, it makes the world of difference to your performance,” says Michelle.</p>
<p>With plenty of on-the-job training from those around her, and the AMCT Diploma in Treasury under her belt, Michelle was soon promoted – on several occasions in fact. By the time TI Group was acquired by Smiths Group in 2000, she was Chief Dealer. “After the acquisition, I was offered the role of Treasury Manager, but I decided it would be good for me to make a move to a different company and experience something new. It was time to push myself outside of my comfort zone,” she explains.</p>
<p>In July 2001, Michelle joined AEA Technology as Group Treasury Manager. She subsequently moved to Imperial Tobacco in May 2004 as Head of Group Treasury Operations. After three years, Michelle was promoted to Deputy Group Treasurer and after three and a half years in that role, Michelle landed the position of Deputy Group Treasurer at National Express. True to form, after only 15 months at the company, she was promoted to Group Treasurer.</p>
<h3 id="equality-and-openness">Equality and openness</h3>
<p>It seems then, that being a woman in a male-dominated profession has not hindered Michelle’s career progression. Although she has not been held back as such, she does believe that the glass ceiling still exists. “It might be a little more brittle than it used to be, but it’s still tough. As a woman in business, you have to accept that certain people will always judge you first on your gender. Their opinion of you will be led by that, even before they have seen the quality of your work or capabilities. Women often have to work harder to win the trust or respect of these people, which can be quite exhausting.”</p>
<p>It can also be quite lonely. “As you become more senior within an organisation, gender gaps become more obvious. You often end up being the only woman in the room at both internal and external meetings,” she observes. “Nevertheless, I am very heartened by my team at National Express where I’ve been lucky enough to work with a few bright and strong women. My team is a very supportive and collaborative one.” In terms of gender balance, National Express’ treasury team of four is equally split between male and female professionals. “Previously we were actually an all-female department – which is pretty unusual in the world of treasury,” she jokes.</p>
<p>The collaborative team environment at National Express has also helped Michelle to recognise the importance of aligning her values, and those of the treasury team, with the values of the Finance Director and the Group. “Often, criticisms or tensions arise in companies because the treasury department, like many other functions, works in a silo and sets its objectives independently. What I have learned is to take the time to consider how my actions will impact other departments and group strategy. It’s also important to think how I, as treasurer, can make the company (not just the department) more successful.”</p>
<p>Adopting this approach should also help treasurers to make their voice heard within the organisation, she advises. “Treasurers, especially women, need to learn how to better employ their relationship skills within the company. Raising your profile internally will give you greater exposure and access to board executives, building trust and credibility. This can only be good for your career prospects, and for the standing of your treasury team.”</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p><i>In a highly competitive jobs market, young people can benefit from hearing about your experiences. Volunteers are needed to inspire the next generation.</i></p>
<i></i><br/><p>Can you spare just one hour a year to go into a school or college to talk to young women about your career and life experiences? The <a href="http://www.inspiringthefuture.org/about/inspiring-women-campaign.aspx" target="_blank">Inspiring Women</a> campaign is aiming to register 15,000 women from all backgrounds and professions to talk to students in state secondary schools about their work and life experiences. Treasury and finance professionals at all stages of their career are more than welcome!</p>
<p>The new campaign has been set up by the charity the Education and Employers Taskforce as part of their ‘Inspiring the Future’ <a href="http://www.inspiringthefuture.org/" target="_blank">programme</a> because research shows that girls respond best when hearing from other women. The charity, which arranges for male and female volunteers from all sectors and professions to visit state secondary schools and colleges to talk about their jobs, held its first Inspiring Women careers fair at the end of January.</p>
<p>The event, held at a southern counties school in England, attracted support from 175 women doing diverse jobs including electricians, a shadow minister, lawyers, occupational therapists, bankers, a plastic surgeon and presenter, writer and broadcaster, Clare Balding. Organisations being represented included Aston Martin, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, BSkyB, CBI, Crossrail, Little Miss Geek, National Trust, NHS, Premier League, Royal Air Force, Sainsburys, the Medical Women’s Foundation and the University of Cambridge.</p>
<p>As well as the careers fair the school hosted a ‘career speed dating’ event with 100 girls and ten highly successful women including Miriam González Durántez, partner at law firm, Dechert LLP (and wife of Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg), and Jennifer Taylor, Chief Operating Officer EMEA, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>González Durántez said of the scheme: “Girls need to feel free to make their own choices. The main purpose of the Inspiring Women campaign is to reassure them that there are many female role models out there willing to help and that any option they take in life is valid if it is what they really want”.</p>
<p>One of the founding corporate supporters of Inspiring the Future is Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Alex Wilmot-Sitwell, President, EMEA, BofAML, said the world of work is changing rapidly and young people need to be prepared for future opportunities. “We can all help to ensure they develop the right skills. We know that the programme makes an impact.”</p>
<p>A spokesperson at the bank told Treasury Today that “700 colleagues have already signed up to spend time in schools local to their home or office, talking to youngsters about what they do at the bank. They are returning to work full of encouragement and enthusiasm, saying just how much they enjoyed speaking to the young people, who ask some great, thought-provoking questions”.</p>
<p>Inspiring the Future is supported by all the main UK employer and workforce representative bodies. Volunteers can get involved independently or through their employer.

<br/>
<p>Lisa Tierney joined Luxottica Group in May 2009 and was appointed European Treasury Manager in January 2011. She has held several positions within treasury, including at Diageo, the worlds’ leading premium drinks corporation. In addition, she has a background in banking, having worked in Merrill Lynch on the treasury funding side. She holds a degree in Economics from Trinity College Dublin, a MSc degree in Investment and Treasury and is an Associate of the Irish Taxation Institute (AITI) having completed the professional tax exams.</p>
<p>Luxottica Group is a leader in premium, luxury and sports eyewear with approximately 7,000 optical and sun retail stores in North America, Asia Pacific, China, South Africa, Latin America and Europe, and a strong, well-balanced brand portfolio. In 2012, Luxottica Group posted net sales of more than €7 billion.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-is-your-career-defining-moment">What is your career-defining moment?</h5>
<p>It’s hard to define your career in one moment but two that stand out are first of all getting the opportunity to kick-start my career with Diageo Plc, a large multinational company (MNC), and more recently taking responsibility at regional level in Luxottica, where I am European Treasury Manager.</p>
<h5 id="which-women-in-business-most-inspire-you-and-why">Which women in business most inspire you and why?</h5>
<p>In the early stages of my career in treasury, I worked with some inspiring women who instilled their passion in me. Luxottica actively promotes women in the workplace and our workforce actually comprises a 60/40 female to male split.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-the-biggest-challenge-you-are-facing-just-now">What is the biggest challenge you are facing just now?</h5>
<p>Luxottica is a fast growing company and the biggest challenge is integrating new acquisitions and new retail and wholesale subsidiaries into our business model. From a treasury perspective, this entails significant travel as we meet the local finance teams and our relationship banks in order to understand the business operations and relevant banking requirements.</p>
<h5 id="what-couldnt-you-manage-without">What couldn’t you manage without?</h5>
<p>The network of contacts that I have built up throughout my career is invaluable. On occasion, I can tap into their vast experience and knowledge base which enables me to tackle certain challenges that my current role presents. Building and maintaining relationships with people across all functions and departments in Luxottica has allowed me to gain a better understanding of the business and ensures that the treasury department plays a key role in servicing it.</p>
<h5 id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-other-women-in-treasury">What advice would you give to other women in treasury?</h5>
<p>Gaining as much experience as possible in all facets of the treasury function and building a strong network of contacts are key to progression. Also, in my experience, some women shy away from certain opportunities presented to them such as attending relevant conferences and forums. I find that by attending such events you become more aware of what is happening in the wider treasury world and the financial markets and how other people approach the different challenges.</p>
<h5 id="if-there-is-one-thing-you-could-have-done-differently-in-your-career-path-so-far-what-would-that-be">If there is one thing you could have done differently in your career path so far, what would that be?</h5>
<p>I believe languages are extremely important in business now more than ever before. Working for an Italian company with significant global reach you come into contact with people from different cultures and languages all the time. The company provides language classes for staff and I am learning Italian at present.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Lisa Tierney’s first taste of the treasury world was with the global beverage company, Diageo, where she worked with a number of inspiring women who held senior positions in the firm. These senior executives acted as mentors in the early stages of her career. They set the standard that Tierney endeavoured to emulate as she progressed in her career. This illustrates the importance of women putting themselves forward for managerial and director-level positions, and acting as a role model for younger women in the business. This will have a greater impact on changing the gender composition of boards and treasury teams than a formal quota, according to Tierney.</p>
<p>She began her career in treasury after completing a degree in economics at Trinity College, joining the treasury team in Diageo at its headquarters in Dublin. “I decided that this was where I wanted to work – in a fast-moving environment with a broad range of activities, such as cash management, inter-company financing and foreign exchange (FX) management.”</p>
<p>From Diageo, Tierney moved to the banking side to Merrill Lynch, and was involved in cash and liquidity management – funding various business units on a day to day basis across the various currencies. She embarked on an MSc in Investment and Treasury, studying part-time whilst continuing to work. She then moved to FTI, a specialist international treasury company providing treasury management solutions and consulting services to a diverse range of companies, which gave her excellent experience in dealing with all aspects of corporate treasury both operational and strategic.</p>
<p>“I continued to study at night and the MSc proved very practical, tying in with aspects of what I was dealing with on a daily basis,” explains Tierney. “I moved out of the treasury environment for a short time and then found myself returning to a position with Luxottica Trading and Finance in 2009.” She has been with Luxottica for four years, starting out as a Senior Treasury Analyst before being promoted to European Treasury Manager in 2011.</p>
<p>What she enjoys about treasury is the integral role it plays within the business. “Treasury deals with many different departments, groups and banks on a daily basis in order to get its job done. I am always talking to different people, for example the local finance teams in our subsidiaries in order to understand their needs and then working with our banks to get the right services in place for those subsidiaries.”</p>
<p>Treasury is also a challenging environment, especially in the case of Luxottica, a fast-growing company which is expanding into the emerging markets both on the wholesale and retail sides. Since December, the company has acquired two companies in Europe that it is now integrating into the Luxottica model: Alain Mikli, a bespoke boutique eyewear business in France that has operations across Europe, US and Asia; and Sunglass Time, a retail chain with stores across UK and Europe. Furthermore, Luxottica has incorporated a new wholesale subsidiary in Russia and retail operations in Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>“When we are acquiring a company, or a new company is incorporated, treasury is involved right from the outset with the M&amp;A and legal teams. For a new company all the risk factors are assessed and this can entail evaluating new banking partners, currency of bank account, invoice currency, etc. Where feasible, new group companies are quickly linked to the cash pool structure so they can access funds for their day-to-day operations. For acquisitions in particular, bank account consolidation is key in order to simplify the flows and allow for automation of accounts payable (AP) and accounts receivable (AR) processes. For this, we liaise with our shared service centre (SSC) in Italy, IT and accounting departments as they on-board companies into SAP,” says Tierney.</p>
<p>The treasury team in Dublin has responsibility for cash, liquidity and FX risk management activities across Europe. Due to the fact that Luxottica’s primary manufacturing site and HQ is located in Italy, the region sees quite significant flows, while at the same time the region accounts for about 80% of the group’s total FX exposure. There are approximately 50 legal entities across Europe with the majority linked to the regional cash pool structures. In addition, there are approximately 50 banking relationships to be managed. The challenges include forecasting and ensuring all cash generated is centralised into our cash pools as quickly as possible for use at group level.</p>
<p>The treasury team is involved right down to local level with each of the subsidiaries and Tierney negotiates credit lines, fees, etc, both with Luxottica’s local banks and also the main cash pool bank. “It is very important to have a constant communication with our banks in order that they continue to provide good service to us as the business expands. With such a fast-moving environment, we want the process to be as smooth as possible. Having the communication channels open with the various relationship teams makes it a lot easier when a new company comes on board and you want something done very quickly.”</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p><i>Treasury Today’s Women in Treasury initiative was launched in January 2013. Aiming to provide a platform to support, inspire and increase the visibility of women working in our industry, the project began with a series of profiles in Treasury Today and Treasury Today Asia. These profiles of female high flyers working across the treasury profession presented a personalised view of womens’ backgrounds, struggles and career highlights. Following this, in June 2013 we launched the Women in Treasury Annual Study. The first of its kind, our Study was developed to better understand the female treasurer’s experience at work, including issues such as salary parity and career development.</i></p>
<i></i><br/>
<h3 id="women-in-treasury-annual-study">Women in Treasury Annual Study</h3>
<p>To present the results of our Study, bring women in the industry together and provide a networking platform, we hosted a Women in Treasury Forum. On Thursday 31<sup>st</sup> October the first Women in Treasury Forum was held at London’s Four Seasons Hotel, Canary Wharf. 150 women from a wide range of industries attended to be part of this pioneering initiative. The Forum provided a rare chance for women in our industry to network, share their experiences and hear our four panellists discuss the key issues highlighted by the Study.</p>
<p>The event started at noon with a pre-lunch networking reception during which Angela Berry, Publisher of Treasury Today, presented an ice-breaking welcome message and an exclusive summary of the Study findings. This was followed by the lunch during which an ‘all-star’ panel discussion took place.</p>
<p>The panel line-up of four extremely well respected women within the treasury industry was composed of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Maeve Robinson, Assistant Treasurer, Omnicom Group and the winner of Treasury Today’s Adam Smith Awards Woman of the Year 2013.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Marie-Astrid Dubois, Assistant Treasurer of Honeywell and Highly Commended Adam Smith Awards Woman of the Year 2013.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jenny Knott, CEO, Standard Bank.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pam Walkden, Group Treasurer, Standard Chartered Bank.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our panel focused on four discussion areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Job satisfaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mentoring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘Vive la differénce’.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The discussion was facilitated by Maia Rushby, CEO of Diversity in Leadership, in leading a lively and inspiring debate around the role of women within our industry, obstacles to their ongoing success and what women can do to improve their career prospects. Going beyond mere theory and conjecture, these four women articulately shared many personal experiences and accounts of the highlights and trials of their impressive careers to show all women in the industry that they can and should be aiming as high as their ambitions permit.</p></div>

<blockquote>I thought it was very inspirational because usually you are just working in a team and you don’t really think about what the differences are between you and your colleagues. It was good to hear from very experienced women of ways in which you can think about how you operate in the future and how you can change things for people who may be younger than you.</blockquote>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>A question and answer session followed the discussion, with many interesting and challenging views and questions raised. We recognise the importance of networking, mentoring and support. Our panellists have had many role models that have inspired and encouraged them throughout their careers. Whether an appointed or unknowingly chosen mentor, such figures (either male or female) are vital in raising the ambitions and confidence of any aspiring woman.</p>
<p>The panel discussion and question and answer session echoed many of the views expressed throughout this year by the women featured in our Women in Treasury profile series, where many female treasurers have expressed their fierce commitment and passion for their profession. What resonates from the responses we have gathered is that the majority of women in treasury feel they are experiencing inequality, both in pay and in career prospects, and this appears to be exacerbated for those who have children. Nearly 60% of Study respondents said that they did not believe they were paid the same as their male counterparts – nor did they feel their career prospects were the same.</p>
<p>Two areas of inequality specific to treasury are identified as the highly male environment that the industry remains and the fact that the nature of the work of a treasurer does not lend itself well to flexible working arrangements, making life particularly difficult for treasurers who are also parents. In addition, one topic that came up during the panel discussion was that women must become more forthright at demanding the (sometimes flexible) working conditions that they need in order to manage the very top jobs and balance that with external responsibilities.</p>
<p>When it comes to professional networking, key to career development, there are very few existing platforms available for women treasurers. Our Study and subsequent Forum have served to highlight the necessity for women to better promote themselves, to find great mentors and to support one another. Although nearly all of the women surveyed stated that they think mentorship is key to career development, over 50% are working for a company that does not offer such a programme. The Women in Treasury Forum was a perfect opportunity for female treasurers to raise their visibility, learn from each other’s experience, and to network amongst their peers.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>And we aren’t stopping there. The Women in Treasury initiative has only served to highlight just how essential it is that we create a platform for the women in our industry. In 2014 we will be holding a Women in Treasury Asia Forum in Singapore in May to create a networking and discussion platform for women in the industry working across the Asia Pacific region. We will then host a networking Forum in London in November. We will, in addition, be developing further print, online and event based networking for 2014 to run alongside our ongoing series of female corporate profiles.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>True to her philosophy on life, Jennifer Gillespie has worked hard to get where she is, but always found ways to have fun along the way. As a working mum, she firmly believes in “not sweating the small stuff”.</p>
<br/><div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Jennifer Gillespie</h4>
<h5 class="title">Head of Money Markets</h5>
<img alt="Legal &amp; General Investment Mangement" class="logo org" height="53" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/legal-and-general-investment-management-logo-2013-80x53.png" width="80"/>
<p>In 2008 Jennifer Gillespie joined LGIM as Head of Money Markets, moving from Scottish Widows Investment Partnership (SWIP) where she was Investment Director, Money Market Funds. Prior to this Gillespie also held the role of Treasury Manager with Scottish Widows Bank (SWB). She has more than 18 years’ industry experience covering segregated cash mandates, liquidity and cash funds. Gillespie graduated from the University of Waterloo in Canada with a Bachelor of Arts (with Honours) in Soviet Studies. She is also an Associate of the Chartered Institute of Bankers in Scotland.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-is-your-career-defining-moment">What is your career-defining moment?</h5>
<p>When I talked myself into a treasury job at Scottish Widows without finance or treasury experience. The company had created a bank and was in the process of setting up a treasury dealing room. As the treasurer wrote the job description for a treasury assistant, I would say “I can do this – what about me?”</p>
<h5 id="which-women-in-business-most-inspire-you-and-why">Which women in business most inspire you and why?</h5>
<p>Other working mothers. The women that tell me how they rushed home and baked a cake, then helped with the homework, etc. Seeing other mums doing it makes me think that I can do it too.</p>
<h5 id="what-couldnt-you-manage-without">What couldn’t you manage without?</h5>
<p>My friends. I need friends to call, have a glass of wine with, laugh and moan. My de-stressing activity is being with other mums and kids from school, mums from the City, friends and family – I couldn’t do without them.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-your-next-major-objective">What is your next major objective?</h5>
<p>I believe I have one more career move forward left in me and am just working out what that will be. I would like to look at a non-executive role, not necessarily in business. It’s nice to give back to others by sharing your experiences, explaining what you have done and how you can help them.</p>
<h5 id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-other-women-in-treasury">What advice would you give to other women in treasury?</h5>
<p>Work really hard and have fun. You won’t get anywhere unless you work hard –whether you are male or female. And have fun because the moment that it isn’t fun, then you need to figure something else out.</p>
<h5 id="if-there-is-one-thing-you-could-have-done-differently-in-your-career-path-so-far-what-would-that-be">If there is one thing you could have done differently in your career path so far, what would that be?</h5>
<p>Taking an objective look at my strengths and weaknesses, I might have chosen a different career. But this is an answer I could only give with hindsight – I didn’t know this when I was 20.</p>
<h5 id="do-you-agree-with-current-proposals-for-a-quota-of-women-on-the-board">Do you agree with current proposals for a quota of women on the Board?</h5>
<p>This is a forced solution to the problem of not having more women executives. On the flip side, however, fixing a quota puts it on the agenda and makes people do something. But it needs to be more than a tick-the-box exercise – we need a plan to change the status quo.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Mentoring can be really effective, but a good mentoring relationship is based on personalities not gender.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a working mum, Jennifer Gillespie has to be incredibly organised. “My kids laugh at me because I will email them about putting something in the diary that is three months away. But I know that if we don’t then it will get close to the day and I will have forgotten,” she says. She finds inspiration in other mums that are juggling similar workloads. “However, it’s important to always remind yourself not to sweat the small stuff. I can’t do everything, so I am only going to accomplish what is absolutely necessary.”</p>
<p>Legal &amp; General Investment Management (LGIM) is “great” when it comes to work-life balance, according to Gillespie, for working mums and employees with other commitments. She comes in early in the morning but leaves at 5pm in order to have the chance to see her children. “It is nice to work for a company that respects that you are a working mum and agrees to work through it with you. They recognise that getting the job done and parental responsibilities are not mutually exclusive. They acknowledge that you have other priorities in your life and are willing to work with you to get the best out of you,” she explains.</p>
<p>Canadian by birth, Gillespie came to the UK in 1994 after completing a History degree in Soviet Studies. She wrangled herself a job in treasury at Scottish Widows in Edinburgh, first as treasury assistant and then treasury manager. She stayed with the company for 14 years, every few years moving into new spheres as the company changed and grew, re-inventing herself along the way. Five years ago, Gillespie decided to move from Edinburgh to London and join LGIM.</p>
<p>She fits well in treasury and money markets because she is good at numbers and loves the fast pace and talking to people. “In the early days, you could spend your whole day on the phone talking to people; certainly in those days you did a lot more telephony work. Although Bloomberg was available, it wasn’t quite the same automated system it is today. So I started working my way through different jobs and then realised four or five years later that this was something that I really wanted to do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Fixing a quota puts it on the agenda and makes people do something. But it needs to be more than a tick-the-box exercise.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“I didn’t see this as a stepping stone into fixed income or CFO roles, but stayed within money markets and watched the whole industry change with the invention of the euro and new products,” she explains. “I keep saying to myself that I have been through it all – up yield curve, flat yield curve, down yield curve – and there is nothing I haven’t seen. But then something comes up and I will realise that I haven’t seen that yet.”</p>
<p>Gillespie’s day-to-day tasks include looking at the markets, the fund and some things that the team may or may not be doing – effectively getting up to speed each morning. Then she does client meetings, presentations and participates on a number of committees. Together, the operational and investment trading sides take up most of her time. “And chatting to people on the phone. I love talking to the market and finding out what’s going on,” she says.</p>
<p>Although proud of her career and achievements, in hindsight there are certain instances when Gillespie believes she was perhaps too risk averse. “If I could go back, there are little points in my career that I could have said no or yes to, and maybe I should have. Sometimes women are just not as big risk takers as men are. Many men will immediately take a job when offered, move to a different location and take the chance; whereas it doesn’t come as easy for women. At least it doesn’t come as easy for me because I think of my kids, husband, dog, cat, etc. In that way, your choices are made for you because you are looking at the bigger picture. But for most men it is easier for them to make that quick-fire decision.”</p>
<p>Interestingly, she doesn’t think that woman-to-woman mentoring in a company quite works. “It is important for companies to have career progression paths in place, although I think that broader-based leadership programmes are the best way to do this” she explains. “Mentoring can be really effective, but a good mentoring relationship is based on personalities not gender. If a company identifies a woman or man who can come up through the ranks and be exceptional, then the most appropriate mentor is the one who believes that that person will be successful and can help them achieve that.”</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Ping Chen traded in her aerospace engineer training for a career in corporate treasury. Seeing how international treasury adds a tangible value to business operations validates the change she made in her career.</p>
<br/><div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Ping Chen</h4>
<h5 class="title">Director, International Treasury</h5>
<img alt="Pfizer" class="logo org" height="41" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/pfizer-logo-2013-70x41.png" width="70"/>
<p>Ping Chen is Director of International Treasury at Pfizer. She manages capital structure planning, financing, liquidity, financial risk and cash management for Pfizer’s subsidiaries in Asia. Chen has worked in the banking industry providing financial services to multinational corporate clients. She holds a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics and a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from New York University.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-is-your-career-defining-moment">What is your career-defining moment?</h5>
<p>The moment I made the switch from aerospace engineering to finance. Seeing how international treasury adds a tangible value to our business operations validates the change I made in my career.</p>
<h5 id="which-women-in-business-most-inspire-you-and-why">Which women in business most inspire you and why?</h5>
<p>Two women that I have worked with immediately spring to mind as inspirations: Camilla Uden, Treasurer at Zoetis, and Cecile Guegan, Vice President Finance Oncology at Pfizer Pharmaceuticals. Uden is inspiring because of her integrity, deep knowledge and strategic insights into the business operations; as my mentor, Guegan showed me how a non-American can make a successful career in a US MNC.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-the-biggest-challenge-you-are-facing-just-now">What is the biggest challenge you are facing just now?</h5>
<p>Overseeing Pfizer’s operations in 15 Asian countries from the US. There are many different regulatory constraints in this region and continual changes. I have to make sure I am on top of everything so that our businesses have the support needed to thrive.</p>
<h5 id="what-couldnt-you-manage-without">What couldn’t you manage without?</h5>
<p>I couldn’t be without the support and mentoring from our treasury leadership, for example Neal Masia, Bob Landry and before them, Richard Passov. They provide me with strategic guidance and inspire me to expand my business acumen.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-your-next-major-objective">What is your next major objective?</h5>
<p>We are looking into setting up an Asia regional treasury centre (RTC) to provide timely support in the region. In addition, we are focused on retaining talent, which has traditionally been quite difficult in Asia as there is strong demand for talent and usually a high turnover rate. We want to create a culture where employees are motivated, inspired and have a career path within Pfizer.</p>
<h5 id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-other-women-in-treasury">What advice would you give to other women in treasury?</h5>
<p>Find your passion, strengths and unique skill set at an early stage in your career. Once you have established your career, then build up your networks, share knowledge with your peers and benchmark your performance against the best in the industry.</p>
<h5 id="if-there-is-one-thing-you-could-have-done-differently-in-your-career-path-so-far-what-would-that-be">If there is one thing you could have done differently in your career path so far, what would that be?</h5>
<p>I wish I had found my passion earlier and followed a more linear path to where I am now. But, then again, my training in science and engineering increases my logical thinking and analytical skills, so it definitely has not been wasted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When you find your passion and what you really like to do, you will continue moving forward.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although many corporate treasurers take unusual paths into the profession, switching from aerospace engineering to treasury puts Pfizer’s Director of International Treasury, Ping Chen, in a class of her own. The scientific method and logical thinking she employed when transforming the company’s treasury structure across the region is part of what won Pfizer the Asia Pacific Regional Award for Best Practice at the Adam Smith Awards this year.</p>
<p>Chen was following somewhat in her father’s footsteps (he was a battleship designer) when she began her undergraduate degree majoring in aerospace engineering in China and then received a scholarship to continue her studies in the US. Following two years analysing production data for a petroleum company in Houston, Texas, she got her first job on Wall Street working for a major global investment bank designing their currency and commodity trading systems.</p>
<p>“I was intrigued by capital market activities, the way the market moved and how it was possible to develop mathematical models to gain a deeper understanding,” says Chen. The bank sponsored her MBA (at night) at NYU, which she completed in three years. “I realised then that my passion lay in finance and I was determined to move to the investment banking side,” she explains.</p>
<p>She moved to the banking side and worked for two large banks in the capital markets arena. At that time, Pfizer treasury was one of the bank’s clients and she saw how her skillset worked better and contributed more on the client side.</p>
<p>“Finance is something I like and am good at, which really prompted me to make the switch,” says Chen. “What attracts me is the dynamism of the capital markets, where every day you could be dealing with something completely different. It is always evolving and is very powerful, especially in the US which is the centre of the global financial markets.”</p>
<p>The corporate side is where she could observe how financial positions are implemented and the change that the business experiences as it grows. “It fits my personality as well – I enjoy working on products, not just selling them. I want to see the process implemented and the result – and have ownership of the project.” She gives the example of the major project she is currently working on at Pfizer. “In Asia we embarked on a seven-year project to centralise the transactional treasury activities – and to date we have implemented the project, which is cross-division, cross-function and cross-region, in four countries. I have been able to see the solution implemented country-by-country and see how international treasury adds a tangible value to our business operations. That satisfaction I don’t think I can get anywhere else.”</p>
<p>As Director of International Treasury, on a day-to-day basis Chen oversees 15 countries in the Asia Pacific region. She develops and implements treasury strategy, including the subsidiaries’ capital structures, oversees cash management, hedging foreign exchange (FX) and financial risk exposure, through to managing all intracompany financing activities.</p>
<p>Much of what she knows, Chen learned on the job, especially in a field where the market changes so much. “I learned the basic foundations during the MBA, but to really add value to your business you have to learn from the market. The daily activities you perform with your peers and the interactions you have with your mentors is where you get new ideas and develop,” says Chen. “That is why I feel that when you find your passion and what you really like to do, you will continue moving forward.”</p>
<p>Pfizer has a formal mentoring programme available to all employees as well as a special subset of the programme for women mentor/mentee programme, which Chen believes works very well. She met Cecile Guegan, Vice President Finance Oncology at Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, through the formal programme. They decided to continue the mentor/mentee relationship after the formal programme ended and meet at least once every other month.</p>
<p>“I think that it is excellent that the company has this kind of supporting infrastructure to give people career aspirations,” says Chen. “Cecile and I found a mutual benefit, which is why we continued on with the relationship outside of the formal programme.”</p>
<p>Mentoring and other support programmes are better ways to encourage women in treasury, she believes, than legislating a quota for women, something that has been discussed in Europe to increase the number of female Board members. “Pfizer is doing a great job – it is building the infrastructure through female mentor/mentee programmes. If we can leverage the infrastructure established in our company, for example, we could be on our way to improving diversity within the industry. It might take a while, but eventually we will get to where we want to be.</p>
<p>“A pipeline of women coming into the profession is important, and if you have the infrastructure you will develop the pipeline. But it has to be a merit-based system. If you are good, you will reach the top,” Chen says.</p></div>

<h5 class="title">Assistant Treasurer</h5>

<p>Maeve C. Robinson is currently Assistant Treasurer of Omnicom Group Inc. and the Treasurer of its wholly owned subsidiary Omnicom Capital Inc. She is responsible for all treasury operations in North America, as well as providing direction for treasury processes and systems across Omnicom’s global footprint. Additionally, Robinson plays a lead role in Omnicom’s credit risk management, credit insurance programmes, working capital programme, and treasury accounting and systems. Giving back to local communities has always been important to Robinson and she put her passion to work by becoming a founding principal of Omnicom Cares, the group’s community service initiative which organises community projects in support of children worldwide. Prior to joining Omnicom in 1994, Robinson was a Senior Manager at Coopers &amp; Lybrand (now PwC), working primarily in the advertising and marketing sectors. She has more than two decades of accounting, finance, working capital and cash management experience. She received her BBA from Siena College and is a CPA.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-is-your-career-defining-moment">What is your career-defining moment?</h5>
<p>I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow. In 1994, when I was eight months pregnant, I changed jobs, moving from public accounting into treasury. It wasn’t easy but it certainly was a defining moment in my career. I realised that I could do anything, even starting a new job and giving birth in the same month. It certainly impressed my colleagues and hopefully inspired a few women along the way.</p>
<h5 id="which-women-in-business-most-inspire-you-and-why">Which women in business most inspire you and why?</h5>
<p>One of my bosses in public accounting would sign everything she did in very neat penmanship. She always said that you should sign your work with your full name because you should be proud of what you have accomplished. I try to apply her philosophy to everything that I do.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-the-biggest-challenge-you-are-facing-just-now">What is the biggest challenge you are facing just now?</h5>
<p>The global financial environment becomes more complicated every day, so my challenge is to make sure we have a solid foundation in place to keep Omnicom going day-to-day and years into the future, without any hiccups.</p>
<h5 id="what-couldnt-you-manage-without">What couldn’t you manage without?</h5>
<p>My talented and highly motivated staff. If it wasn’t for their contributions, I wouldn’t be here today. They are a loyal, hardworking group. I would also add my babysitter, who has been the backbone of my family.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-your-next-major-objective">What is your next major objective?</h5>
<p>We are working on a project that is likely to be a game-changer in payments. It will save Omnicom several million dollars a year in banking fees, make the company much more efficient, and provide increased visibility on our spending. This should be up and running in Canada and the US within a year.</p>
<h5 id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-other-women-in-treasury">What advice would you give to other women in treasury?</h5>
<p>Use your creativity. Sometimes women have a different perspective which can be helpful during a brain-storming, problem-solving session. Don’t be afraid to be creative and thoughtful, nor to speak out, even when you are outnumbered. If you do it the right way, it will get the reception that it deserves.</p>
<h5 id="if-there-is-one-thing-you-could-have-done-differently-in-your-career-path-so-far-what-would-that-be">If there is one thing you could have done differently in your career path so far, what would that be?</h5>
<p>When I first went into public accounting, I was disappointed not to gain experience at a financial institution. Rather, the only opportunity I was offered was in the advertising industry. But if I had worked in a bank, who knows where I would be today. I couldn’t be happier than working at Omnicom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Don’t be afraid to be creative and thoughtful, nor to speak out, even when you are outnumbered.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Winning the first-ever Treasury Today Woman of the Year Award at the 2013 Adam Smith Awards came as a shock to Maeve Robinson, for she hadn’t been aware that her team had nominated her. “I only discovered that they had nominated me when notified that I had won the award. I was so thrilled. And the best part of winning was that my staff thought enough of me to put my name in the hat,” she says. “Omnicom wouldn’t be where it is today without my great staff, so I think of it as a ‘team of the year’ award.”</p>
<p>Reading her case study clearly demonstrates the reasons why our judges honoured her, with 19.5 years of dedication inside the company, as well as outside the company in the wider community. A Certified Public Accountant (CPA), Robinson holds a number of other titles within Omnicom, including Treasurer of Omnicom Capital Inc. (OCI) and CFO of Omnicom Finance Canada, as well as having other global responsibilities. She is a founding principal of ‘Omnicom Cares’, her company’s community service initiative which organises projects in support of children worldwide.</p>
<p>Interestingly, as a result of her experience winning the Woman of the Year award, Robinson has recognised that developing women’s networks are very important and now plans to look into doing something at Omnicom. “I am thinking small at first, maybe just something in our building here in Connecticut, and then perhaps broaden out to New York City.</p>
<p>“Currently, we do not have a formal mentoring policy at Omnicom, although I think of it as part of my job to develop everyone who works for me. I don’t treat the men or women that work for me any differently, but sometimes I feel that women need a different type of mentoring than men, so I try to fulfil that requirement.”</p>
<h3 id="on-the-job">On the job</h3>
<p>Robinson began her career in accounting, spending ten years in public accounting at Coopers &amp; Lybrand. She was fast-tracked to management, first to manager in three and half years and then on the partner path, but decided that she didn’t want to go on to be a partner. Through her public accounting experience she became a specialist in advertising agencies, effectively becoming the “go-to person” for any advertising-related questions.</p>
<p>When a good friend landed the job as controller at Omnicom, “which was my dream job” she says, he called Robinson a year or so later to see if she was interested in a career change out of public accounting and into treasury. “And thankfully, one thing led to another and that brought me over to Omnicom and my career in treasury – and I haven’t looked back,” she says.</p>
<p>Today, Robinson manages the US, Canadian and the Latin American treasury operations. The company’s global treasury structure is centralised within regional treasury centres (RTCs) acting as in-house banks (IHBs). Globally, the local offices conduct their own banking procedures but their account balance is reduced to zero at the end of the day and transferred to their designated RTC. The liquidity from each RTC can then be opportunistically invested locally or concentrated at the Connecticut treasury centre, headquarters for the corporation’s treasury. Robinson manages the company’s daily liquidity positioning.</p>
<p>The current market environment is creating a number of challenges for Robinson, as with the vast majority of other treasurers. “Liquidity is always an issue. Currently, we fund ourselves daily with commercial paper – it is inexpensive and a very liquid market at present. But that could dry up tomorrow and then what would we do? My job is to ensure that we have a structure in place to keep us going day-to-day in spite of challenging market conditions.”</p>
<p>In addition to banking and liquidity, treasury at Omnicom is responsible for working capital management, with Robinson managing the working capital programmes in the regions she oversees. “We work with all the operations in those regions to improve their cash management activities, including billing and collection practices, processing of vendor invoices, etc, in order to improve our working capital. This was a big part of my job when I first arrived, as accounting makes up a large part of working capital – for example understanding how the billing process works. This was an easy conversion to make because of my public accounting background.”</p>
<p>Her favourite part of the job is discovering ways to make treasury more efficient, looking for “the next big idea” to streamline processes by, for example, implementing a new system. Since Robinson joined the company in 1994, the organisation has grown seven-fold and treasury staff has only increased by between five and ten people. “As a result of putting in new systems and automating processes, there is less manual intervention and manual error, which ultimately means less risk for treasury,” she says.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Rising to the challenges thrown at her during the financial crisis in Greece, Marianna Polykrati, Group Treasurer, recently moved from Greek food conglomerate Vivartia to Chipita Group, which is a food company of Greek origin but with a strong international footprint.</p>
<br/><div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Marianna Polykrati</h4>
<h5 class="title">Group Treasurer</h5>
<img alt="Chipita" class="logo org" height="45" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/chipita-logo-2013-60x45.png" width="60"/>
<p>Marianna Polykrati joined Chipita S.A., a confectionary company of Greek origin with a strong international footprint, as Group Treasurer in June 2013. Most recently she was Head of Group Treasury at Vivartia, which is one of Greece’s largest food and beverage groups, consisting of 125 companies. At Vivartia, she focused on strengthening cash and liquidity management, improving corporate financial management, investigating new capital markets funding, managing risk and controlling treasury operations. Prior to joining the Vivartia Group and working for the corporate side, Polykrati has worked for eight years in financial services. Her career started as an account officer for Emporiki Leasing (member of Credit Agricole Group), where her clients comprised of medium-sized Greek companies, ranging from small retail stores to large manufacturing plants; she then moved to Emporiki Venture Capital (member of Credit Agricole Group) as an investment manager, with responsibility for projects in Cyprus, Russia and distressed Greek companies. Her transition from the financial services to the corporate sector was initiated through the assignment of the role of deputy general manager in one of her distressed projects, Polychromo, a small printing unit in Greece and Romania, which was accomplished at Vivartia.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-is-your-career-defining-moment">What is your career-defining moment?</h5>
<p>The moment I decided to switch from the banking to the corporate side. I found it challenging at the time, but it proved invaluable in broadening my experience and knowledge.</p>
<h5 id="which-women-in-business-most-inspire-you-and-why">Which women in business most inspire you and why?</h5>
<p>I think that women who are in executive level positions and also have families are admirable. In Greece, those women are a minority – making up less than 10% of corporate executives. However, the fact that they are able to effectively handle a family and work at the same time inspires and motivates me.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-the-biggest-challenge-you-are-facing-just-now">What is the biggest challenge you are facing just now?</h5>
<p>Managing and safeguarding the group’s purse is a challenge because of the difficult economic conditions in Greece. Bank funding in Greece is scarce, so most Greek companies are now tackling working capital management on a daily basis. Since Chipita has the majority of its business outside Greece, financing is not an issue; therefore treasury is focused in optimising the current debt capital structure and investigating different cash pooling methods.</p>
<h5 id="what-couldnt-you-manage-without">What couldn’t you manage without?</h5>
<p>Working with people that are both professional and show their human aspect is very important to me. I have been extremely lucky to date in that the people I report into and those that report into me are professional and their work is excellent, while at the same time they haven’t lost their human side in a business context.</p>
<h5 id="what-would-you-like-to-do-more-of-in-your-job">What would you like to do more of in your job?</h5>
<p>I like to work more globally, hence the move to Chipita, because there are so many things that can be engineered in treasury, in terms of banking and financing, trade finance and supplier finance, which are currently limited in the Greek market.</p>
<h5 id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-other-women-in-treasury">What advice would you give to other women in treasury?</h5>
<p>Keep calm and be patient. Taking into consideration that there are few women in treasury positions, we have to keep calm because – due to their female nature – women are best equipped and quite resilient to handle the current difficult and stressful conditions.</p>
<h5 id="if-there-is-one-thing-you-could-have-done-differently-in-your-career-path-so-far-what-would-that-be">If there is one thing you could have done differently in your career path so far, what would that be?</h5>
<p>I consider myself lucky because I have worked with excellent people throughout my career. I have learned many lessons in previous jobs and I hope I will learn many more from future ones.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Bank funding in Greece is scarce, so most Greek companies are now tackling working capital management on a daily basis.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Marianna Polykrati has the difficult – some may say unenviable – job of protecting a Greek company’s balance sheet in extreme market conditions, which have not eased since the onset of the financial crisis in 2008. It is a good thing that she thrives on challenges. She has recently made the move from Vivartia, a food production conglomerate brand in Greece, to Chipita Group, which is a food company of Greek origin but with a strong international footprint.</p>
<p>She began her career in 1996 in the banking sector, working for a Greek leasing company. After four years, she moved to a venture capitalist (VC) company within the same bank group and through the VC switched to corporate finance. Polykrati says that she has “never regretted nor looked back”. In hindsight, it was a good move at the right time because today the banking sector in Greece is quite weak, whereas the corporate sector has proved to be more resilient to the crisis.</p>
<p>The corporate side is also more interesting, with a unique set of challenges. “In treasury, we work as a partner with many business departments including production, distribution, marketing and sales, which allows us insight into the different sections of the company. In addition, we interact with the banking sector. As a treasurer you never really leave the banking sector, but you are a part of something that is much more intriguing and challenging.”</p>
<p>Polykrati’s day-to-day job as Group Treasurer at Vivartia had undergone a major transformation since the onset of the crisis. Pre-crisis, when there was a lot of available credit, treasury was not overly focused on cash management because food production conglomerate Vivartia had excess cash. In addition, the company’s large size meant it could help support its suppliers’ and clients’ credit terms. The company had no problems accessing credit and financing its working capital. “We were offered facilities by both Greek and international banks – up until 2010 we had a lot of loan syndication with foreign banks,” she says.</p>
<p>Although the crisis started in September 2008, Greece was more affected in late 2009. Vivartia was one of the last corporates to feel the impact – this happened in mid-2010. Treasury had to reorient its activities because credit became more difficult to obtain; as a result it began renegotiating terms with both clients and suppliers in order to improve its working capital cycle.</p>
<p>At the same time it focused much more on cash management. “We started really working on our cash flows,” says Polykrati. “Previously, we looked more at indirect cash flow methods. Since 2010, and especially 2011 and 2012, we focused on direct cash flow reporting and implemented an in-depth analysis of our actual trend year-to-year. Every month we do a rolling forecast for the remainder of the year.”</p>
<p>Vivartia has 95% of its operations in Greece, with very few exports but some of its suppliers sit outside the country. “Within the country, consumption is falling and unemployment is rising, and with bank funding almost non-existent we have to tackle working capital on a daily basis. We are tackling payments almost like cash-on-delivery (COD). All of these areas are very challenging right now in order to cope with daily cash flows in Greece,” says Polykrati. Insurance companies still don’t insure receivables that are 100% based in Greece, which is another big issue for treasury.</p>
<p>Chipita, on the other hand, is a completely different story. Due to its international presence, with the majority of its operations outside Greece, the Greek crisis has only remotely impacted the group’s operations compared to other Greek companies. Hence for treasury, funding is not the major issue; instead it is split between optimising the current debt structure and tapping into alternative capital and debt markets, while at the same time proactively strengthening cash management in each country and assessing cash pooling methods, as well as monitoring foreign exchange (FX) risks.</p>
<p>Although a number of networking groups have cropped up in Greece specifically to promote a more optimistic view of the market environment and develop new business initiatives, there are currently no organisations that are looking specifically at women and the challenges they face. Polykrati believes that it would be a good idea to create networks of women because they have a greater propensity to be able to handle the current difficult and stressful market conditions by developing creative solutions.</p>
<p>On an individual company basis, a corporate mentoring programme could also help promote new ideas and ways of thinking. More importantly, it could put in place a pipeline of female treasury professionals that could help change the gender balance from the bottom up to the executive level – in Greece less than one in ten Executive Board members are women. Polykrati believes this will prove to be a better solution than a quota system. “I don’t understand why you should have a quota for something that should be self-explanatory. If you have a quota for the Board but you don’t have one in the lower echelons of the organisation, then I don’t believe it will make a difference. If you don’t have women at executive levels, then the women on the Board will not have the necessary experience.”</p>
<p>In terms of career development, Polykrati believes that there is a role for both on-the-job training and professional qualifications. “There are always things you can gain with professional training that you can’t find on the job. However, for me it is more preferable that junior staff have on-the-job training because when they come out of school they usually lack experience as to how things work in the real world. Better to have on-the-job experience at the start, and then as you go on have more training outside the job.”</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>According to Lelaina Lim, to work in treasury you need to be both “brave and firm”. Brave because today’s world throws up changes incredibly quickly; and firm because you need to do what you have to do for the company’s best interests, “which is not always easy”. Lim exemplifies both attributes.</p>
<br/><div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Lelaina Lim</h4>
<h5 class="title">Chief Financing Officer</h5>
<img alt="Royal Sporting House" class="logo org" height="38" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/royal-sporting-house-logo-2013-130x38.png" width="130"/>
<p>Lelaina Lim has more than 30 years of financial and accounting experience in various commercial sectors with a strong track record reinforced by regional exposure in China and the ASEAN countries. After receiving her Bachelor of Accountancy from the National University of Singapore in 1983, Lim joined Ernst &amp; Young (E&amp;Y) as an auditor, specialising in oil and gas. When she received her Certified Public Accountant (CPA) from the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Singapore (ICPAS), she moved to Trans-Island Bus Services (TIBS), a public bus transport operator in Singapore. In 1989 Lim joined Oakwell Engineering, an oil and gas company, as Senior Accountant. She worked there for 11 years and moved to Finance Manager and then Regional Controller. In 2000 she joined another oil and gas company, GRP Limited, to sort out their non-performing loan (NPL) status. In 2003 Lim was headhunted to join International SOS (ISOS), a medical evacuation company, based in Shanghai. After three years, she left ISOS to become Financial Director for a US company called Electronic Arts (EA), a gaming company which wanted to go into online gaming in China. In 2008, Lim returned to Singapore to join RSH as CFO.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-is-your-career-defining-moment">What is your career-defining moment?</h5>
<p>The day I decided to move to Shanghai to head up the Greater China operations for International SOS (ISOS), a provider of medical emergency services. I think that was the hardest decision to make, but it made a massive impact on my career.</p>
<h5 id="which-women-in-business-most-inspire-you-and-why">Which women in business most inspire you and why?</h5>
<p>Olivia Lum, Group CEO at the water management company, Hyflux, is a remarkable woman. She grew up orphaned in Malaysia and then came to Singapore. She has achieved so much and is very successful – she won the Ernst &amp; Young World Entrepreneur of the Year in 2011.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-the-biggest-challenge-you-are-facing-just-now">What is the biggest challenge you are facing just now?</h5>
<p>Not in work, per se, but the general public’s acceptance of gender diversity in the boardroom. Singapore has one of the lowest percentages of women as Board members – only making up 7.1% of listed companies’ Boards in 2011.</p>
<h5 id="what-couldnt-you-manage-without">What couldn’t you manage without?</h5>
<p>Definitely my laptop and BlackBerry – I must have connectivity. Also, daily FX rates; if I don’t know what the current exchange rates are, I get very nervous. For me it is akin to missing breakfast.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-your-next-major-objective">What is your next major objective?</h5>
<p>Succession planning is something that is uppermost in my mind. I am 52, and although retirement is still a way off, it is a good time to start planning for the next person to power up into my position. I would view myself as being successful if I can get someone ready for when I have to move on.</p>
<h5 id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-other-women-in-treasury-and-finance">What advice would you give to other women in treasury and finance?</h5>
<p>In treasury you need to be brave and firm: brave because today’s world throws up changes incredibly quickly; firm because you need to do what you have to do for the company’s best interests, which is not always easy. Finance, on the other hand, needs steady hands and back up, whether that is from your boss, banks or several key players on the team.</p>
<h5 id="if-there-is-one-thing-you-could-have-done-differently-in-your-career-path-so-far-what-would-that-be">If there is one thing you could have done differently in your career path so far, what would that be?</h5>
<p>Wind back the clock ten years and I might have moved into operations, which I have always found interesting. Effectively using my financial background, knowledge and ability but on the operations side.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In a crisis, you need to remember that cash is king.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Celebrating 30 years in finance and accounting, Lelaina Lim has had a fascinating career, culminating in her current role as Group CFO of RSH Limited, the single largest retail company in Singapore with more than 100 shops and operating regionally in ten countries. However, immediately after she joined RSH, Lehman Brothers collapsed and the global financial crisis ensued.</p>
<p>In 2008-2009, RSH was in the midst of expansion into Dubai, with a commitment to open 25 shops in the newly-completed Dubai Mall. Lim proposed a multi-prong strategy to tackle operations in a new economic paradigm. “In a crisis, you need to remember that cash is king. In order to have more cash, we shortened our credit period, reduced inventory and marked down some items, to encourage people to buy even though the economic situation was quite dire,” explains Lim.</p>
<p>RSH’s shareholders went through a difficult period due to Dubai World’s debt problems in 2009, which saw the banks pull back credit lines. As a result, the company tightened its expansion plans and returned to its core business strategy. “In 2009 we worked with our banks to make sure our FX exposure was limited, because currencies were fluctuating wildly and our FX exposure is quite high on a monthly basis,” Lim says. The shareholders decided to change RSH from a listed company to a private one, so at the end of 2009 and in early 2010, Lim worked on delisting RSH from the Singapore Stock Exchange (SGX). This occurred in 2010, and in 2011 new shareholders came in to buy out part of the existing shareholders’ equity. This deal was completed in March 2012 and RSH is now part of the Al Futtaim Group, which also owns the Robinsons Group.</p>
<p>Lim outlines four “hot topics” she is working on today:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Tax planning, which has grown in importance because of complex and ever changing cross-border tax regulations, especially in South-East Asia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intellectual property (IP) rights and ensuring that the company has IP protection for its strong brands. IP rights are “intangibles” that the company wants to protect for many years to come.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IT and data protection: ensuring the data is secure but also that there is a single instance of the truth. Since Lim joined, RSH has spent much more money on IT because she believes that “if you have a good set of data and analyse the data properly, then you probably can earn more money than you otherwise would.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Risk management and ensuring that RSH is sufficiently insured in terms of assets and material operations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In relation to the fourth point, Lim gives the example of the 2010 Bangkok riots. RSH had a few shops in the mall where the riots took place. When the Thai government announced the riots were perpetrated by “terrorists”, then the insurance companies could claim existing policies did not cover terrorist activity. “Because of Bangkok, we started to look at insurance in a very different way. I have started implementing a global insurance policy that covers us as much as possible for every foreseeable risk.”</p>
<p>Her move to RSH followed a five-year stint in China. In 2003 Lim was headhunted to join International SOS (ISOS), a medical evacuation company, as Regional Financial Controller to head up ISOS’ China business based in Shanghai. “I took the opportunity to move to China because I thought it was a now or never situation to move out of my comfort zone in Singapore.” ISOS was very different from her previous financial experience in the oil and gas industry, so the learning curve was steep – coupled with the fact that her move coincided with the after-effect of the SARS epidemic. “The business was not performing well because people were afraid to go to the clinic as a result of SARS,” she explains. But she decided that since she was there she had to make the most of it and ensure the company made money.</p>
<p>Therefore, together with the General Manager and several doctors in Shanghai, they revamped the business model and collection process, effectively managed to turn the company from a big loss-making to a profit-making company, with positive cash flow and receivable turnover reduced from 350 days down to 120 days – in just two years. “It was hard and people thought I was very harsh,” says Lim. “But after two years people realised that it was a do-or-die situation. A business that doesn’t collect cash can’t survive.” The company continued to grow up to 40% every year, which was quite common in China in the early days because of the sheer number of people needing services.</p>

<p>After three years, Lim was approached to create a new set-up in China for a US company called Electronic Arts (EA), a gaming company which wanted to go into online gaming in China because of the growing market potential. She joined as Financial Director to oversee government tax incentive applications, drive electronic payments (e-payments) and online wallets, and to partner with a local Chinese game company to integrate their already large membership. In 2008, Lim was contacted by a headhunter to see if she wanted to return to Singapore to join RSH as CFO. “Maybe it was fate, but at the same time my father fell ill, so I took the opportunity to come home to be with him,” she says.</p></div>

<h5 class="title">Global Head of Liquidity Product</h5>
<img alt="Barclays" class="logo org" height="17" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/barclays-logo-2012-100x17.png" width="100"/>
<p>Yera Hagopian is Global Head of Liquidity Product within the Cash Management team at Barclays. She is responsible for driving the delivery of Barclays liquidity product set globally and providing integrated liquidity solutions to the corporate, financial institutions and non-bank financial institutions clients. Hagopian has a wealth of experience in global liquidity management. She recently joined Barclays from J.P. Morgan, where she was EMEA Head of Liquidity. Prior to that, she was responsible for Liquidity Services at HSBC for 11 years, a role which involved the co-ordination and development of HSBC’s global liquidity management. Hagopian is a graduate of Brasenose College, Oxford.</p>

<h5 id="what-is-your-career-defining-moment">What is your career-defining moment?</h5>
<p>When I was seconded to what was at that time the Beecham Group, a British pharmaceutical company, as Assistant Treasurer Operations from 1987-1989. I consider it to be a defining moment because I still use the experience I gained there as a reference point almost on a daily basis.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-the-secret-to-your-success">What is the secret to your success?</h5>
<p>Two things: curiosity and sheer persistence. I am quite stubborn (determined, if you are being kind) but also very curious – I want to know how things work. I have applied my training as a linguist (which is someone that likes to break down the code of a language and find out how it works) to my banking career.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-the-biggest-challenge-you-are-facing-just-now">What is the biggest challenge you are facing just now?</h5>
<p>The biggest challenge is to bring the benefit of my experience to the business, while maintaining all the good things that already exist. That’s the challenge of being a new person on the job and wanting to make changes, while also valuing the good things that are already in place – and there are many of them.</p>
<h5 id="what-couldn’t-you-manage-without">What couldn’t you manage without?</h5>
<p>Human contact would certainly be high on my list – the time to talk to people in order to really understand where they are coming from and their point of view. I also need time to think – to stand back from everything and take a more strategic view.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-your-next-major-objective">What is your next major objective?</h5>
<p>After being away from Barclays for 14 years, I would like to settle in so well that people forget that I had left. I also want to start making a difference. Within the first 100 days I hope to have a broad understanding of the business, have met key people and our customers and formulated my initial view of where I should take the business.</p>
<h5 id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-other-women-in-treasury">What advice would you give to other women in treasury?</h5>
<p>My advice is to take every opportunity open to you to learn and acquire the broadest experience possible. If you are working in product management, then work in sales; if you work in sales, try your hand in operations. You may not be good at everything but the breadth of experience that it will give you is invaluable. I believe it’s good to take an unconventional path when progressing your career.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I think I was made to be a product manager because it is so multifaceted and takes a range of skills.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yera Hagopian recently returned to Barclays as Global Head of Liquidity Product within its cash management team after a 14-year absence. She first joined the bank in 1980 on a management development programme straight out of university and stayed 19 years before leaving for a stint first at HSBC (11 years) and then just under three years at J.P. Morgan. “The different organisations have played an instrumental role in contributing to my understanding of cash management in different geographies, customer segments and product lines,” she says.</p>
<p>For the initial 15 years of her banking, she was what she terms a “generalist”. Her early career development focused on credit and risk, with a fair amount of relationship management and some treasury experience. “I am glad that I got to spend time in these areas early in my career because I think they are fundamental to a bank’s business,” Hagopian explains. During this time she also spent two years working abroad in the US: one year with a relationship team in Chicago and a year in New York in the treasury function.</p>
<p>In what she describes as a career-defining moment, Hagopian was seconded to the Beecham Group as Assistant Treasurer Operations from 1987-1989. Although it was meant to be just a three-month secondment, she was there for just over a year and a half. “That was a fascinating period because it coincided with a major treasury centralisation programme. This gave me insight into the practicalities and challenges of running a corporate treasury,” she says. Almost daily she still uses the experience gained during this time as a reference point. “Whenever I am putting together something for a customer or thinking about a new service, I always find myself calibrating with what I learned during this period.”</p>
<p>Her turn as a generalist ended after leaving the Beecham Group to go on maternity leave. “I took two years out,” she explains, adding that some people still raise their eyebrows when she tells them this. Her husband’s job transfer took them to Dusseldorf. It was exciting to be in Germany during reunification, but it was also quite challenging, especially learning German from scratch with a baby in tow. It was the second time in her life where Hagopian had the experience of going to a country where she didn’t speak the language: her family moved to the UK when she was five years old and didn’t speak a word of English.</p>
<p>When she moved back to the UK in 1989, not only had the world changed but the banking industry had changed as well. Still with Barclays, her first foray into the world of cash management entailed building a small specialist sales team and then she moved into managing a suite of products, including electronic banking. With the first taste of product management, Hagopian was hooked. “I think I was made to be a product manager,” she says, “because it takes a range of skills. It is very multifaceted: you need to understand marketing but also technology; you have to be able to do detailed pricing and also have influencing and people management skills. It takes a specialist but you also have to be a generalist.”</p>
<p>Hagopian describes another career-defining moment, which came early on when she worked on the liquidity product management side, but which is more akin to an epiphany than a moment. It was when she realised that she was “it”: the person that colleagues completely relied on for critical liquidity management advice. “It is quite a wake-up call for a young product manager to realise that a lot of people trust and depend on your knowledge and ability to deal with a situation,” she explains. “You have to assume that mantle of responsibility and bravery, which is the point at which you mature in your professional life.”</p>
<p>Although hard-pressed to uncover anything that she would have done differently in her career, the one thing that Hagopian identifies is that she wished she could have spent more time working in corporate treasury. “Although it wasn’t convenient in terms of my personal life at the time – I went on maternity leave – if there had been opportunities to repeat that experience regularly throughout my career, I think that would have been very valuable.”</p>
<p>She believes that a combination of formal education and on-the-job training is needed, but the latter should come first. “Formal education does a number of things, in particular ensuring that there are no glaring gaps in your knowledge, such as a lack of credit experience when working in cash management,” she says. “But I also believe that training is something you should do throughout your career. It is a time to stand back, reflect and reconsider if what you are doing is the best way to do it and whether there are other angles that you haven’t thought about. Often that comes from meeting peers on training courses and being able to discuss topics in a more abstract way than the job allows on a day-to-day basis.”</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Ellen Cornelissen, Director Treasury Europe, Aleris, moved from linguistics to treasury early in her career and never looked back. Today she oversees European operations, but also supports the new treasury set-up in Zhenjiang, China. The migration to Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) is the biggest challenge facing her this year.</p>
<br/><div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Ellen Cornelissen</h4>
<h5 class="title">Director Treasury Europe</h5>
<img alt="Aleris" class="logo org" height="24" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/aleris-logo-2013-70x24.png" width="70"/>
<p>Ellen Cornelissen has been Director Treasury Europe of Aleris since 2009 and has held several positions within treasury at other multinationals including Adtranz, Bombardier abd Invista. In addition, she has a background in banking, having worked for ABN Amro and HSBC. Cornelissen has worked in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland, and is currently based in Switzerland. She holds a Masters degree from Radboud University (Nijmegen, NL) and is a CertICM.</p>
<p>Aleris is a privately-held, global leader in aluminum rolled and extruded products, and recycling. Our company is based in Cleveland, Ohio, with approximately 7,200 employees in regional offices and more than 40 production facilities around the world.</p>
<p>The company is an industry leader with diversification across geographies, products and end-use industries, including aerospace, building and construction, defense, distribution, heat exchanger, industrial products, molding and tooling, packaging and transportation.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-is-your-career-defining-moment">What is your career-defining moment?</h5>
<p>There were two moments. The first was being able to move into finance without a finance background – I studied languages at university. The second was creating a cash management structure at Adtranz, an ABB and Daimler-Benz joint venture, which opened up my eyes to the world of treasury and is where my love for treasury was born.</p>
<h5 id="which-women-in-business-most-inspire-you-and-why">Which women in business most inspire you and why?</h5>
<p>My boss at Bombardier, Colleen Sidford, who I found inspiring because she is a professional, yet never lost sight of the fact that she is also a woman. She is an extremely knowledgeable treasury expert and I am eternally grateful for having learned so much from her.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-the-biggest-challenge-you-are-facing-just-now">What is the biggest challenge you are facing just now?</h5>
<p>It is a combination of the ongoing Eurozone crisis, general market instability and currency fluctuations. Also, as we have built a new state of the art rolling mill in China, one of my main objectives is to set up a treasury function there. It is challenging but also very encouraging to be able to set up a new structure that supports our growth in a strategically important region for our company.</p>
<h5 id="what-couldnt-you-manage-without">What couldn’t you manage without?</h5>
<p>My husband who is always there to lift my spirits when I am feeling low. After all these years, he still supports my commute between Germany and Switzerland.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-your-next-major-objective">What is your next major objective?</h5>
<p>An imminent goal on my horizon is migrating to the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). I have set up a working group to cover all areas involved (legal, IT, accounting etc) but our treasury team leads this project for Aleris in Europe. In China, I am setting up a solid treasury function that can function autonomously within the global group and support our customers in China. Another main item there is to implement – with my US colleagues – a credit and collection structure. This is especially interesting as payment and collection structures differ much from Europe or the US.</p>
<p>In addition, a big item on my to-do list is increasing understanding of trends in our business in credit and collection. It has become increasingly important to ensure that the team is fully up to speed in adapting to changing market conditions.</p>
<h5 id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-other-women-in-treasury">What advice would you give to other women in treasury?</h5>
<p>Go to conferences, network, make contacts and don’t be shy in asking others for advice or a chance to brainstorm for fresh ideas. That is what I have done in the past and the vast majority of people have enthusiastically responded to me.</p>
<h5 id="if-there-is-one-thing-you-could-have-done-differently-in-your-career-path-so-far-what-would-that-be">If there is one thing you could have done differently in your career path so far, what would that be?</h5>
<p>Looking back, even though I enjoyed studying languages, I would have done something more in the financial space. It would have been easier to have more knowledge before I started.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“An imminent goal on my horizon is migrating to the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When asked what she would be if she wasn’t Director of Treasury, Ellen Cornelissen quickly responds: “Unhappy?” She loves the work because of its diversity, which includes handling cash as well as liaising with banks, legal teams, suppliers, etc. “A long time ago I considered becoming a musician – so that is another love I have. I play the violin and viola. But if I really think about changing jobs today, I would probably return to my old job as an interpreter.”</p>
<p>Interestingly, Cornelissen began her career as a linguist. She has a Masters degree in languages, but made the switch to finance in her early 30s, mainly because a Dutch bank in Germany was looking for someone who could speak three languages fluently. “They hired me with the comment that since I had gone to university, I was smart enough to learn the rest,” she laughs. She decided to give the job a chance because she had always been interested in finance.</p>
<p>Cornelissen completed an internal trainee programme with the bank to get up to speed and also did a lot of external training herself. She had the opportunity to move into treasury when a client of the bank, who needed in-house help to deliver on a cash management project, hired Cornelissen after a six-month secondment. She observes that the trend today is to move from banking to treasury – despite much movement in both directions historically – because the latter is considered to be “much safer” than the former.</p>
<p>Looking back, Cornelissen thinks that, even though she enjoyed studying languages, she probably would have studied in the financial discipline because of the many weekends over the years that it has taken to complete her financial education. “It would have been handy to have had more knowledge before I started,” she admits.</p>
<p>However, it is true that her language skills have proved to be a huge asset. “In my job at Aleris, it helps me tremendously. The company has a production site in Duffel, Belgium so I can speak Dutch with colleagues, but if I go to the production sites in Germany I can speak German. This is a huge advantage because communication is key. I have noticed quite often in my career that things don’t go well if there is a communication problem, and that can also be from misunderstanding or misinterpreting items if the language is not your native tongue.”</p>
<p>Today, Cornelissen is Director of Treasury Europe at Aleris, which is an aluminium producer with a proximate revenue of $2 billion in Europe. She also oversees the treasury function and supports the new set-up in Zhenjiang, China.</p>
<p>“From a daily perspective, it is a typical treasurer’s job,” she says. “I communicate with my banks and keep them happy. I have a small team to do the regular cash management items, such as the cash position and FX. We are responsible for the guarantee side, so ensuring that letters of credit (LCs) guarantees are issued on time and if necessary. Another part of the team is responsible for collections in Europe. Of course one of the main items remains cash forecasting.”</p>
<p>In treasury, Cornelissen has two employees reporting in to her, whereas for collections she has 15 people across Europe that work locally. She has dedicated one of the treasury team to work on the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). “It is a slow process but we are getting there,” she says.</p>
<p>She is also responsible for the liquidity in Europe, including inter-company financing, loan terms and bank agreements. “This is one job that I do myself because of the importance of liaising with the teams to make sure we have enough liquidity and are using it appropriately.”</p>
<p>Operating in China presents specific challenges. “It is difficult to get money into the country due to regulations or get money out if you need to repay inter-company items. And capital injections can take days,” she explains.</p>
<p>Although Aleris does not have an official mentoring programme, the finance team gets together to identify who needs mentoring and the best person to do the mentoring. Cornelissen believes that there is much to be learned from mentors, as well as having the support and help from others who have more experience in avoiding common pitfalls. “I personally think that many women could benefit from mentoring, because in my experience women are much more reluctant to promote themselves. Therefore, some coaching and support in how to present yourself and how to make your achievements known within the company could be a great benefit.”</p></div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>As part of our groundbreaking new Women in Treasury initiative, we are launching a major study of women working within the treasury profession. The objective of this annual study is to build up a picture of the profiles and careers of women at different levels across the treasury profession from junior positions to Group Treasurer/Financial Director/CFO positions. We believe that the findings may surprise us all.</p>
<br/><img alt="Women in Treasury Study 2013" class="logo" height="69" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/women-in-treasury-no-tt-logo-study-2013-624x69.png" width="624"/>
<p>Despite improvements, treasury and finance remain predominantly a man’s world. Nowhere is this more apparent than at industry events, where women certainly do not make up half of the delegates and, more tellingly, where astonishingly few make it onto the speaker platforms. This gender bias is perpetuated as a result of individuals recruiting staff in their own image.</p>
<p>In order to change the status quo, it is important to understand the challenges that women may face when working in treasury. The first step in changing anything is to recognise openly and clearly that a problem exists. Once we have done this we need to assess how deep the problem is and what the potential causes of it may be. For this reason, Treasury Today is inviting female treasurers to participate in an annual study to help chart the profession’s path to diversity.</p>
<p>A targeted study will help corporates examine how they build and maintain a best-in-class treasury function, believes Carole Berndt, Head of GTS for Europe and EMEA at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “It also provides an opportunity to use the results as a tool to engage and to promote change. Insight gleaned from surveys can feed into employee development programmes and be applied to create best practice processes at a company.”</p>
<p>In addition to gauging female treasurers’ reaction to the hotly debated quota question, the survey will address a number of areas that are potential hurdles to successful careers for professional women across most industries, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Work-life balance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pay parity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mentoring/networking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Career progression.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="work-life-balance">Work-life balance</h4>
<p>There is no doubt that the prevalent long hours and ‘always on’ culture in treasury make it harder for women who are juggling childcare with careers. The societal norm dictates that a woman has greater responsibility for the household and children and it is hard to believe that there can be any mothers for whom this has never been an issue, although some may claim so. In fact, part of the whole problem around the work-life balance question for women may relate to their inability to openly declare that there is a problem, preferring to struggle on than to admit that things can be a challenge.</p>
<p>The Managing Director and new Head of Transaction Services EMEA at J.P. Morgan, Sue Dean, links this issue to a well-worn myth of ‘having it all’. “I think we beat ourselves up unnecessarily, thanks in part to the old school ‘having it all’ myth, which suggests that a truly successful woman has a fantastic career, great relationships, perfect children, a sharp wardrobe and a tidy, stylish house. No one has it all, for it is all a balance – and you drive your own balance by the choices you make.”</p>
<p>It is a growing trend that more and more companies are beginning to adopt flexible working hours. Berndt makes the point that cash management has become an increasingly global arena with companies expanding across borders and time zones. “Today, I would argue that you can be as effective in your role working remotely at 9pm as you are working from the office at 9am.”</p>
<p>This, as we are all aware, has changed the way in which we work and granted a freedom and life flexibility that no previous working generation has enjoyed.</p>
<h4 id="pay-parity">Pay parity</h4>
<p>“The playing field is not yet equal for women, and women are evaluated differently than men. The fact is women have to negotiate things for themselves that their male colleagues take for granted,” according to a University of Exeter (UE) report entitled ‘Gender diversity in the financial services sector’ (January 2013). The report cited a 2003 study of business students which found that 85% of men felt that it was up to them to make sure their company paid them what they were worth, whereas 83% of women assumed their worth would be determined by what their company paid them.</p>
<p>A Swiss-based female Treasurer raises an interrelated issue called the ‘Tiara Syndrome’, a term coined by Carol Frohlinger to explain the belief that by keeping your head down and delivering excellent work, people will notice – and eventually place a tiara on your head. She argues that women need to make a conscious effort to raise their profiles internally and externally, such as vocally participating in conferences, team meetings and networking events.</p>
<h4 id="mentoring-networking">Mentoring/networking</h4>
<p>Many women in the financial services sector cite a lack of role models and mentors in the industry as one of the barriers to their own career progression, according to the UE report. It is a fact that is becoming increasingly noted, that whilst men are great at supporting one another professionally, at all levels of their career, women have been quite woefully poor at this key networking and mentoring. This has resulted in a female workforce that, although incredibly capable, are bad at self-promoting and are something of an invisible power in companies. Key mentors throughout a career are vitally important and this mentor need not be of the same gender to oneself. Dean agrees that senior level sponsorship is key to success. “We all need people who understand our potential and will advocate for us. They can be male or female – it doesn’t matter. Building your network and developing advocates in this way is critical.”</p>
<h4 id="career-progression">Career progression</h4>
<p>According to the UE report, a recent phenomenon is the opt-out revolution: women choosing to leave the workplace, often in their thirties or forties, when they are just beginning to achieve success. There are frequent comments that women simply are not driven by the same goals and motivations as men, but that is a simplistic answer to complex issues.</p>
<p>It is true that some companies think twice about hiring or promoting younger women because of the possibility that they will take a ‘career break’ to have a family. Companies are obviously unable to be frank about such choices and it is near impossible to prove, particularly for smaller companies, yet this has got to be something that comes into play because of the financial implications that it poses. How do we get around what appears to be quite a sticking point?</p>
<h4 id="differing-experiences">Differing experiences</h4>
<p>Not all professional women face the same obstacles or have similar experiences. The most noticeable differences can be seen between regions. In addition, it will be interesting to see if there is a marked distinction in responses from women under the age of 40 (versus those over 40), which is indicative of the developing career potential of treasury. Ten years ago there wasn’t a career path into the profession. Instead many entered into it by chance, maybe as an accountant or controller. However, today there is specific treasury training and many are making a conscious choice, it will be interesting to see if the results reflect this hypothesis.</p>
<div class="boxed">
<p>The results of the Treasury Today Women in Treasury Study will be published in an editorial feature in the October edition of Treasury Today. The results will be presented during a webinar and will be available on the Women in Treasury section of the website. To participate in the study, please visit:</p>

<p>Cindy Lee is the Regional Head, Treasury Asia Pacific for BASF, a global chemical company with a production network covering 100 sites in Asia Pacific with more than 16,000 employees in the region.</p>
<p>Lee heads up three different divisions – credit management, finance and treasury platform, as well as a service centre for all the local companies in Asia Pacific.</p>
<p>She joined the regional controlling and reporting team in BASF Southeast Asia in Singapore in 1996 where she moved up the ladder and progressed to her current position in 2010.</p>
<p>Born in Singapore, Lee is married and has one son.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-is-your-career-defining-moment">What is your career-defining moment?</h5>
<p>It was when I built our cash management platform in Singapore, running across 15 countries and took on the cash management duties of nearly 35 companies. I had to hire, teach, build and talk to the authorities and local companies, basically from scratch. The treasury platform now supports 52 companies across 18 countries.</p>
<h5 id="which-women-in-business-most-inspire-you-and-why">Which women in business most inspire you and why?</h5>
<p>All my bosses inspire me. But amongst them, I had two very inspiring female bosses. The first was Odine Hanley-Steemers, who introduced me to treasury, and then Gabriele Spies from Germany took over the same role. These two women taught me everything that I needed to know, especially how to be a leader.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-the-biggest-challenge-you-are-facing-right-now">What is the biggest challenge you are facing right now?</h5>
<p>Every day is a challenge. Each day I am racing against the clock because I have to juggle three different major functions which I oversee. There are many new things in the business world. The good thing is that I love challenges. When I look at changes occurring in the treasury world, particularly in China, India and Indonesia, I am amazed.</p>
<h5 id="what-couldnt-you-manage-without">What couldn’t you manage without?</h5>
<p>I definitely cannot manage without my team members. They are the backbone of the whole department. Their hard work contributes greatly to my success. I also have to say that I can’t manage without my BlackBerry – although it is a love-hate relationship. I love it for the convenience. If I am on the road, which I am a lot because my teams are in three different locations, it allows me to stay in touch with the office. But the hate side is that because of the convenience, I have to be very disciplined when it comes to personal holidays. I try hard not look at it but that usually proves to be quite difficult.</p>
<h5 id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-other-women-in-treasury">What advice would you give to other women in treasury?</h5>
<p>Stay updated with the changes in the financial world, be very focused and always challenge the status quo. Also always build up a network, especially within the treasury community, because you can learn a lot from your peers.</p>
<h5 id="what-would-you-have-done-differently-if-you-could">What would you have done differently if you could?</h5>
<p>To be honest, nothing. The journey has not always been easy, especially when I had to learn everything from scratch without the theoretical background, but I wouldn’t change anything.</p>

<p>“I definitely cannot manage without my team members. They are the backbone of the whole department. Their hard work contributes greatly to my success.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Cindy Lee first started in treasury, she didn’t know much about the profession. Unlike the accountancy or finance sector, she hadn’t heard of treasury before. She has come a long way and is a proponent of the fact that treasury is a crucial department for most companies, not least BASF. Although Lee started in the industry as a total novice, she now heads up BASF’s treasury operations in Asia Pacific.</p>
<p>Lee joined BASF South East Asia Pte Ltd in 1996 as part of the regional controlling and reporting team for BASF Southeast Asia, based in Singapore. She entered the treasury world in 2001 as an analyst in the regional finance and treasury centre. BASF picked Singapore because the government offered a number of incentives for companies to start finance and treasury centres there.</p>
<p>“My initial year at BASF was mainly learning on the job,” explains Lee. She had a degree in corporate communications from the University of London and when she first started the job, it was a bit of a struggle. “To be honest, I had second thoughts.”</p>
<p>However, she had great mentors and bosses, who were very supportive as she learnt the ropes in treasury. Her first treasury boss, Odine Hanley-Steemers from New Zealand and her subsequent replacement, Gabriele Spies from Germany, were both an inspiration to her. “I have to thank Odine for putting me here,” she says. BASF gave her access to training and workshops, and was also quite forgiving when she made mistakes.</p>
<p>In addition to learning on the job and working full-time, she also did her Masters in Corporate Finance with the City University of New York, as a long-distance student. “So while I was learning on the job, I was also learning the theory side,” she explains.</p>
<p>Lee gradually moved up the ladder from an analyst to assistant manager, and in 2005 was made Manager of the Treasury Cash Management Platform in the Regional Finance and Treasury Centre in Singapore. Two years later, she became the Regional Manager for the platform and in 2010 was promoted to her current post as Regional Head, Treasury Asia Pacific in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Her role has also widened well beyond cash management. Lee now leads Treasury Asia Pacific which consists of three different divisions – credit management, corporate finance and the cash management platform, which serves as a professional platform for front office duties of all the local companies in Asia Pacific. The three divisions are based in different cities – Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai for strategic reasons.</p>
<p>When Lee built BASF’s cash management platform, she had to do everything from scratch, as well as build her knowledge on the many regulations in the different countries she manages.</p>
<p>“This is how treasury has evolved within BASF in Asia Pacific and shows how important it has become within the company,” she explains.</p>
<p>She loves her job and is constantly facing challenges, racing against time, deadlines and various projects. “I love every challenge that comes along.” She believes in always challenging the status quo and instead of waiting for regulators to list the rules, she believes in engaging with them. “The central banks always want to hear from treasurers, especially from developing countries,” she says.</p>
<p>Her current role in BASF requires her to travel constantly to her three divisions, although she is technically based in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>How does Lee cope with all the travelling that is required of her job? There are times, in the middle of the night, when she wakes up, and has to ask herself which city she is in. “But somehow I can cope, especially since I have a supportive husband and son.”</p>
<p>Lee will be moving back home to Singapore in June for strategic business reasons. “There will be lots of focus on credit management targeting to deep dive into understanding customers’ behaviour, mitigation of risk on high risk portfolios and also further improving cash flows. Credit management sits in Singapore where our Asia Pacific Trading Centre is set up and has the highest transactional volumes.”</p>
<p>Despite her travelling, Lee has managed to build and maintain a network within the treasury community, both in Hong Kong and Singapore, as she believes strongly in “learning from peers”.</p>
<p>“I meet up with peer groups on a regular basis, in order to exchange ideas, see how things are being done, how central banks are dealing with certain issues and what other companies are doing.”</p>
<p>In addition to her networking with peers, Lee also meets up with BASF’s banks on a weekly basis to “hear their ideas and how their products are being developed to tackle market changes”.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Whilst the treasury profession remains largely male-dominated, there are remarkable women enjoying remarkable careers. The Women in Treasury series will recognise female innovators in the corporate treasury profession. The initiative aims to bring women together to share their experiences, challenges, successes and failures, as an inspiration for all operating in this field.</p>
<br/><p>The press is rife with articles outlining how the treasurer has a new and important role within an organisation. But it is not the traditional treasurer who can fulfil these demands, argues Carole Berndt, Head of Global Transaction Services EMEA, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “The new treasurer has to be able to manage this environment where crisis is business as usual. They will need to have an extreme attention to detail and the things they must manage, such as operational, liquidity and market risk, need to be married with the ability to think strategically and creatively.”</p>
<p>The new treasurer will also need to be a good communicator, effectively co-ordinating the different business lines and functions and promoting collaboration and co-operation across the company. Although not risk-averse, the new treasurer must have a level-head and appropriately weight risk versus opportunity. They must also have the ability to listen and understand the business, and create tailor-made solutions to meet those business needs.</p>
<p>Many of these traits are more commonly associated with women than with men, yet it is shocking to see how few women there are in treasury. A female Director of Corporate Treasury, who asked not to be named, recounted her disappointment with the gender composition at industry conferences. Not only are there only a few female treasurers on the conference floor, but there are next to none participating on the panels or leading the workshops.</p>
<p>Yet the role treasury plays in an organisation makes it a very dynamic space for women to work in, according to Eileen Zicchino, Managing Director and Chief Marketing Officer (CMO), J.P. Morgan Treasury Services. “The treasury function is at the heart of every organisation – wise decisions made there have dramatic and positive impacts on the health of the entire company, and consequently on all the people of that company.”</p>
<p>The Director of Corporate Treasury believes that women need to be much more visible in their roles, both inside and outside of their organisation. While women are notoriously bad at promoting themselves, the Women in Treasury series in Treasury Today and Treasury Today Asia aims to help bridge this gap by profiling female trendsetters on a bi-monthly basis. Each article will look at professional development and career-defining moments, as well as providing advice to those just starting out in the profession.</p>
<p>“Women in all industries and professions can benefit from obtaining insight into other female professionals – on a personal and professional level,” says Christina Easton, Principal at Treasury Dynamics LLC, based in Clyde Hill, WA. “The opportunity to read profiles of women in similar positions, industries or perhaps in more senior positions than your own, provides the practitioner with ‘a-ha’ moments, ideas, courage and inspiration for change.”</p>
<p>Julia Persson, Deputy Head of Corporate Treasury, A.P. Moller–Maersk Group, is enthusiastic about the initiative because “it is good to know that other women have succeeded in the same field and the series identifies role models to look up to”. She is particularly interested in the problem-solving aspect of the profiles. “Most of the issues are probably not gender-specific, but this series could illustrate a different approach to solutions.”</p>
<h3 id="gender-challenges">Gender challenges</h3>
<p>It is evident that women still face specific challenges at work. The pay gap is a stubbornly pervasive problem. A recent Chartered Management Institute (CMI) survey showed that the average gender pay gap for executive level positions is more than £10,000 a year, while women receive less than half what men are given in bonus payments. CMI estimates that the average female executive suffers a lifetime earnings gap of £423,390 when compared to a male worker with an identical career path.</p>
<p>Climbing the corporate ladder is a challenge for many women as they become parents or need to care for their ageing parents or other loved ones. Women are still the primary parent responsible for childcare, although social norms are slowly shifting. A tri-regional survey predicting gender composition in 50 years’ time, conducted by HSBC on the 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary of International Women’s Day (8<sup>th</sup> March 2011), found that 60% of the respondents globally think that childcare will be split 50/50 between men and women by 2060. The regional variation was illuminating: 70% believed this in Asia, while just over half thought this was possible in the US and the UK.</p>
<p>Many women are successful in managing the demands of a family and a successful career, and others want to learn from their experience. “I find it inspiring to hear from others as to how they balance work/life requirements and still enjoy a stimulating career,” says Easton. Marie-Astrid Dubois, Assistant Treasurer EMEA and Asia, Honeywell, holds Christine Lagarde, Managing Director of the IMF, in high esteem for exactly this reason.</p>
<p>But many women, whether they are mothers or not, are frequently overlooked for promotion opportunities. According to a 2012 Catalyst report, women get fewer of the high visibility, mission-critical roles and international experiences – the so-called ‘hot jobs’ – that are key to getting ahead at global companies and may be an underlying cause of the persistent gender gap at senior levels.</p>
<h3 id="diversity-the-new-status-quo">Diversity: the new status quo</h3>
<p>The concept of setting a quota for women in executive positions has been hotly debated for a number of decades. Former banker Mervyn Davies brought it back into the spotlight in March 2011, when he called on FTSE 100 companies to increase the percentage of females at Board level from 12.5% to 25% by 2015. More recently, EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding brought a proposal to the European Commission (EC) in October 2012 to impose a 40% quota for women non-executive directors on the Boards of listed companies by 2020, but this was opposed by several countries.</p>
<p>The attempt to legislate change is a response to the fact that the number of women in senior positions remains persistently low. The Cranfield School of Management’s 2012 Female FTSE Report shows that the overall percentage of FTSE-100 directors who are female is 15% – and this is an increase of 2.5% on the past three years.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the debate has shifted from an issue of equality to a question of better performance. Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Berndt argues that companies perform better when they include the best people from a range of perspectives and backgrounds. “A greater propensity to find new solutions is the key advantage of diversity,” she explains. “Having a range of people, whether gender, cultural or nationality, generates fresh ideas, different perspectives and promotes much more innovation and creativity than a uniform group.”</p>
<p>A number of studies support Berndt’s argument and have found a correlation between high-performing companies and those with strong female representation at the top. According to McKinsey, the findings were startlingly consistent: for companies ranking in the top quartile of executive-board diversity, ROEs were 53% higher, on average, than they were for those in the bottom quartile.</p>
<p>Research by the Credit Suisse Research Institute found that shares of companies with a market capitalisation of more than $10 billion and with women Board members outperformed comparable businesses with all-male Boards by 26% worldwide over a period of six years. The report identified six key reasons why greater gender diversity could be correlated with stronger corporate performance, including a better mix of leadership skills, access to a wider talent pool and improved corporate governance.</p>
<h3 id="talent-pipeline">Talent pipeline</h3>
<p>The debate is not just about getting more women onto the Board but making it possible for women to reach their full potential within an organisation, instead of reaching a glass ceiling or being pushed off a glass cliff. As Ann Francke, CMI CEO, said: “Women make up almost three out of four at the bottom of the ladder but only one out of four at the top. This lack of a strong talent pipeline has to change, and fast.”</p>
<p>McKinsey reports that of the 235 European companies it surveyed, more than 60% said that they have at least 20 gender diversity initiatives in place. It singled out adidas as a success story, a company that ranked in its top quartile in diversity and performance. Senior leaders have designated diversity as a strategic goal and started building it into the ‘guts of the organisation’, setting a goal of 35% of all managers by 2015. The effort is supported by numerous policies, including gender-balanced recruiting, childcare assistance, and flexi- and part-time work opportunities.</p>
<p>The Cranfield School of Management’s report also highlighted a few outstanding corporate initiatives. Diageo, which has the highest percentage of women on its Board (44.4%), including the CFO, encourages “flexibility of career paths, with the ability to step on and off the fast track, and multiple opportunities to connect with diverse role models”. It also has an internal networking and affinity group, Spirited Women, which connects women across the globe.</p>
<p>In 2011 Rolls-Royce implemented a ‘reverse mentoring’ programme, whereby senior executives were mentored by a junior colleague. The aim is to give senior executives a different perspective, sharing diverse experiences and ideas whilst increasing the visibility of diverse talent. Twelve of the 17 reverse mentors are female. Software firm Sage undertook an annual gender diversity review in June 2011; today it proactively encourages coaching and mentoring of female executives to aspire to top leadership roles and insists on a diverse slate of candidates from head hunters for all senior executive appointments.</p>
<p>Many trade and professional associations are also walking the walk. For example, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) has launched Narrowing the Gap, an initiative aimed at retaining women in accountancy, and boasts a 66% female workforce, double that of the industry average.</p>
<h3 id="role-models">Role models</h3>
<p>A growing number of women, both in senior roles and among the rank and file, are finding their voices and inspiring others to achieve progress, reports McKinsey in ‘The Global Gender Agenda’. It is this advice and willingness to share that will make all the difference to a new generation of treasurers.</p>
<p>When asked what advice she would give to other women in treasury, Easton focused on mentoring. “The mentor can be in your industry, within treasury or outside of treasury, a man or woman. Clearly identify what you want to achieve with this relationship, create a profile of the best mentor for you, find the right person, and identify reasonable goals for meetings, including frequency,” she says.</p>
<p>Persson believes that effectively managing your manager, promoting your achievements and building a strong network, both within the organisation and externally, are key elements. “Having good relationships with colleagues is essential and helps when one needs help,” she says. She adds that although these points are not gender-specific, “my impression is that men are generally better at them, when for me it took time and many mistakes to conclude that”.</p>
<p>Berndt also says her advice works just as well for men. “My strongest advice is to trust your intuition, be authentic and true to yourself, and have confidence in your abilities. Quite often we know what needs to be done but we allow ourselves to be talked out of it because it is different to the way things have been done before. Be an advocate for change.”</p>

<div class="copy__body">
<h4 id="tell-us-how-you-arrived-at-your-current-role">Tell us how you arrived at your current role.</h4>
<p>When I got my Master’s degree in Business Administration, I was based in Pennsylvania, and secured an opportunity at Mellon Bank. From there I moved to New York, where I worked at J.P. Morgan, then Citi and now HSBC. All of those assignments started in transaction banking, which I really have a passion for. I refer to myself as a ‘transaction banking lifer’ – in a positive sense, of course!</p>
<p>I moved to HSBC because I was looking to run an end-to-end product business and I wanted to be the executive in charge. I wanted to come in and run a business where I could create ideas from a strategic perspective, including the design of products, selling or distributing the products, risk mitigation and protecting the bank from any harm that could possibly come – as well as having a financial responsibility for the P&amp;L.;</p>
<h4 id="how-do-you-think-the-conversation-around-diversity-and-inclusion-has-changed">How do you think the conversation around diversity and inclusion has changed?</h4>
<p>I’m definitely positive about the progress we’ve made as an industry, but there’s always more to do. I also think it’s important that we don’t stop at gender, and we focus on every aspect of diversity and inclusion. A big area for us is ethnic diversity, and we need initiatives that allow us to take action, using successful lessons from our female inclusion work. </p>
<p>Would you say it’s more important to have a defined career plan or to be open and flexible?
 I would say a little bit of both. If you want to go somewhere, you need to figure out what opportunities will help you get there, or deter you. But you shouldn’t be so firm that you won’t take a position unless it’s exactly the direction that you want. Being flexible allows you to explore things that you otherwise might not have done, and that may be lateral moves instead. Some people spend so long planning every micro-detail, they can then never execute on their plan because it’s too specific and unreasonable.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-your-motto-in-life-or-your-greatest-inspiration">What is your motto in life, or your greatest inspiration?</h4>
<p>My greatest inspiration is my father. I’m one of seven children, and he worked full time as a career businessman whilst raising us. He was always the greatest example of working hard and he taught me to be a force of resilience. </p>
<p>My motto is simple: practise, practise, practise. Too many people want something, but they don’t prepare for it, they don’t practise their elevator pitch, or what to say in an interview. If you don’t practise, you’ll forget what it is you wanted to say, and you’ll sound unnatural and insincere. There’s nothing to be embarrassed about practising, it just delivers greater results.</p>
<h4 id="speaking-up">Speaking up</h4>
<p>As a mother to four children, all of working age, Diane has experienced first-hand how the younger generation is shaking up the workplace. “They do things very differently, and they can educate us about what’s changing in the world,” she says. Additionally, she’s found that this generation has a very strong moral compass, and often don’t have concerns about speaking up. “As leaders we need to be the receivers of this new ‘speak up’ culture, and accept it and act on it.”</p>
<p>This can be especially true for women in finance that are looking to establish and develop a career. For Diane, this is something she feels she has learned the hard way. “If you don’t tell people where you want to go, they’ll make assumptions,” she says. Managers can often have up to 20 direct reports, so they may not know everyone’s individual career ambitions. Therefore, she says it’s important to raise your hand and ask for opportunities and explain the desired direction.</p>
<p>Additionally, Diane notes the importance of companies offering formal mentorship and sponsorship programmes. At HSBC, she sponsors the Accelerating into Leadership programme where, if they meet the performance criteria, women are taught the necessary skills to move further up in the company. The mentoring and sponsoring experience does, for many women, allow a focus on getting their voices heard in one-on-one situations with a senior employee, as well as in a broader context. “I think it’s about giving people the experience to know how to handle a boss, how to handle a difficult conversation, and how to go to people for counselling and advice,” she says. In fact, she adds, when the time comes for performance reviews, the bank’s HR department often gets involved to encourage all staff to be comfortable when reminding their managers what they’ve accomplished.</p>
<h4 id="strive-for-improvement">Strive for improvement</h4>
<p>A global pandemic isn’t the most ideal of circumstances for many companies – and for Diane, it’s no different. She’s learned two main lessons throughout the period: resilience and empathy.</p>
<p>Diane notes that like many, she has been working even longer hours since working from home, as well as taking fewer – if any – breaks, and as such has had to focus on resilience – both physical and mental. “I’d be getting headaches because I hadn’t taken a break or eaten all day,” she says. To combat this, she began scheduling in lunch and exercise breaks to “re-energise and re-invigorate” herself. “I went for walks around my neighbourhood, and saw it from a totally different angle! I saw animals I’d never seen around before, and I learned that I live near some water that you can’t even see from the road.”</p>
<p>For empathy, Diane found it came from the ‘check-in calls’ with her team. “These are not about business, but about asking how everyone is doing,” she says. It was two months in when a team member realised that Diane always checked how everyone else was, but never shared how she was doing. “I didn’t expect it, but I decided I was going to be vulnerable and tell him that my sister-in-law had been in intensive care for a while and that it was very serious.” It’s this vulnerability that Diane thinks makes better leaders. “It shows humanity, and as a team, we become closer,” she says.</p>
<p>When not staring in the face of a global pandemic, Diane is a keen advocate for targets in the diversity and inclusion space. “The reason I’m a fan of targets is because you won’t know if you’re making progress if you don’t have a tangible metric to focus on,” she explains.</p>
<p>It’s all well and good having conversations around the topic, but if in five years’ time there’s still no progress with hiring or promoting minority candidates, then the conversations would not have been very helpful. The benefits of having diverse teams is that this allows for diversity of thought, broader skillsets and backgrounds that can help HSBC offer better solutions to its customers. As Diane explains, the customers make the bank. “I’ve seen a positive difference when we’ve implemented targets and included them on management scorecards,” she says. “They are an important part of building the right culture, where people are included and where they can speak up, which is what enables you to deliver the best outcomes for your customers.”</p>

<p>Meena Dafesh is Director of Treasury, Asia Pacific at Ingram Micro Asia Pacific, a Fortune 100 company and the world’s largest technology distributor. Dafesh has responsibility for the treasury function across Asia Pacific, and more recently Middle East and Africa. She has been with Ingram Micro for over seven years and is currently based in Singapore. Prior to that she held various treasury roles while based in her native Sydney. Dafesh is Certified Practising Accountant (CPA) (CPA Australia) registered and holds a Bachelor’s degree in Business (Accounting and Finance) from the University of Technology, Sydney.</p>

<h5 id="what-is-your-career-defining-moment">What is your career defining moment?</h5>
<p>Early in my treasury career, I was thrown into the deep end by my boss, which forced me to work things out for myself. I spent five years building up basic treasury skills and laying the foundations of my career. My second career-defining moment was moving from managing treasury at a country level to managing a region. This was a big challenge and outside my comfort zone, not so much in terms of treasury but more in terms of working across different cultures.</p>
<h5 id="which-women-in-business-most-inspire-you-and-why">Which women in business most inspire you and why?</h5>
<p>There are some amazing women who run large corporations such as Marissa Mayer, CEO at Yahoo!, and Indra Nooyi, CEO of Pepsi Co. But I am also impressed with the “real” women I see on a daily basis. Some of the women I work with juggle work, children and home life, and also contribute to the community – these women are also inspiring.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-the-biggest-challenge-you-are-facing-just-now">What is the biggest challenge you are facing just now?</h5>
<p>Integrating the treasury functions of two recent acquisitions is the biggest challenge I face today. Although I have been involved in a number of acquisitions in the past, the integration work has not been on this scale before.</p>
<h5 id="what-couldnt-you-manage-without">What couldn’t you manage without?</h5>
<p>The people I work with, including those in the regional and global treasury functions, as well as the other business units that treasury works with. My interaction with the business determines the success of treasury, so I couldn’t manage without them. In addition, I couldn’t manage without the strong relationships that we have built with our key banks; they provide us with invaluable support, specifically when entering new markets.</p>
<h5 id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-other-women-in-treasury">What advice would you give to other women in treasury?</h5>
<p>I would advise planning your career from an experience perspective and not base your decisions on remuneration. If your experience is broad across all areas of treasury and you also have in-depth knowledge, then the money will follow. Too many times I have seen people specialise in one area of treasury (such as cash management or FX) because they are following the money instead of looking for the right experience.</p>
<h5 id="what-would-you-have-done-differently-if-you-could">What would you have done differently if you could?</h5>
<p>The only thing I can think of is learning another language – Mandarin would be my first choice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If your experience is broad across all areas of treasury and you also have in-depth knowledge, then the money will follow.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although her job title covers the Asia Pacific region, Meena Dafesh has recently seen her responsibilities expand to include the Middle East and Africa, following two recent acquisitions by the world’s largest wholesale technology distributor Ingram Micro.</p>
<p>Dafesh joined Ingram Micro in 2005 as Treasury Manager for its Australian business, based in Sydney. Eighteen months later, she was promoted to a regional position in the treasury team for the Asia Pacific region, based in Singapore. She was senior manager for about four years before taking up her current position as Director of Treasury.</p>
<p>“When you are working in a regional office in Asia Pacific, you cover a number of countries,” she notes, pointing out that dealing with different cultures can be a challenge. “I think the best thing to do is to try to be humble and realise that there is a lot to learn from the people around you. I didn’t come in with an attitude that I knew everything and I was open to learning from my co-workers in these countries, who in return have been very supportive.”</p>
<p>Dafesh faces a further challenge, as not only does she have to tackle the relatively large Asia Pacific region, she is now responsible for two geographical areas which are new to her in terms of banking and regulatory environment.</p>
<p>“It has been interesting to say the least, but I like a challenge,” she says. “It has been a fascinating journey, discovering how Middle Eastern and African countries operate in terms of treasury and regulatory frameworks. It has certainly been a steep learning curve. I have embraced the expanded remit along with the challenges and opportunities it brings, and importantly, I have a great team to support me.”</p>
<p>Born in the Middle East, she moved to Australia when she was very young. Dafesh entered the treasury sector through a twist of fate rather than as a planned career move. She was working in a small public accounting company as a junior accountant, doing the books for a few clients; but a few months into the job, she realised that it was not for her.</p>
<p>She applied for an accounting position with Hutchison Telecommunications in Sydney, hoping that accounting in a corporate environment may be far more interesting, but was offered a treasury position instead. And she has not looked back since. “I took the chance and it was the best decision I ever made. I have been in treasury for the past 13 years and I love it.” She is not shy to admit that she is one of those “fortunate people who love their work”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The best thing to do is to try to be humble and realise that there is a lot to learn from the people around you.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what does Dafesh like about treasury? “The diversity of the work. There are so many things happening. You are juggling a number of balls in the air at the same time, whether in cash or debt management, or negotiating with the banks, as well as talking to the business about funding needs.”</p>
<p>And it does not stop there, especially with an expanded geographical remit. She is now busy integrating the new acquisitions’ treasury activities.</p>
<p>Moving to Singapore to take up a regional post at Ingram Micro was the easiest thing Dafesh has done, she says. “Singapore is such an effortless place to settle in, as everything is easily accessible. The vibrancy of the city is appealing to me as I grew up in a similar environment in Sydney. The lifestyle is great,” she notes.</p>
<p>Dafesh achieved her accountancy education in a different way to most of her counterparts. She did her first year at university as a full-time student but switched to part-time studies the following year, graduating from the University of Technology, Sydney.</p>
<p>“I decided to get a full-time job in accounting while I did the rest of my degree part-time. Training while on the job made sense to me because I believe that there is no point in learning without applying what I had learnt. I needed my education to be relevant, to be able to apply it and see the purpose of what I was learning. This path of development really worked well for me,” she said.</p>
<p>So what new challenges lie ahead for her? “The next 12 months will be about integration and ensuring the treasury function continues to support the business during a time of change and opportunities,” she explains.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Professor Alyson Warhurst stresses the importance of academic training and promotes PhDs, especially for women.  She believes that personal success is derived from talent and expertise, luck and a good mentor.</p>
<br/><div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Professor Alyson Warhurst</h4>
<h5 class="title">Chief Executive Officer</h5>
<img alt="Maplecroft" class="logo org" height="38" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/maplecroft-logo-2013-100x38.png" width="100"/>
<p>Alyson Warhurst is CEO and Founder of risk analysis and mapping company Maplecroft. Over the past ten years she has built Maplecroft into the leading source of extra-financial risk intelligence for the world’s largest multinational corporations; banks and asset managers; governments and NGOs. Coming from an academic background, she now advises global companies and organisations at board level on issues including: global and political risks, human rights, ethical supply chains, corporate reputation and corporate social responsibility (CSR). Warhurst is a consultant to the World Economic Forum (WEF), where she is also part of the faculty; she is a member of Clinton Global Initiative and on the Board of Trustees at Transparency International UK. From 1999 to 2009 Warhurst was Chair of Strategy and International Development at Warwick Business School, where she won the inaugural Faculty Pioneer ‘Beyond Grey Pinstripes Award’ (called by the FT the “Business School Oscars”), regularly won the ‘Outstanding Teacher Award’ and was made an Honorary Professor in 2010. She is an accomplished speaker at high-level international events and has written several books and more than 100 articles, including a regular column for Business Week. In 2010 Warhurst was a recipient of a Business Insurance Magazine ‘Women to Watch’ award.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-is-your-career-defining-moment">What is your career-defining moment?</h5>
<p>It was when I recognised that risk can and must be brought to life through mapping and measuring complex issues in challenging geographies.</p>
<h5 id="which-woman-in-business-most-inspires-you-and-why">Which woman in business most inspires you and why?</h5>
<p>There are three women that have a broad influence on me: Aung San Suu Kyi, who is an inspiration for standing by her principles, as well as her understanding of the importance of responsible business in rebuilding her country; Hilary Clinton for her understanding of the importance of human rights, especially those affecting women in Africa; and the Body Shop’s Founder Anita Roddick for her influential teaching style and product innovation.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-the-biggest-challenge-you-are-facing-just-now">What is the biggest challenge you are facing just now?</h5>
<p>Running a business as it grows and moves into second-stage growth is very challenging, especially in today’s economic climate. It requires hard work and 24/7 engagement.</p>
<h5 id="what-couldnt-you-manage-without">What couldn’t you manage without?</h5>
<p>I could not be without a brilliant senior team and the loyal and competent employees and colleagues that have been with us from the beginning.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-your-next-major-objective">What is your next major objective?</h5>
<p>We are an ambitious business. The next major objective is to realise the goal of becoming the world leader in risk mapping, analysis and political risk advisory services.</p>
<h5 id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-other-women-in-treasury">What advice would you give to other women in treasury?</h5>
<p>There is no substitute for hard work and achievement. Criticisms and obstacles are often put in your way, so it is important not to allow those things to tie you up. There is no substitute for putting your head down, working hard and letting the end results speak for themselves. I am a real believer in building careers one brick at a time, ensuring that you move on to the next brick and keep moving upwards. Finding a good mentor is paramount to guide you through this process.</p>
<h5 id="if-there-is-one-thing-you-could-have-done-differently-in-your-career-path-so-far-what-would-that-be">If there is one thing you could have done differently in your career path so far, what would that be?</h5>
<p>If I could have done things differently, I would have written more books. At the pinnacle of my career as a professor, I still had a lot of writing to do which I believe would have had an impact. But I chose to build a business instead and it is difficult to do both at the same time. When I retire from business, I would like to write – but perhaps by then it might be a more creative novel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There is no substitute for putting your head down, working hard and letting the end results speak for themselves.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Professor Alyson Warhurst began her career in academia with a geology and geography degree, moving into political science and international relations and completed a PhD with a large amount of field work in Latin America. “The challenge I set myself was exploring why there had been no success in transforming the mineral wealth of the Andes into economic wealth for the countries it touches (Bolivia, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru and Chile), in the same way that Canada and the US transformed the Rockies from natural to national wealth. This main thesis has been something that has intrigued me throughout my academic career,” she explains.</p>
<p>Warhurst distinguished herself as an academic and became the youngest UK business school professor at the time she was appointed Chair of the Bath School of Management in 1994. Five years later, she was awarded a Chair at Warwick Business School where she set up a corporate citizenship unit. She had fairly large teams of researchers who worked on various types of PhDs to understand business influences in emerging markets and what made for business/government/society success in these areas.</p>
<p>At Warwick she taught an MBA module on business and society, which came first out of 92 different modules that were undertaken at Warwick, something which she is extremely proud of. “I received the outstanding teacher award every year and that really mattered to me,” Warhurst says. However, her teaching experience made her realise that when teaching it is critical to bring words to life and in order to learn students have to be enjoying themselves. “I came up with the concept of mapping risk, which builds on my geography background. The concept is based on using visually compelling ways of presenting data in charts and maps to explain risk and a range of different issues relevant to the complex emerging markets business environment,” she explains. She attributes this insight as her “career-defining moment”.</p>
<p>The concept was also based on many years living and working in China, Myanmar, parts of Africa and virtually every country in Latin America. “Words just don’t do that business environment justice, so I developed a visual alternative,” she says.</p>
<p>When Warhurst reached 50 she took early retirement, so she changed course in 2005 and committed to working with business and life partner, Ed Cole, in developing software and mapping applications. She started working full-time as CEO of Maplecroft from 2009. Since then the company has grown by 40% and now employs 100 people. She believes that the company is successful despite the recession because “everyone wants/needs to understand risk in emerging economies”.</p>
<p>In her day-to-day work, Warhurst has worked hard in the last year to build up a senior team of 12 people. Her three key areas of responsibility are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Business development: she still enjoys travelling and meeting new people to expand the business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintain quality and ensure career development; peer reviews; and ensuring talent development across the business with a strong emphasis on research quality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Business strategy; ensuring that the strategic aims of the business are met.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>“I don’t have my eyes just on revenue but also on valuation,” she says. “It is about ensuring revenues are high and that they keep growing and are sufficient.” She is very comfortable taking risks so the company is not yet in profit because the revenue is invested in building the business and new areas of research and innovation. “I am a strong believer in R&amp;D and maintaining everything so there isn’t a day that goes by that we are not innovating in one way or another.” Valuation is also important to Warhurst, ensuring that the company has long-term contracts, a good senior team and that the business is on sound ground and has all the right indicators.</p>
<p>She believes academic training is important and promotes PhDs, especially for women. “A PhD is a formidable building block in any career and a great accomplishment,” she says and looks for this when recruiting, as well as often suggesting a PhD when giving career advice. “You have to achieve a certain standard in terms of understanding methodology and innovating with respect to methodology after having spent time out in the field. All the ingredients in producing a successful PhD are the ingredients I look for in employees.”</p>
<p>Warhurst is mindful of gender balance in her company and of ensuring that the support is there across the board, taking into account the special situation that women find themselves when they are building their careers. She believes that personal success is derived from talent and expertise, luck and a good mentor. “You need all three – one on its own is not sufficient,” she says.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Marie-Astrid Dubois, Assistant Treasurer EMEA and Asia, Honeywell, shares her professional path, career-defining moments and passion for treasury.</p>
<br/><div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Marie-Astrid Dubois</h4>
<h5 class="title">Assistant Treasurer EMEA and Asia</h5>
<img alt="Honeywell" class="logo org" height="17" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/honeywell-red-logo-2013-90x17.png" width="90"/>
<p>Marie-Astrid Dubois joined Honeywell in 2002 as Director Europe Treasury. She was appointed Assistant Treasurer EMEA and Asia in 2006. In this role, she leads all operational and strategic treasury activities, spanning from cash and liquidity management, trade finance, euro commercial paper (ECP) and risk management to strategic projects for these two regions, in which Honeywell is present in about 60 countries. Dubois has been involved with numerous merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) and divestment projects, as well as their funding structure and smooth integration in Honeywell’s treasury operations. During her tenure, her team won the Alexander Hamilton Gold Award for Cash Management two years in a row, one for Asia and the other for EMEA, as well as a number of other treasury awards both in Asia and Europe. Prior to joining Honeywell, Dubois worked for ACNielsen, the Dexter Corporation and Arthur Andersen. She has more than 20 years of experience in treasury and risk management.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-is-your-career-defining-moment">What is your career-defining moment?</h5>
<p>Despite always wanting to stay in Europe, my career-defining moment was when I accepted a job at the Dexter Corporation in Connecticut, US. I discovered a company culture that is better suited to my personality and since then I have only worked for US multinationals.</p>
<h5 id="which-woman-in-business-most-inspires-you-and-why">Which woman in business most inspires you and why?</h5>
<p>Christine Lagarde because she has an impressive career, as the first female Chairman of the international law firm Baker &amp; McKenzie, then as Minister of Finance for France and finally as Managing Director of the IMF. She successfully manages the demands of a family and such a successful career.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-the-biggest-challenge-you-are-facing-just-now">What is the biggest challenge you are facing just now?</h5>
<p>It is important to be a catalyst for change. I strive to add value by finding the most efficient way to support the businesses lines and encourage my team to connect with the business lines in their locations. I also need to manage constrained resources in the most appropriate way.</p>
<h5 id="what-couldnt-you-manage-without">What couldn’t you manage without?</h5>
<p>I couldn’t manage without my Executive Assistant, who knows how to manage me. In addition, I would be lost without my passion to constantly challenge the status quo. I need to know that each team member is evolving – if I wasn’t seeing positive change, I would find it quite difficult.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-your-next-major-objective">What is your next major objective?</h5>
<p>Honeywell is working towards a SWIFT implementation and we are looking at setting up a payment-on-behalf-of factory. My objective is to successfully drive that forward by working with people in different functions and business units.</p>
<h5 id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-other-women-in-treasury">What advice would you give to other women in treasury?</h5>
<p>The importance of networking should be part of any advice. It is also important to publicise your achievements, both internally and externally through treasury awards, for example. Women are less vocal about their achievements than men – an area we need to improve upon.</p>
<h5 id="if-there-is-one-thing-you-could-have-done-differently-in-your-career-path-so-far-what-would-that-be">If there is one thing you could have done differently in your career path so far, what would that be?</h5>
<p>I can’t think of anything that I would have done differently. I love treasury, even though I came to it by chance. I don’t really believe in planning a career because you should be on the lookout for new opportunities when they appear.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I would be lost without my passion to constantly challenge the status quo.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like many others in the treasury field, Marie-Astrid Dubois says that she fell into the profession “by chance”. She started her career at Arthur Andersen in France and worked on a special mandate for US clients which involved the Dexter Corporation. After completing the assignment successfully, Dexter offered her a job in the US as part of a management development programme. Through the programme, the company identified and hired bright people to serve as a reserve army for special projects. Dubois was the first non-Anglophone to be hired as part of the programme.</p>
<p>“When you are the only employee that is non-Anglophone – and also a woman – then you can feel a bit isolated, but at the same time that is what makes you special,” she says. In what she describes as a career-defining moment, the move internationalised her career and she found a US multinational that best fit her personality. “My boss believed in talented people and wanted to give them every opportunity to shine,” she says. “That sponsorship helped to build up my self-confidence.” It also provided her with different opportunities, which in turn allowed Dubois to have the type of career she wanted.</p>
<p>Although she was offered a number of domestic jobs, Dubois was keen to move back to Europe. When Dexter’s CFO decided to start up its international treasury operations by opening a treasury centre in Brussels, Belgium, this was her opportunity to return and also move into treasury. Although not a planned career move, she thoroughly enjoys treasury and has made it her career. In 1997, she moved to ACNielsen and was responsible for Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) treasury. She joined Honeywell in 2002 as Director Europe Treasury and was promoted to Assistant Treasurer EMEA and Asia in 2006.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Part of the challenge, in an environment where resources are very constrained, is how to allocate the right level of resources and determine which area has priority.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dubois’ day-to-day job is to stay abreast of everything that is happening in the market. At the same time, she is focused on moving her team up the ladder. “My team are my ears and eyes around the world,” she says. Honeywell’s international treasury covers more than 60 countries. In Europe the team is located in four different countries: Germany, UK, France and Belgium, where Honeywell’s in-house bank is located. In Asia the team is based in Singapore and Shanghai.</p>
<p>“An important aspect of my job is to stay connected with the business leaders to ensure that we are supporting their needs and develop solutions for them. Part of the challenge, in an environment where resources are very constrained, is how to allocate the right level of resources and determine which area has priority. In addition, I need to ensure that my team is where I want them, to be able to add value to the business,” she says. Networking – with banks, vendors, consultants and other treasury professionals – is another important part of her job.</p>
<p>With regard to education and development, Dubois places more emphasis on hands on experience rather than a formal certification programme. After receiving an MBA from IESE, University of Navarra, Spain, her career has mainly been driven by her insatiable curiosity and she looks for that characteristic in other people. “I don’t require my team to have a treasury certificate per se, but I do push them to understand the technicalities of the job,” she says. She emphasises building up expertise and sharing best practice within the team. For example, recently she brought two members of the team in Asia to Europe for two weeks of intense training.</p>
<p>Dubois values the level of support that her boss and the CFO give her at Honeywell, as well as other mentors along the way. Honeywell has a mentoring programme that targets top talent in the finance department and she is committed to mentoring across the organisation, as well as her own team through actively managing them. “It has become more difficult to attract good individuals, so we need to ensure that we develop, coach, train and mentor them,” she says.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Sophia Porcelli has been involved with the transformation of AkzoNobel’s Asian treasury operations as an integral part of the group’s mandate.</p><br/><div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Sophia Porcelli</h4>
<h5 class="title">Director Treasury, Asia Pacific</h5>
<img alt="AkzoNobel" class="logo org" height="52" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/akzonobel-logo-2011-90x52.png" width="90"/>
<p>Sophia Porcelli is the Director Treasury Asia Pacific for AkzoNobel, the world’s largest global paints and coatings company, and a leader in specialty chemicals. Sophia was born in Hong Kong and educated in the UK. During her tenure with the company, Sophia has worked in various regional and global financial roles on several international assignments. Taking on diverse posts across both emerging and mature markets has given Sophia variety in her work and makes her a seasoned financial professional. She believes that career progression and success comes from being customer focused, clear about what you want and ensuring there is balance in your life. Sophia shares her passion for cooking and travel with her French-born Italian South African husband.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-is-your-career-defining-moment">What is your career defining moment?</h5>
<p>There have been several exciting challenges but the most recent was the opportunity to move into treasury without a specialised treasury background. Apart from the valuable chance to learn, it opened a whole new discipline up to me while continuing to engage businesses internally. Plus, now I work with people outside the company and have expanded my external peer network cross industries.</p>
<h5 id="which-women-in-business-most-inspire-you-and-why">Which women in business most inspire you and why?</h5>
<p>Women that contribute beyond their own expert function and are leaders in a wider corporate or community context. These women give more than their technical knowledge and concentrate their passion, energy and drive on helping others.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-the-biggest-challenge-you-are-facing-just-now">What is the biggest challenge you are facing just now?</h5>
<p>Part of treasury’s challenge is to understand the business environment. In AkzoNobel, we like to position ourselves as close partners with the businesses. That creates a window conducive for cross-learning: we can learn more about the businesses and at the same time share our knowledge on treasury products and services. The challenge is to cultivate cross-learning whilst embracing change and delivering sustainable benefits at the same time.</p>
<p>The other challenge is the global economic situation, so treasury needs to be mindful of external risks. We are based in an emerging market with pockets of good news, which we need to capitalise on. Change is constant and that gives us greater opportunity to thrive.</p>
<h5 id="what-couldnt-you-manage-without">What couldn’t you manage without?</h5>
<p>The first thing that comes to mind is being part of a supportive and diverse team in the workplace. To work with collaborative colleagues and learn from each other is fantastic.</p>
<h5 id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-other-women-in-treasury">What advice would you give to other women in treasury?</h5>
<p>Be clear about why you are in treasury – that means understanding your own contribution to the discipline, your team and vice versa. It’s not always explicit. And you should have one eye out for the next move. Be in control of your career development is my advice.</p>
<h5 id="if-there-is-one-thing-you-could-have-done-differently-in-your-career-path-so-far-what-would-that-be">If there is one thing you could have done differently in your career path so far, what would that be?</h5>
<p>I have thought long and hard on this question, but I can’t think of anything. If you are asking whether if I had to replay what I did, would I do the same? Yes, I would, absolutely.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I had the opportunity to visit different parts of the company, talk to all levels of management and see best practices first hand.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sophia Porcelli has been involved with the transformation of AkzoNobel’s Asian treasury operations as an integral part of the group’s mandate. This includes implementing new treasury platforms, setting up a shared service centre starting with payment factory and streamlining the number of banking partners.</p>
<p>“We are on a journey,” she says. “We have increasing visibility and control over our treasury processes and liquidity.” With the technical design established, treasury is now on-boarding business units in a phased manner in order to operate more centrally using standardised tools and processes and realise cost savings.</p>
<p>The other exciting part of the journey has been building the treasury team. “When I first returned to Singapore in mid-2009, I was the only one here and today we have eight people. In addition, the team in China has grown from two to six,” Porcelli explains. “We went through a recruitment drive, partly to staff the new operating model, but also to gain more expertise in the team to serve our growing businesses.” She herself chose treasury after an internal audit role because it allows room to grow in terms of knowledge and also greater interaction with business, especially at senior management level, both in and outside the company. She considers this key to being a seasoned finance professional.</p>
<p>Porcelli began her career with a Big Four audit practice in London. After qualifying as a chartered accountant, she was recruited by Courtaulds, a former UK listed manufacturer of coatings and chemicals, now part of AkzoNobel, to work as an internal financial consultant. This meant being a global trotter filling in temporary vacant financial positions in the group and working as an extra pair of hands for specific projects.</p>
<p>“This proved to be an excellent entry point from the Big Four into the corporate world,” says Porcelli. “It was fun to travel up to a few months at a time. I gained a lot of exposure and attracted the interest of different people within the organisation.”</p>
<p>Courtaulds’ development programme involved recruiting people and then placing them into more permanent “proper jobs”. At the end of an 18-month stint, Porcelli was offered a regional finance manager position based in Singapore. In that role, she worked on financial consolidation and also led an ERP implementation project. This led to her next position of heading the internal audit team. She cautions, however, that moving around as a female lead spouse has its challenges as well as rewards, and this is something young women looking for international careers need to consider.</p>
<p>At that time AkzoNobel, a Dutch-owned company, acquired Courtaulds. “I was in a great position, leading a growing young talented team. I had the opportunity to visit different parts of the company, engage all levels of management and see best practices first hand. I even visited selective customers. As AkzoNobel has a diverse business portfolio, such cross-business unit exposure is invaluable,” says Porcelli. “In 2007 I was offered a job in treasury, based in the Netherlands, and I took it.”</p>
<p>Porcelli identifies the move into treasury as a career defining moment. She also values being able to move around in different positions within a multinational company. “I really encourage employees and hiring managers, in whatever function, to maximise that,” she says. “Being in different work settings meant the need to adapt, overcome challenges and develop attributes. It is enriching.”</p>
<p>Career development is an important focus for Porcelli. She encourages people to find their own mentors, within the company or outside of it. “I think the relationship (internal versus external mentors) could be different and I have been fortunate to have both at different stages of my career,” she says. “It is important to have someone you are comfortable with but who challenges your line of thinking. They should be able to give you a different perspective that you are not able to see for yourself.” She points out that the strongest mentor-mentee relationship is one of mutual benefit and perspective sharing.</p>
<p>When asked where to find a mentor, she suggests looking for people that you aspire to be, not necessarily from the corporate world, and then be “thick skinned and just ask them”. “Compare where you are and where they are – and work out what needs to be done in order to get there,” she explains.</p></div>
