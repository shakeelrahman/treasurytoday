<p>EBITDA represents a company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. It is an accounting measure calculated using a company’s earnings, before interest expenses, taxes, depreciation and amortisation are subtracted, as a proxy for a company’s current operating profitability. Because the margin ignores the impacts of non-operating factors such as interest expenses, taxes, or intangible assets, the result is a metric that is a more accurate reflection of a firm’s operating profitability.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>

<h4 id="in-house-bank-ihb">In-house bank (IHB)</h4>
<p>In-house bank (IHB) is a powerful set of processes and systems that help MNCs increase efficiency, reduce risk, and tighten control. Implemented properly, IHB centralises foreign exchange, funding (and with it interest rate risk), liquidity, intercompany, payments and collections. If that sounds like a big deal – it is!</p>
<p>The term “In-house bank” is loosely used in two ways.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Some people use IHB to refer to treasury centres, which typically transact intercompany loans, deposits, and FX with subsidiaries (who continue to use stand-alone banks accounts and so forth).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IHB as discussed here is anchored by the use of (multi-currency) intercompany current accounts that replace bank accounts altogether for operating subsidiaries.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In full IHB, operating subsidiaries have no bank accounts in their own name at all – they do all their payments and collections through their IHB intercompany current accounts.</p>
<p>The table below compares certain aspects of operating subsidiary processes standalone vs treasury centre vs IHB:</p>
<p><a href="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/treasury-practice/tools/point-of-view-chart.png?la=en&amp;hash=222772E4647CCD21D5B6DA03FF69A07F"><img alt="operating subsidiary processes standalone vs treasury centre vs IHB" height="" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/treasury-practice/tools/point-of-view-chart.png?la=en&amp;hash=222772E4647CCD21D5B6DA03FF69A07F" title="operating subsidiary processes standalone vs treasury centre vs IHB" width="400"/></a></p>
<p class="source"><em>ICA=Intercompany Current Account</em></p>
<h4 id="scope">Scope</h4>
<p>As will be apparent from the above, IHB is the ultimate treasury centralisation tool. As such, the scope of IHB can be very wide, and the implementation correspondingly complex, especially in restricted markets.</p>
<p>Whereas connecting operating subsidiaries to a treasury centre typically shifts their wholesale banking needs (loans, deposits, FX) from banks to treasury centre, full IHB centralises all operating subsidiary banking needs.</p>
<p>Not all IHB implementations include all possible aspects of IHB but here are some of the operating subsidiary activities that are often included:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Loans/funding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deposits/investing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liquidity management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FX risk management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IR risk management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Payments on behalf (including payroll, administrative and statutory payments).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Receivable/collections on behalf.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intercompany settlement (balance netting through intercompany current accounts, as opposed to payment netting).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Many IHBs additionally provide business support services in the financial aspects of contracting such as FX and counterparty risk, subsidiary capital structure, and taxation of financial transactions. IHBs often centralise and manage guarantees for operating companies in businesses where this is pertinent.</p>
<h4 id="regulations">Regulations</h4>
<p>Given the scope of IHB, regulatory constraints are a major issue in restricted country roll outs. Countries in Asia often present regulatory challenges. The consensus is that only five countries in Asia qualify as light regulation markets – Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. In these countries, full IHB is possible (though quirks in Japan’s domestic practices – for example, statutory payments – can be challenging for holistic payments on behalf).</p>
<p>The regulations that most constrain IHB include exchange controls, capital structure limitations, regulatory bank accounts and so forth. In general, IHB implementations work with local regulators, advisors, and banking partners to optimise processes in order to achieve maximum efficiency while complying with regulatory constraints.</p>
<p>As an example, countries that do not allow netting of cross border flows often allow aggregation of inflows and outflows separately – aka gross in/gross out – which still allows considerable cost savings and control improvements.</p>
<p>Another example is agency dealing where intercompany FX is not allowed.</p>
<h4 id="tax">Tax</h4>
<p>All cross border treasury operations have tax impacts (as do some domestic ones). IHB is normally more focussed on cost and control than on tax, and IHBs tend not to generate massive profits because of their focus on processes and control, but clearly tax can be a significant cost element. Massive profit shifting using intercompany loans at off market rates is largely a thing of the past, after a decade of global focus on BEPS (base erosion and profit shifting).</p>
<p>Recently, under the auspices of the OECD, 130 countries have signed up for a “bold new framework for international tax reform” of which a 15% minimum corporate income tax rate is a corner stone. There is some speculation that this might reduce the attractiveness of low tax jurisdictions for IHB. From an Asian perspective, Singapore and Hong Kong – the preeminent IHB locations – are indeed low tax jurisdictions, but IHBs are normally located there because of their centrality to Asia, their deep and broad financial markets and talent pools, rather than to shelter profits.</p>
<p>Given the importance of intercompany funding in IHB (bank balances and loans are replaced by intercompany balances in the intercompany current accounts), withholding taxes on related party interest can be a material issue. This drives Asian IHBs to Singapore and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Transfer pricing can be an issue for IHBs both in terms of market rates and service charges. The key here is to follow well documented arm’s length pricing. The efforts of the past decade of work on BEPS has made transfer pricing a hot topic with many tax authorities, but it has also often brought clarity as to what is acceptable (for example, through precedence). Bank pricing may not be considered fair between related parties. In some cases, the tax authorities on each side of transactions may not agree about what constitutes fair pricing. Mostly these issues can be resolved with open communication with the relevant authorities.</p>
<h4 id="technology">Technology</h4>
<p>Although one can demonstrate IHB process arithmetic in Excel, in practice, IHB requires robust technology to succeed. Mostly, this takes the form of ERPs or TMSs. Some companies have developed IHB functionality in house, but commercial software for IHB is such a well-developed market that building rather than buying probably does not make sense for most MNCs.</p>
<p>For corporates using a single instance or well-integrated ERP that has IHB functionality, this is often the path of least resistance. It should be noted however that buying and implementing the required modules can be surprisingly expensive and time consuming – it is normally not just a question of flipping a switch.</p>
<p>For corporates whose ERP does not support IHB or who have heterogenous accounting systems, a TMS can provide the glue and requisite functionality to support an IHB implementation. Implementing a TMS will normally be cheaper and simpler than implementing a new ERP, and many groups use specialised ERPs that are necessary for their specific business processes.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>Despite the challenges in regulated countries, IHB is a powerful tool to reduce costs and improve controls. Hundreds of IHBs are operating successfully across Asia, and many more are in implementation. Although IHB is not a quick and easy fix, the rewards are worth the effort. Detailed planning and investigation, as well as solid advice and open dealing with regulators, help to ensure successful outcomes.</p>

<p>The cash conversion cycle (CCC) is a metric that defines the time (in days) it takes for a company to convert its inventory and other resources into cash from sales. It is sometimes also called the Net Operating Cycle or simply Cash Cycle, CCC attempts to measure how long each dollar is tied up in the production and sales process before it gets converted into a cash receivable.</p>
<p>CCC takes into account how much time the company needs to sell its inventory, how much time it takes to collect the receivables, and how much time it has to pay its bills without incurring penalties and is one of several key performance indicators (KPIs) that help evaluate the efficiency of a company's operations and management.</p>

<p>Corporate treasury involves building relationships with a wide range of people from lenders to investors, credit-rating agencies to regulators as well as colleagues and partners less versed in finance’s complex lexicon and anacronym soup. It leaves treasury often responsible for explaining technical terms with clarity and ensuring all partners are on the same page. None more than when working with people in a different language and across different cultures, where divergent understanding of a shared term can seriously complicate communication.</p>
<p>Indeed, those taking their first step into treasury can often feel like they are learning a whole new language. Treasury’s vocabulary is constantly growing as the profession evolves; add in the fact some important financial words have multiple meanings in different contexts, and we thought it was time to help!</p>
<p>Back by popular demand after a ten-year absence, Treasury Today is dusting off the mothballs of Calculator Corner and re-launching our quick guide to treasury terminology. Every month, we’ll explain either a financial term in Calculator Corner or an abbreviation in the Abbreviation Arena via motion graphic. From calculating working capital to the different ways to measure the average rate of return on an investment; from an explanation of EAR to clarity on EBITDA, treasury’s complex terms, all will become clear. First up will be next week’s explanation of how to calculate the debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio.</p>

<p><em>Identifying and maintaining authorised resolution and account signers is a common challenge for treasurers – but Bank of America’s new CashPro Assistant skill for authority management turns the traditional approach on its head. Jennifer Boussuge, Global Head of Treasury Fulfilment Service Operations within Global Technology &amp; Operations, and Linda Haddad, Global Product Head for CashPro Assistant, explain why the tool is needed, how it works, and how the rollout is progressing.</em></p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Managing who has access and authority for maintaining bank relationship, accounts, services and in general to conduct business on behalf of their company has long been a challenge for corporate treasurers. From initially adding these authorised individuals, and then maintaining the list over the life of their bank relationship, authority management is a complex, monotonous paper-based process that has an incredible opportunity to evolve with the digital age. At times the process may even involve sourcing replacement documentation when the authority list gets out of synch over time.</p>
<p>To compound the challenge, when corporate treasures are prompted by their own auditors or policy to provide evidence of the authorities related to their bank relationship, they will need to work with the bank to recreate a view that at times may be many years old, using a paper-based process.</p>
<p>Other shortcomings of traditional approaches to authority management include repetitive data collection, signature sample capture, and jurisdictional requirements for individual Know Your Customer (KYC), which may include personal identifying information (PII).</p>
<p>Given these challenges, there is plenty of room for improvement. Over the last couple of years, Bank of America has, in consultation with clients, devised a new way of approaching this topic. The resulting authority management skill added to CashPro Assistant has been successfully released in EMEA and is now being rolled out in North America.</p>
<h3 id="todays-authority-management-the-challenges">Today’s authority management: the challenges</h3>
<p>“Traditional signer maintenance is time-consuming and entails a myriad of extensive, manual processes for clients and banks alike,” says Jennifer Boussuge, Global Head of Treasury Fulfilment Service Operations within Global Technology &amp; Operations at Bank of America. “We’ve challenged the status quo by creating streamlined, digital efficiencies clients will benefit from tremendously.”</p>
<p>When companies open an account, they must inform banks who their authorised signers are for actions such as signing documents and cheques. Typically this is done using a paper signature card which is passed to the bank. The bank then scans it and adds it as an image onto a repository or database that can be accessed internally.</p>
<p>“Many clients have multiple accounts with us, with the same set of signers for every account,” Boussuge explains. “So if you have 100 accounts, a bank can request the same signature card, with the same signature samples, 100 times.”</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Keeping authority profile records for accounts up to date is a similarly inefficient process for both banks and organisations. “Many of our clients do not have a centralised location for accessing this information,” explains Linda Haddad, the bank’s Global Product Head for CashPro Assistant. “It’s difficult for clients to determine their total bank account population, let alone who has which authorisation on those accounts.”</p>
<p>Compounding the challenge, treasury teams don’t always remember to keep their banks informed about changes to their authorised signers – as Boussuge points out, “the question of who is authorised is very much a part of a client’s own process and policies. Inevitably the bank can become a second thought, which means we get out of sync very quickly.”</p>
<p>With no means of automatic records synchronisation by the bank and by the company, challenges can arise when companies need to request signer details from the bank, for example when an audit is required. Traditionally, accessing this information from a bank can take days or even weeks – and when banks do provide signer information, it will often be inaccurate. In today’s global economy, the complexity can be all the greater when reviews encompass different regions.</p>
<h3 id="rethinking-the-process">Rethinking the process</h3>
<p>To tackle these issues, Bank of America engaged a pool of clients to help design a new approach. The result: CashPro Assistant authority management, a new skill that will ultimately be available to all CashPro clients.</p>
<p>“We had been hearing feedback from clients and operations about the manual, paper-based aspect of signer management, and we decided to do something about it,” says Haddad. “We formed a cross-business team that included some of our key clients, with the objective of simplifying the tracking, modifying and reporting of signatory authorisations. CashPro Assistant authority management is that re-imagined solution.”</p>
<p>Crucially, the new approach involves organising authority management not by account, but by signer. “Rather than having one signature card with a list of signers for each account, we thought, ‘What if we create one signer profile per person, and then add and remove accounts that are assigned to that person?’” says Boussuge. “Instead of one person providing their signature specimen ten times for ten different accounts, we can now give that individual an authority profile card and then add or remove the ten accounts. The beauty of this solution is the signer only provides their required information and signature specimen once.”</p>
<p>As well as being more efficient than traditional methods, a signer-based approach also addresses privacy issues that can arise when using standard signature cards. “If you pass a signature card within your company to collect signer information and signature specimens, everyone who is on that signature card will see each other’s potentially private information,” says Boussuge.</p>
<p>When authority profiles are organised by signer and stored in an accessible database, individual signers can give the bank their details without sharing them across multiple channels and people.</p>
<h3 id="digitising-the-process">Digitising the process</h3>
<p>Replacing an account-based process with a signer-based process is one part of the new approach. Another piece of the puzzle involves digitising the signature card process and storing signer profile cards not as PDF images, but as data.</p>
<p>“The authority profile card then becomes a data collection device synced through CashPro,” says Boussuge. “The data is stored on a centralised, secure database, which allows us to grant access to necessary teams within the bank, enabling access to a single set of data.”</p>
<p>For example, this means that when a signature needs to be verified, a bank employee can pull the specific information from the database – and the bank can control the details users are entitled to view, protecting potentially sensitive information, such as a driving license.</p>
<p>“The next step is to make the data visible to our clients,” says Haddad. “Through CashPro Assistant, a client can now view their authority profiles we have on file, allowing them to essentially pull a report on all their signers with the click of a button, saving everyone days or possibly weeks.” She adds that when clients want to make a change, they are able to submit simple, digital requests to make changes to their data.</p>
<p>Looking further ahead, Bank of America plans to extend the concept beyond the parameters of signature cards to include other types of authority – such as the authority to submit phone wires, or the named contacts for failed payment files. Finally, the project will see clients being given full control over their data, with the ability to manage their own authority information in real-time and without the need for paper signature card documents to effect changes.</p>
<h3 id="building-connections">Building connections</h3>
<p>As Haddad explains, the ability to connect the client-facing and back-end applications is key to the development and success of the solution. “Often, bank portals aren’t connected to the back-end operation,” she says. “The portal may be great for the client to interact with, but it stops there – and at the back-end, the bank is still operating in the traditional way using paper.”</p>
<p>Bank of America’s approach, conversely, involves directly linking the back-end and client-facing applications, while digitising both of these components. “This means that when the client sends a request to add an authority profile, it is auto-cased and completed often without delay,” says Haddad. “The client can see it in CashPro Assistant at the same time.” She explains that this integrated approach makes the solution scalable for the future, as well as reducing both the need for manual processes and the risk of error.</p>


<h2 class="h3 copy__heading">CashPro Assistant authority management: the low-down</h2>
<p>The new skill includes the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Full authority profile.</h5>
<p>The inclusion of product contacts, payment approvers and access entitlement roles will expand the view of an authority profile, making it inclusive of the full view of authorities an individual holds at the bank.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Signer at the centre.</h5>
<p>CashPro Assistant authority management includes signer profiles for individuals, with accounts added or removed from scope as required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Digitised records.</h5>
<p>Whereas account signature cards have been stored as PDF images, the new process will record signer information as data that is stored on a secure single database – meaning bank users can access single fields as needed, instead of viewing the whole signature card. This removes the potential of oversharing sensitive data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Client access.</h5>
<p>Providing clients with access to the data and the ability to edit it directly will make it much easier for them to run reports, submit change requests and self-manage their authorised signer data.</p>
</li>
</ul>


<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<h3 id="progress-so-far">Progress so far</h3>
<p>The new authority management approach is also about overcoming historical silos. “This is a unique partnership between the front-end client-facing experience, and the bank’s fulfilment operations,” says Boussuge. “The treasury world has historically been very transaction focused – but this moves us to the next frontier, by melding a process that is so painful for clients.”</p>
<p>The development of the solution has been shaped by the bank’s CashPro client advisory board and roundtables, with clients providing feedback on how the experience should be designed. “We had a vision, but the design and evolution of how we actually created this new tool is directly tied to client feedback and interactions over the past three years. They were part of every design decision,” says Haddad.</p>
<h3 id="rolling-out-the-solution">Rolling out the solution</h3>
<p>Bank of America first released CashPro Assistant authority management in March 2020. The first stage of launch was purposefully focused on EMEA, where signer management tends to be more complex than in the US. The launch encompassed both the internal and external applications, with a subset of clients, varying in company size and scope, included in the first instance.</p>
<p>The launch came at a time when the COVID-19 crisis was gaining momentum. If anything, the crisis has accelerated the need for the solution. “We are in a very unique time, when companies are looking for opportunities to digitise anything and everything they can, to best enable their remote workforce,” Boussuge notes. “So in a way it was an opportune time to help clients focus on business continuity and digitising data.”</p>
<p>The EMEA rollout was completed last year and the bank’s focus is now on North America. “We’ve already started the phased rollout for clients and teammates, generating interest and excitement across the board,” says Boussuge.</p>
<p>All clients in the US and Canada are set to be added by the end of 2021. As such, in the coming months Bank of America will focus on launching the changes and the new skill. Looking further ahead, Latin America and Asia Pacific clients will benefit as well.</p>
<p>As outlined in a previous Treasury Today article, authority management is only the most recent of a series of skills being released in CashPro Assistant. Service dashboard, the skill that provides actionable request monitoring, and document centre, for sharing and eSigning documents, were released in CashPro Assistant previously.</p>


<h2 class="h3 copy__heading">Anatomy of a digitisation initiative</h2>
<p>Bank of America’s initiative to digitise the signature card process will include the following five stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Gain control of signatory data and entering it into a database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make data visible to clients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give clients the ability to request changes to the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expand the database to include other types of authority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide clients with full control over the data on the database.</p>
</li>
</ol>


<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<h3 id="client-experience">Client experience</h3>
<p>As authority management rollout continues, treasurers are seeing benefits of the new tool. Clients who use the tool are reporting satisfaction due to being able to produce reports in minutes instead of weeks, and submitting requests online in-tool. The client experience is also optimised in the process. “The game changer,” says Boussuge, “is that clients now have the time-saving option to submit requests very quickly online instead of picking up the phone or typing an email.”</p>
<p>“The benefit of this new digital, online option is that any required documentation can be exchanged via the online portal, which is a secure authenticated channel,” she adds.</p>
<p>With the rollout in EMEA now complete, Boussuge says that feedback from clients has been very positive. “They love the entire concept and digital focus,” she says. “They love the idea of having control, transparency and being able to overcome the challenges of antiquated, manual signer management. We have a continuous stream of clients already requesting the service.”</p>
<p>Haddad agrees, citing the example of a large retail chain that has high staff turnover, and consequently makes frequent updates. “They were very excited about the idea of no longer needing to complete signature cards manually, that they can do so in a digital way through CashPro Assistant and with eSigning,” she says. “Seeing and hearing how our services solve real-world problems is valuable feedback. It’s the reward we get when we use innovation to help our clients.”</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Managing and accessing authorised signer information is a well-known challenge for treasury teams – and in today’s landscape, treasurers are placing more value than ever on solutions that reimagine outdated processes, increase efficiency and digitise data. With the rollout now under way in North America, CashPro Assistant authority management offers treasurers a new way of managing signers and authorisations.</p>

<p>“Simple, secure, digital signer management is revolutionary for clients – and the bank,” says Jennifer Boussuge, Global Head of Treasury Fulfilment Service Operations within Global Technology &amp; Operations at Bank of America. “Traditionally across the industry, the whole process is very difficult, very manual and very paper-based. It’s been that way for a long time, but we’ve created the solution.”</p>
<p>When companies open an account, they must inform banks who their authorised signers are for actions such as signing documents and cheques.

<p>“The next step is to make the data visible to our clients,” says Haddad. “Through CashPro Assistant, a client can now view their authority profiles we have on file, allowing them to essentially pull a report on all their signers with the click of a button, saving everyone days or possibly weeks.” She adds that when clients want to make a change, they are able to submit simple, digital requests to make changes to their data.</p>
<p>Looking further ahead, Bank of America plans to extend the concept beyond the parameters of signature cards to include other types of authority – such as the authority to submit phone wires, or the named contacts for failed payment files. Finally, the project will see clients being given full control over their data, with the ability to manage their own authority information in real-time and without the need for paper signature card documents to effect changes.</p>
<h4 id="progress-so-far">Progress so far</h4>
<p>Bank of America first released CashPro Assistant authority management in March 2020. The EMEA rollout was completed last year and the bank’s focus is now on North America, with all clients in the US and Canada set to be added by the end of 2021. As such, in the coming months Bank of America will focus on launching the changes and the new skill. Looking further ahead, Latin America and Asia Pacific clients will benefit as well.</p>
<p>Boussuge says that feedback from clients has been very positive. “They love the entire concept and digital focus,” she says. “The transparency, control and ability to overcome challenges of manual signer management is revolutionary.””</p>
<p>Haddad agrees, citing the example of a large retail chain that has high staff turnover, and consequently makes frequent updates. “They were very excited about the idea no longer needing to complete signature cards manually, that they can do so in a digital way through CashPro Assistant and with eSigning,” she says. “Seeing and hearing how our services solve real-world problems is valuable feedback. It’s the reward we get when we use innovation to help our clients.”</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Tradition has it that the bank onboarding process for corporate clients is manual and slow; managing documentation for AML and KYC takes time and it’s a common pain-point that treasurers endure out of necessity. But Bank of America is transforming that experience into one that is secure, transparent and fast.</p>
<p>New desk-top service dashboard and authority management tools are now being rolled out through CashPro Assistant, itself part of the CashPro digital banking platform for cash management, credit, foreign exchange and trade services. These significant developments will revolutionise the client experience, dramatically simplifying the working lives of the approximately 500,000 users who access CashPro for their daily treasury needs.</p>
<p>Throughout the development process, the emphasis has been on end-to-end automation, with speed, simplicity and transparency as the goals. The results represent a full front and back office overhaul, taking out all manual keying and hand-offs for clients and bank employees alike.</p>
<h4 id="redefining-the-onboarding-and-service-experience">Redefining the onboarding and service experience</h4>
<p>The new service dashboard within CashPro allows clients to quickly open and clearly view all implementation and service requests. But this is not just a visual tool; it is one designed for action, with workflows and status alerts to drive progress. It is also the nerve-centre of client/bank communications throughout the entire process.</p>
<h4>CashPro Assistant in action</h4>
<p><a href="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/treasury-practice/tools/2020-03-09-tt-00-sf__bofa__screenshot__1534x920.png?la=en&amp;hash=7C0F55A93F0276E1EAC485339AE16DC2"><img alt="Screenshot of Bank of America's service dashboard – CashPro Assistant in action" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/treasury-practice/tools/2020-03-09-tt-00-sf__bofa__screenshot__1534x920.png?la=en&amp;hash=7C0F55A93F0276E1EAC485339AE16DC2" style="border:1px solid #f1f4f8;" width="967"/></a></p>
<p>It is now possible, in just one place, to see all the actions needed on every aspect of documentation, to respond to and manage those requirements, and electronically sign them, even on the CashPro mobile app. With “status view”, clients can see the level of progress made for each action and expedite proceedings wherever needed.</p>
<p>In displaying all request details in one place, the dashboard reveals to every individual (or function with appropriate access rights) the full request scope, the necessary contacts, the required documentation and the process status of each request. All actions can be done at any time the client chooses, not just bank opening hours.</p>
<p>Adding transparency to documentation processing also enhances security, since users have visibility into the precise status of every request at any given moment. Such control is especially beneficial to clients with sophisticated treasury requirements across multiple regions.</p>
<p>Where something as simple as account number reservation typically required various manual processes and a mix of emails, phone calls and spreadsheets, the new CashPro Assistant tools defy tradition. Service teams no longer have to personally call branches to request information. Thanks to secure digital automation, instead of days, account opening can take hours or even minutes to complete.</p>
<p>For any action, the moment a client’s request is entered into the system, an automated search is made for relevant documentation already held by the bank. This search is executed across the bank’s interconnected data store. This means repeat presentation of current documents for KYC for example, are a thing of the past for clients.</p>
<h4 id="consolidated-digitized-authorisation">Consolidated digitised authorisation</h4>
<p>The adoption of a holistic profile of client activities within CashPro Assistant means managing authorisations for CashPro users has been turned on its head. The traditional way of thinking of authorisations, by account and by entity, saw information stored on different databases and often on unrelated spreadsheets.</p>
<p>The employment of a new treasurer, for example, required contact with each banking provider and in some instances different contacts across geographies, often necessitating different documentation and disparate messaging for each. Every change demanded a repeat performance. At no point was any of this offered as a consolidated view, making authorisation control a real challenge.</p>
<p>The new way places the individual at the centre of the process. By viewing an employee’s profile across all entities and accounts, the client is given control to manage all authorities in one place. They can do this at any time, allowing reports to be easily created on individual or all authorisations, and to take action as required. With audit trails and workflow capability, CashPro Assistant can, for example, manage escalation of action to the required level of authorisation, and even provide specific bank personnel contact details for direct issue management.</p>
<h4 id="roll-out">Roll-out</h4>
<p>Whether on-boarding or managing account authorisations, the new CashPro Assistant now promises a fast, simple, secure and transparent experience for users when exchanging documents and communicating with the bank.</p>
<p>Full platform pilot is underway with a group of clients in Europe and will be available for all Europe accounts this summer. The authority management tool will be added for Europe and the United States accounts by end of year. Other regions will be phased in over time.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is a method used to calculate the average cost of capital to a company, weighted according to the proportion of equity, debt and other types of capital. This cost of capital represents the discount rate that should be used for capital budgeting calculations to determine whether a given project or activity generates a sufficient expected return to compensate for its risks.</p>
<p>A company producing a return of 20% with a WACC of 11% is creating ₹0.09 of value for every Indian rupee of capital. On the other hand, a company returning less than its WACC is destroying value – even if it is profitable. WACC is also used as the discount rate applied to future cash flows for deriving a business’s net present value. All else being equal, the WACC of a firm increases as the beta and rate of return on equity increases, as an increase in WACC notes a decrease in valuation and a higher risk. The WACC equation is the cost of each capital component multiplied by its proportional weight and then summing:</p>

<h3 id="calculating-wacc">Calculating WACC</h3>
<p>So, if a company has an enterprise value that was weighted 2:1 in favour of equity and cost of debt was 4%, then WACC would be 8%, the weighted average of 4% and 10% on a one-third: two-thirds basis. This means though that to calculate WACC, investors need to determine the company’s cost of equity and cost of debt. Calculating the latter is straightforward; calculating the former is not and this gives rise to significant variations in the WACC for companies when calculated by different analysts.</p>
<h3 id="cost-of-equity">Cost of equity</h3>
<p>The cost of equity is the equity holders’ required rate of return. This is not immediately observable and must be derived from those market variables that can be observed. The capital asset pricing model is the most commonly accepted method for calculating cost of equity. This expresses the cost of equity as the opportunity cost of investing in the equity, taking account of the risks involved. It adds the risk free rate of return that investors are giving up and which they could earn simply by buying medium-term government bonds, to the overall market equity risk premium plus an adjustment for the riskiness of this particular company’s shares.</p>
<h3 id="cost-of-debt">Cost of debt</h3>
<p>If a company raised all of its capital from debt then the cost of that capital would be relatively straightforward to calculate. It would essentially be the rate of interest paid by the company on bank loans, overdrafts and bonds. The rate applied to determine the cost of debt (Rd) should be the current market rate the company is paying on its debt. If the company is not paying market rates, an appropriate market rate payable by the company should be estimated. As companies benefit from the tax deductions available on interest paid, the net cost of the debt is actually the interest paid less the tax savings resulting from the tax-deductible interest payment. Therefore, the after-tax cost of debt is Rd (1 – corporate tax rate).</p>

<p>EV is a useful metric to use when discussing a company’s valuation because it represents the real value of a business. For example, if a business is sold for a sum of ¥100 billion, but had debts totalling ¥100 billion, then the EV would be zero. By dividing a company’s EV by its EBITDA, we can calculate the EVM, taking into account the business’s value, including stock price and debt levels, and relates that value to its cash profitability.</p>

<h3 id="using-evm">Using EVM</h3>
<p>The EVM is popular with investors as, unlike other calculations such as the P/E ratio, it is unaffected by differences in depreciation policy or changes in capital structure. Lower earnings per share, and hence a higher P/E ratio, would result if a company chose to raise equity finance and used the funds to repay loans. But the EVM would not be affected by this change in capital structure, and using it means it is possible to draw comparisons between companies with different capital structures.</p>
<p>A second benefit of the EVM is that it eliminates the effects of all the non-cash expenses, such as depreciation and amortisation, and focuses instead upon the thing which investors are really interested in: cash flow.</p>
<h3>Limitations and caveats</h3>
<p>One significant limitation of the EVM is that it should only be used with caution when comparing businesses across the same industry. Capital requirements can vary considerably between industries, and whether an industry is characterised by high or low growth will often determine the EVM. Several other limitations can also be identified:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>EVM is useful for comparing companies that have a similar level of capital intensity. Higher capital intensity results in a lower EVM which could mislead investors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EVM cannot be used when cash flow is negative – typically, a normalised EBITDA or a forward multiple are used instead.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When using the EVM it is important to ensure that EV and EBITDA are calculated for the same business. If a company has part-owned subsidiaries, for example, one must ensure that only the proportion of EBITDA in a subsidiary owned by the company in question is included in the calculation. Alternatively, adjusting the enterprise value multiple to include the shares not owned by the company will give the EVM for the whole group. Finally, the EVM should not be applied as a standalone measure. Prudent companies and investors will always look to achieve the most comprehensive analysis possible by using the measure along with a wide variety of other statistics.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Operating margin, sometimes referred to as operating profit margin, is used for measuring a business’s pricing strategy and operating efficiency. It should not be confused with net profit margin, as it does not take into account cash expenses, such as interest payments or tax, for example. Instead, operating margin is the proportion of a company’s revenue that remains after the costs associated with operating the business have been deducted. These include payments such as wages, raw materials, etc. A good operating margin is required to cover other costs, such as interest payments on company debt.</p>
<p>Operating margin provides a measure of profit (before interest and taxes) on each dollar of revenue. For example, if a company has an operating margin of 16%, it makes a profit of $0.16 for every dollar of sales.</p>
<h3 id="how-is-it-calculated">How is it calculated?</h3>
<p>Operating profit margin is expressed as a percentage of total revenue. It is calculated as follows:</p>

<p>The calculation can give an indication of the effectiveness of a company’s pricing strategy, particularly when measured over a period of time, or in comparison to competitors. For the operating margin to improve, there must be an increase in the difference between the price at which goods are sold and the operating cost. This increase in difference may be due to factors such as improved competitiveness in the company’s pricing strategy, improved operational efficiency and lower cost of raw materials.</p>
<h3 id="points-to-consider">Points to consider</h3>
<p>Generally, the higher a company’s profit margin, the better the return it will be able to provide its shareholders. Operating margin can be a useful way to determine the potential a company has to improve its profits by expanding its margins. Conversely, operating margin can provide an indication of how much profits may be threatened by price competition. It should be noted, however, that the excessive expanding of margins, particularly if this is achieved through price increases to the consumer, may dent profits by damaging the company’s competitiveness.</p>
<p>As with most financial metrics, operating margin is best compared in conjunction with other financial ratios and measures. It is also best to stick to comparisons between companies within certain industry sectors as benchmark margins may vary between different industries.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Jensen’s measure or Jensen’s alpha, developed by Michael Jensen in 1968, is used to calculate the return on a portfolio in excess of its theoretical expected return. The theoretical expected return is based on a market model, usually the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). The CAPM provides a model for the risk-adjusted return on an investment. Any investment that performs better than its projected risk-adjusted return is said to have a positive alpha. Alpha is a measure of return over and above that explained by the securities market line and the investment’s beta (volatility).</p>
<p>Jensen’s measure is used to evaluate investment managers’ performance, since a positive measure of alpha shows that the portfolio has outperformed the benchmark.</p>
<h3 id="how-is-it-calculated">How is it calculated?</h3>
<p>Jensen’s measure is a measure of alpha (a). It takes into account the excess return on the portfolio in relation to its beta and the return on the market as a whole.</p>

<p>The investment portfolio manager achieved alpha of 0.1, meaning that the portfolio outperformed the market by 10%.</p>
<h3 id="efficient-market-hypothesis">Efficient market hypothesis</h3>
<p>Investment managers are constantly striving for alpha. When developing his measure, however, Jensen discovered in his research that no funds really ever did achieve alpha. The few that did, he attributed to random chance. In fact, Jensen’s findings strongly correlated with the efficient market hypothesis.</p>
<p>The efficient market hypothesis was developed by Eugene Fama as a model for market performance. If the prices in a market reflect all available information, that market is said to be ‘efficient’. This means that any external information investors may consider when making investment decisions has already been considered in the pricing of stocks. This effectively negates speculative trading and suggests that an actively managed portfolio may perform no better than a passively managed, or index, fund.</p>
<p>Jensen’s measure is an important tool for treasurers who want to achieve the best possible return on any investment, whether that means achieving alpha or not. Jensen’s measure may be used, in association with other metrics, to make predictions on the potential of a particular investment to outperform another, thus assisting treasurers in their investment decisions.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Market capitalisation]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Market capitalisation is used by investors to classify companies as large, mid or small-cap. The terms micro and nano-cap are also sometimes applied. These categories are frequently used as investment criteria, particularly when trying to maintain diversification in a portfolio of assets. As with most investor ratios, market cap is often used in conjunction with other measures – such as book value – to help analyse a company’s overall value to the shareholder.</p>
<h3 id="how-is-it-calculated">How is it calculated?</h3>
<p>The following formula is used to calculate market capitalisation:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mtext>Market capitalisation</mtext>
<mo>=</mo>
<mtext>price per share</mtext>
<mo>x</mo>
<mtext>number of shares outstanding or issued</mtext>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>The price per share of a company and the number of outstanding shares can usually be found either from newspapers or the internet. The audited accounts will always give the outstanding or issued share capital. A company’s market cap should always be quoted in the currency unit in which the shares are priced.</p>
<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p>Company ABC’s shares are quoted at ¥12.46 each. The company has 3,500,000 shares outstanding. Using the above formula, the company’s market capitalisation is ¥12,110,000 
<math>
<mfenced>
<mrow>
<mo>¥</mo>
<mn>3.46</mn>
<mo>x</mo>
<mn>3,500,000</mn>
</mrow>
</mfenced>
</math>, which according to the classifications below would make it a small-cap company.</p>
<h3 id="classifications">Classifications</h3>
<p>The classifications for market capitalisation are not precise or fixed and may vary between different exchanges. The classification of shares into large, mid and small-cap is made on the basis of the relative size of that particular stock exchange. For example, a mid-cap stock in the US would be classified as a large-cap company in India. The classifications also vary over time – so what was classified as large-cap in 1960 is almost certainly going to be different in 2013.</p>
<h3 id="free-float-market-capitalisation">Free-float market capitalisation</h3>
<p>The above method for calculating market capitalisation is referred to as the full market capitalisation. In reality however, not all of the outstanding shares are freely available to be traded – they may be ‘locked’ in a government or strategic holding for example. This information can usually be obtained from the company itself or the exchange. There may also be more than one class of share.</p>
<p>Free-float market capitalisation is calculated by multiplying the full market cap by what is known as the free-float factor. This is determined by dividing the number of shares readily available for trading in the market by the total number of shares outstanding and rounding it up or down to the nearest 0.05 increment.</p>
<p>If we continue with the example of company ABC and if, out of the 3,500,000 shares outstanding, 2,875,000 are readily available to trade, the company’s free-float factor can be calculated as follows:</p>
<p>

<mn>3,500,000</mn>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mfenced>
<mo>=</mo>
<mn>0.821</mn>
</mrow>
</math>, which is then rounded down to 0.80.</p>
<p>This means that the company’s free-float market capitalisation is 
<math>
<mrow>

<mn>2,110,000</mn>
<mo>x</mo>
<mn>0.8</mn>
<mo>=</mo>
<mo>$</mo>
<mn>9,688,000</mn>
</mrow>
</math>.</p>
<h3 id="considerations">Considerations</h3>
<p>Market capitalisation is not the only measure to evaluate a company’s financial value. A common weakness in this calculation is that it takes into account the sum total of equity. Debt holders have a claim on the company and this should be taken into consideration. Market capitalisation calculation is hence often used together with other formulas, such as enterprise value and valuation ratios. Market capitalisation can also be useful for valuation and any valuation ratio using share prices can also be restated in terms of market capitalisation.</p>
<h3 id="other-uses">Other uses</h3>
<p>The market capitalisation formula is not used exclusively for calculating the market value of a company’s shares – it can also be used to determine the market value of an industry, a stock exchange or even an entire country.</p>

<h3 id="calculating-net-profit-margin">Calculating net profit margin</h3>
<p>Net profit margin is calculated by taking after-tax net profit and dividing by net sales. The formula set out below is the one typically used in most finance textbooks.</p>

<p>In the above example, company ABC averaged a profit margin of 10.44% over the past two financial years, which is the equivalent of saying that for every yen of net sales in that period the company generated a net profit of ¥0.140. As the figures show, the company made more profit per yen of expenses in 2012 than it did in 2011. This fluctuation could potentially be explained with reference to a range of active factors: for example procurement costs, increased prices for the company’s products or services, and efficiency improvements. Alternatively, the changes could be the result of market-based factors, such as falling commodity prices.</p>
<p>Profit margins inevitably vary by industry. However, when two companies are competing in the same sector against one another the sum can be particularly useful to determine which company is performing best and, therefore, represents a better investment opportunity. Let us suppose that both of the companies in the above example are software developers based in Japan. Over the period 2011-12, company XYZ averaged a net profit margin of 8.89% compared to company ABC’s 10.44%. So despite generating less sales revenue during the two-year period than company XYZ, company ABC may, according to the net profit ratio, represent a higher quality investment.</p>
<p>The above comparison, however, could provide a misleading benchmark if it is not compared to the industry average. For example, if the industry average for a Japanese software developer is an 18%, net profit margin, then it would seem that neither company has performed as well as their industry competitors over the two-year period.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Companies use the asset coverage ratio to measure their ability to cover their debt.  When a company has a high ratio this indicates that the company is likely to be able to keep operating with current debt and asset levels, whereas a low ratio – for example see below – makes this less likely.</p>

<p>The asset coverage ratios of companies in different industries cannot always be compared because typical debt and asset levels vary between industries.  A ratio considered safe for a utilities company, for example, may not be viewed so positively for, say, investment firms.  As a rule of thumb, utilities should have an asset coverage ratio of at least 1.5, and industrial companies should have a ratio of at least two.</p>
<p>As companies UVW and XYZ are operating in the same industry, their asset coverage ratios can be compared.  Company UVW is clearly in a better position than company XYZ, with higher debt-to-asset levels, and there is a higher risk that company XYZ will be unable to fulfil its obligations to creditors.</p>
<h3 id="points-to-consider">Points to consider</h3>
<p>This calculation includes tangible assets only – therefore the asset coverage ratio given is likely to be an underestimate, rather than an overestimate.  Although intangible assets have value, it is difficult to measure these accurately and could therefore result in an overly optimistic representation of the firm’s health.</p>
<p>It is important, likewise, to account for depreciation of assets.  If assets are sold, their current value is realised, rather than their original cost – their ‘book value’.  As a result, if their book value is used in the calculation a falsely high ratio will be obtained.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the ratio should be compared with other companies in the same industry if a meaningful comparison is to be drawn.</p>
<p>In any case, the ratio only gives one indication of a company’s health.  In order to have a clearer picture of a company’s financial strengths and weaknesses it should be used in conjunction with other financial ratios.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><i>The cash conversion cycle (CCC) is the length of time, averaged in terms of days, which it takes for a company to convert expenditure on raw materials and other production costs into receipts of cash through the sale of its goods and services.  It offers an indication of a business’s operational efficiency and liquidity.</i></p>
<p>A fundamental measurement of working capital management, the cash conversion cycle can vary across companies and industries.  It is a popular indicator, used widely in corporate finance and investment analysis, which shows how long it takes a firm to convert production activities (requiring cash) back into cash.</p>
<p>The shorter a company’s CCC, the less cash is tied up in working capital.  This also means the company will be less reliant on external funding.  A positive value for the CCC indicates the company is perhaps borrowing while it awaits payment.  Companies ideally aim for a low or even negative CCC.  The latter situation arises when the company receives cash receipts before it is due to make any payments.  Amazon is one company that operates a negative CCC.</p>
<h3 id="formula">Formula</h3>
<p>A function of three distinct variables, CCC can be calculated as follows:</p>

</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO), also known as the average ‘stockholding period’, is the length of time it takes for a company to convert cash spent on production to cash receipts garnered at the point of sale.  It in effect tells the company how often its stock turns over in a given amount of time.  But it varies across industries.</p>
<p>Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) measures how long it takes, on average, for a company to collect revenue after a sale is made.  The quicker receivables are collected, the sooner the company can set about reinvesting cash into the business.  A lower DSO, therefore, would imply less reliance on external funding, and places the company in a comfortable working capital position.  A high DSO usually implies that goods are sold on extended credit.  In this sense, the value of the DSO will be dependent on forces beyond the company’s control (ie, the conduct of customers).</p>
<p>Finally, Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) is the number of days a company has before it has to make payments to creditors.  The higher DPO is, the longer the company has to accumulate cash receipts before repaying its financial obligations.  Taking these three variables into account, the CCC can also be written as:</p>

<h3 id="points-to-consider">Points to consider</h3>
<p>The CCC measures the length of time from the outlay of cash for stock to the recovery of cash after the sale.  But it is important to note that the CCC is also a dynamic measurement.  It incorporates the condition of time.  It can therefore offer a better indication of a company’s liquidity than, say, the current ratio, which is a static measurement.</p>
<p>Also, the CCC should be viewed in the context of a trend.  When it grows in size, it represents a negative development for the business (for example, cash becomes tied up in production for longer).  On the other hand, when the CCC is reduced, it suggests that the business may be managing its liquidity more effectively.  Academic studies have suggested that, the larger the company, the more likely it will have a shorter CCC.  In addition, it has been found there is a statistically significant negative correlation between CCC and profitability.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Regression analysis, sometimes referred to simply as ‘regression’, is a statistical tool used to analyse the relationship between two or more variables. It is employed in many areas of forecasting and financial analysis because it can help analysts understand how strongly a set of ‘independent’, that is to say changing, variables are related to a ‘dependent’ one.</p>
<p>Unlike correlation, which looks at the interdependence of variables, regression works on the assumption that the independent variable(s) has a one-way causal effect on the dependent variable. Take for example the write-downs banks faced during the financial crisis in relation to the number of sub-prime mortgages they had on their books: in general, one would assume that the more sub-prime loans they made, the greater the number of write-downs they faced.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-regression">Types of regression</h3>
<p>There are two basic types of regression: linear and multiple. Regression analysis that deals with just one independent variable (usually denoted by 
<math>
<mrow>
<mi>X</mi>
</mrow>
</math>) and one dependent variable (usually denoted by 
<math>
<mrow>
<mi>Y</mi>
</mrow>
</math>) is termed linear regression. In its simplest form, a linear regression describes an unchanging relationship between the two variables. As such, values of the two variables (determined from an existing data set) are used to develop a model, the aim of which is to predict the value of 
<math>
<mrow>
<mi>Y</mi>
</mrow>
</math> for given values of 
<math>
<mrow>
<mi>X</mi>
</mrow>
</math>.</p>
<p>Multiple regression works on a similar premise, but uses two or more independent variables. Each independent variable is denoted by using subscripted numbers, such as 
<math>
<mrow>
<mi>X</mi>
<mn><sub>1</sub></mn>
</mrow>
</math>, 
<math>
<mrow>
<mi>X</mi>
<mn><sub>2</sub></mn>
</mrow>
</math> and so on. Again, the aim is to build a model that can forecast the value of 
<math>
<mrow>
<mi>Y</mi>
</mrow>
</math>.</p>
<h3 id="methodology-for-simple-linear-regression">Methodology for simple linear regression</h3>
<p>It is useful to examine the data graphically before the regression analysis really begins. The first step is to plot a scatter graph using the values of the variables. The analysis can start once a ‘line of best fit’ has been introduced. This provides a ‘summary’ of the points and draws out the relationship between the variables more explicitly.</p>

<p><math>
<mrow>
<mi>a</mi>
</mrow>
</math> is the variable that represents the point at which the line of best fit intercepts the y-axis.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all data points will lie directly on this line of best fit – other factors tend to influence the dependent variable. The distance between a data point and the line of best fit is termed the ‘regression residual’. This is sometimes factored into the regression equation as ‘
<math>
<mrow>
<mi>c</mi>

</math>’, such that

<h3 id="practical-application">Practical application</h3>
<p>Regression calculations could be used in the treasury function to determine the extent to which specific variable factors, such as interest rates or the price of a commodity, influence movements in the price of an asset. In receivables management, for example, the impact of early-payment discounts offered to customers might also lend itself to regression analysis.</p>

<p>The net present value (NPV) of an asset is the sum total of the present values (PV) of that asset over a given period of time. It is used in the field of discounted cash flow analysis and allows an investor to calculate the likely returns on a prospective investment over its lifetime.</p>
<p>The NPV calculation is relatively straightforward. For each year of the investment, the net cash flow of the investment is divided by the discount rate to the power of the year of the investment.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Options: the Greeks]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>

<p>Corporate Treasurers notoriously dislike the use of options. They don’t like paying premium upfront; they don’t like managing the accounting issues and they don’t like the complexity of option valuation. To understand option prices you need to know a little bit of Greek.</p>
<h3 id="delta">Delta</h3>
<p>Occasionally referred to as the hedge ratio, the delta of an option is a measure of the effect a change in the price of an underlying asset has on the price of a put or call option taken out on that asset. It is used to ascertain the rate at which the price of a derivative will change as the price of the underlying asset fluctuates.</p>
<p>The delta is conventionally assigned a decimal figure between one and minus one to indicate the percentage move in the option price for a one unit move in the underlying, but traders generally use the percentage itself. Whereas changes in vanilla call option prices are indicated by positive deltas, vanilla put option deltas are assigned negative values.</p>
<h3 id="call-options">Call options</h3>
<p>To take an example, a vanilla call option with a delta of 0.6 (or 60) means that for every €1 increase in the price of an underlying asset, the price of the call option will increase commensurately by €0.60. Conversely, when the price of the underlying stock decreases the value of the call option also decreases by the amount of the derivative’s delta.</p>
<figure class="center">

</figure>
<h3 id="put-options">Put options</h3>
<p>The deltas for vanilla put options are negative values because as the underlying security increases in price, the price of the option decreases. For example, a delta of -0.6 for a put option means that the derivate decreases in price by €0.60 for every €1 the underlying asset rises in value.</p>
<p>Like call options, put derivatives respond to changes in price of the underlying stock price and their deltas respond to these changes.</p>
<p>For example, when the price of the underlying stock increases, the price of the put option decreases by its delta value. Conversely, when the underlying stock falls in price, the price of the put option moves in the opposite direction by the size of its delta.</p>
<figure class="center">

<p>If a call option is described as in-the-money (ITM), its delta is above 0.5 and the underlying stock is trading above the strike price of the option. Conversely, an option that is out-of-the-money (OTM) means that the derivative has a delta of less than 0.5 and the strike price of the option is above the price at which the underlying stock is currently trading.</p>

</figure>
<p>A call option trading at-the-money (ATM) will have a delta of 0.5 or somewhere close to that figure. The strike price of the option and the price of the underlying asset are equal or are nearing the same price.</p>
<p>When a call option’s strike price is far below the market price of the underlying asset, the option is referred to as deep-in-the-money and its delta approaches one. This means that the price moves of the option match those of the underlying asset. At the other end of the scale, far out-of-the-money options have small deltas.</p>
<h3 id="hedge-ratio">Hedge ratio</h3>
<p>Since option delta is a measure of how sensitive an option’s price is to changes in the underlying, it is useful as a hedge ratio. A futures option with a delta of 0.5 means that the option price increases 0.5 for every one point increase in the futures price. For small changes in the futures price therefore, the option behaves like one-half of a futures contract.</p>
<p>Constructing a delta hedge for a long position in ten calls, each with a delta of 0.5 would require you to sell five futures contracts. (The delta of a futures contract is always one.)</p>
<h3 id="gamma">Gamma</h3>
<p>An option’s gamma is used to gauge the sensitivity of delta to changes in the underlying stock. It measures the responsiveness of the derivative’s delta to a one-point shift in the underlying asset. When the option is nearing its strike price, the gamma will be larger than it is for out-of-the-money deltas. Unlike delta, gamma is positive for both call and put options.</p>
<h3 id="theta">Theta</h3>
<p>An option’s theta is a measure of how much value the option loses every day before it reaches maturity. The more time there is for the underlying to hit the strike price of an option, the more valuable, all other things being equal, the option is. And clearly at expiration the time-value of any option is zero. So options are always losing part of the time-value component of their overall value, which is why theta values are always negative and the theta of an option that is further away from its date of expiration is always smaller than that of one which is close to maturation.</p>

<p>EBITDA stands for Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation.  It is a measure of a company’s profitability and shows how much money the company has made before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation have been deducted.</p>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Operating income (or Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT)) = net income + interest + taxes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depreciation is a non-cash expense which is used to account for a tangible asset’s reduction in value over time by deducting capital expenses during the period in which the asset is used.  This is sometimes described as ‘writing off’ the asset over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amortisation is like depreciation but refers to intangible assets, such as the goodwill that may arise when a company is acquired for more than the value of its net assets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="uses">Uses</h3>
<p>The EBITDA measure gained popularity in the 1980s as a means of determining how profitable leveraged buyouts might be as it gives an indication of the company’s ability to service debt.</p>
<p>EBITDA is seen as a measure that enables comparisons between companies that have different capital structures, as it ignores interest charges.  By excluding taxes, it also makes it possible to compare companies in different countries which may be subject to different tax regimes.  It is often used in loan covenants.</p>
<p>EBITDA is also sometimes viewed as a measure of cash flow because non-cash expenses are added back.  However, the key difference is that operating cash flow takes into account working capital fluctuations (ie changes in receivables, payables and inventories on the balance sheet) whereas EBITDA does not.</p>
<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>
<p>EBITDA is widely seen as an unreliable measurement for a number of reasons.  It is not defined by GAAP and is therefore susceptible to manipulation by companies that want to make their earnings look stronger than they really are.  Different companies may define amortisation and depreciation in different ways and companies can even change the way in which EBITDA is measured in different reporting periods.  In 2002, it was discovered that fallen giant WorldCom had inflated its EBITDA to the tune of $3.8 billion by reclassifying certain operating costs as capital costs which could then be depreciated over time, thus delaying the recognition of these costs while still recognising the associated revenues.</p>
<p>Other criticisms of EBITDA include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Interest and tax may be significant costs and it is misleading to exclude them from a measurement of profitability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capital expenditure required to replace short-lived assets is not taken into account.  EBITDA is therefore more appropriate as a measurement of companies with long-lived assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fluctuations in working capital are not taken into account by EBITDA.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Consequently it is advisable to use EBITDA with caution and only in conjunction with other measurements.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>The recent regulatory focus on money market funds both in Europe and the US has turned attention back to the ways in which fund interest rate risk is measured. The two most common variables are weighted average maturity (WAM) and weighted average life (WAL).</p>
<h3 id="weighted-average-maturity-wam">Weighted Average Maturity (WAM)</h3>
<p>The traditional WAM calculation is a basic measure of a money market fund’s maturity profile. To calculate the WAM of a portfolio, each security’s percentage of the total of the portfolio is multiplied by its interest reset date and these numbers are then summed.</p>
<p>Take a $10m portfolio containing the following four bonds:</p>
<ul class="plain">
<li>
<p>$4m with a 60 day maturity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>$3m with a 28 day maturity</p>

<p>It should be noted that in the US, when calculating WAM under SEC Rule 2a-7, a fund adviser is permitted to use the interest-rate reset date, rather than a security’s stated final maturity, for variable- and floating-rate securities. By looking to a portfolio’s interest rate reset schedule in lieu of final maturity dates, the WAM measure effectively captures a fund’s exposure to interest rate movements and the potential price impact resulting from them: a longer weighted average maturity implies greater volatility in response to interest rate changes.</p>
<p>This is why the SEC has reduced the maximum WAM permissible for money market funds. A fund with a 90-day WAM can withstand an instantaneous change in interest rates of 200 basis points before breaking the buck. Breaking the buck is the phrase used to describe a fund’s inability to repay investors at par. In contrast, a fund with a WAM of 60 days can withstand an interest rate change of 300 basis points without breaking the buck. Also, a fund with a 90-day WAM facing a change in credit spreads of 50 basis points and redemptions of 10% would break the buck with an interest rate change of a little more than 100 basis points. A fund with a 60-day WAM would be in a better position to withstand multiple shocks without breaking the buck than if it maintained a 90-day or 75-day WAM.</p>
<p>However, because of its potential reliance on interest rate reset dates, WAM does not measure the risk faced by a fund required to hold its entire portfolio of securities to their final maturities. To do this, another measure is needed.</p>
<h3 id="weighted-average-life-wal">Weighted Average Life (WAL)</h3>
<p>The WAL calculation is based on a security’s stated final maturity date or, when relevant, the date of the next demand feature when the investing fund may receive payment of principal and interest. Accordingly, WAL reflects how a portfolio would react to deteriorating credit or tightening liquidity conditions.</p>
<p>So in contrast to WAM, in this calculation the time weightings are based on the final principal repayments – again, the higher the dollar amount, the more weight that corresponding time period will have.</p>
<p>The SEC has just restricted the maximum weighted average life of a fund’s portfolio to 120 days. The effect of the restriction is to limit the ability of the fund to invest in long-term floating rate securities using the WAL definition to shorten the maturity of an adjustable-rate security by reference to its interest rate reset dates. Longer-term securities are more sensitive to credit spreads than short-term securities with final maturities equal to the reset date of the longer term security. This means that they are more likely to deviate significantly from their amortised cost, so raising the possibility that the fund will break the buck in the event of market disruption.</p>
<p>Treasurers should use both WAL and WAM together in order to obtain a clear picture of the interest rate and credit spread risks run by the funds in which they invest.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Basel III in numbers]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>The regulations set out in Basel III mean that banks will have to maintain more robust capital reserves and equity buffers than they do at present. The accords, which were passed by the G20 last November, build on the principles established in Basel I and II. Treasurers now need more than a passing acquaintance with these ratios because their banks’ willingness to deal with them will be a direct function of their Basel numbers.</p>
<p>Basel I applied a simple principle to a bank’s assets: each class of asset was given a uniform risk weighting. Basel II took a more nuanced approach, but the principle remained the same. The rating applied to the asset was determined by the bank’s internal rating and by the credit rating assigned to it by an agency. Under Basel III, the minimum level of capital that a bank will have to hold against the assets on its balance sheet – the capital adequacy ratio – will depend on the risk profiles, or weightings, of those assets.</p>
<h3 id="the-capital-adequacy-ratio-car">The capital adequacy ratio (CAR)</h3>
<figure>
<math>

<mtext>CAR</mtext>

<mfenced>
<mtext>RWAs</mtext>

</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>Under Basel III, CAR will remain at 8% until 2016 rising to 10.5% by 2019. Banks will have to maintain a minimum common equity ratio of 4.5% (plus the conservation buffer of 2.5%) and a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% (8.5% including the buffer). Total capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) must be 8% (10.5% including the buffer). This is an increase on Basel II but because the CAR is a function of risk weighted assets, not total assets, it still allows banks to build up significant leverage. Even a AAA-rated CDO, catalyst for the banking crisis, under the new regime is only 20% risk weighted and so generates a capital charge of 20% of 8% – a mere 1.6%.</p>
<p>The Basel III rules lay out two other ratios: the liquidity ratio and the net stable funding ratio.</p>
<h3 id="liquidity-coverage-ratio-lcr">Liquidity coverage ratio (LCR)</h3>
<p>Should a run on the bank occur, or should the market be otherwise ‘dislocated’, the committee has established a ratio that it hopes will keep the banks afloat. The liquidity coverage ratio is used by banks to determine the amount of capital they will need “under an acute stress liquidity scenario”.</p>
<figure>

<mn> 30 </mn>
<mtext>day time period</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>High quality assets include government and covered bonds. Under Basel III, banks are required to maintain a minimum liquid coverage ratio of 100%.</p>
<h3 id="net-stable-funding-ratio-nsfr">Net stable funding ratio (NSFR)</h3>
<p>The Basel Committee hopes that the net stable funding ratio (NSFR) will make banks think longer-term. The ratio was therefore devised to allow banks to establish ‘more medium and long-term funding of the assets and activities’. It is defined as:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mtext>NSFR</mtext>
<mo>=</mo>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mtext>available amount of stable funding</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>required amount of stable funding</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>Again, banks are required to maintain a minimum NSFR of 100%.</p>
<p>The measure seeks to quantify the proportion of structural term assets which are funded by stable funding, including customer deposits, long-term wholesale funding and equity.</p>
<p>The left-hand side of the ratio represents the sources of core bank funding, that is Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital, ‘stable’ retail deposits with a maturity of less than a year, and 50% of large corporate deposits with a maturity of less than a year.</p>
<p>The right-hand side of the equation is calculated as the weighted sum of the assets that sit on a bank’s balance sheet. They include cash (risk weighted 0%), liquid securities (5%), corporate bonds (20%), other corporate bonds (50%) and retail loans with a maturity of less than a year (80%).</p>
<p>This ratio is of particular interest to the corporate treasurer as according to one analyst’s calculations, it adds €1.1 trillion to the European banking sector’s funding requirements, with the consequent impact on the corporate market.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[The forward outright rate]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>

<p>A forward outright is a means of hedging against currency movements by locking in an exchange rate for an FX transaction on a future date. This article outlines how to calculate the forward outright rate.</p>
<p>‘Spot’ transactions on the foreign exchange market are generally settled two working days after the trade is agreed (though there are a few exceptions, including USD/Canadian dollar, USD/Turkish lira, USD/Philippine peso and USD/Russian rouble, which can be settled in one working day).</p>
<p>It is also possible to agree that the trade of one currency for another will be settled at any set date in the future. This arrangement is referred to as a ‘forward contract’. It is important to note that the forward rate is entirely unrelated to any futures market. In a currency futures market, prices are specified at which currencies can be traded at a future date.</p>
<p>The ‘forward outright rate’ is based on the spot rate at the time the transaction is agreed. However, because time elapses between the agreement and the actual transfer of currencies, the interest rates of both currencies are also taken into account whilst calculating the forward exchange rate.</p>
<p>By convention, when currency pairs (eg EUR/GBP) are quoted, the first named currency is known as the ‘base’ currency in the transaction, and the second is the ‘variable’ currency. For example, when a corporate is selling euro, that ‘base’ level is fixed, when the currency being bought (eg GBP) is ‘variable’, changing over time relative to the euro.</p>

</math>
</figure>
<p>Note: By further convention, for the purposes of foreign exchange calculations most countries count 360 days in the year.</p>
<p>To give a worked example, assume a France-based treasurer needs GBP in one month’s time. The treasurer could buy GBP at the spot rate, and deposit the money for a month to gain interest before the GBP is actually needed. However, by using the forward outright rate the treasurer ‘locks in’ the spot exchange rate and keeps the euros for another month before exchanging them at the time GBP is needed.</p>
<p>Assume that the interest rate in the UK is 0.9% and in the Eurozone is 0.7%, and that the current spot rate is 0.8522. EUR, as the first quoted currency, is the base currency and GBP is the variable currency. This means €1 currently buys £0.8522.</p>
<p>In this case:</p>
<figure>
<math>

<mo>=</mo>
<mn>0.8532</mn>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>Note that the value of the currency with the lower interest rate appreciates relative to the other currency in the transaction.</p>
<p>As an example, assume a EUR/GBP exchange rate of 0.75. Spot €100 is worth £75. If the EUR interest rate is 10% and the GBP interest rate is 5%, in one year’s time the original €100 will be worth €110 and the £75 will be worth £78.75 – a relative forward exchange rate of 0.72. That means each euro buys 0.03 fewer GBP, and so sterling has appreciated.</p>

<p>The solvency ratio is used to measure a company’s ability to meet its long-term debt obligations.

<p>The above examples illustrate the importance of limiting comparison of solvency ratios to single industries. However, while ratios vary from industry to industry they do provide a quick way of measuring approximately how much cash is being generated to service the company’s debt.</p>
<p>Companies ABC and DEF are both technology companies and therefore their solvency ratios are suitably comparable. Company DEF is more likely to default on its debts than Company ABC, but its relatively good solvency ratio indicates that it is still a fairly healthy company.</p>
<p>Airlines, however, operate with much higher debt than technology companies, and therefore tend to display low, or even negative, solvency ratios.</p>
<h3 id="points-to-consider">Points to consider</h3>
<p>As with all financial debt and profitability ratios, solvency ratios should not be used in isolation, but in conjunction with other metrics. As mentioned above, it is also important to compare solvency ratios against the benchmark for the relevant industry. Treasurers need to be aware of all the factors which may affect a company’s solvency ratio and remember that an airline with a negative ratio, for example, may prove to be a more prudent investment than a technology company with a ratio of 10%.</p>
<p>Note that the solvency ratio used when analysing insurance companies is a totally different measure, which attempts to assess the adequacy of the insurance company’s reserves.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Contribution margin is a measure of profitability that evaluates the percentage of sales revenue remaining after variable costs have been deducted. Variable costs should include the cost of raw materials or shipping, for example. These are as opposed to fixed costs, such as rent or salaries. The contribution margin may also be used to determine the profit margin of each unit of a particular product or service.</p>

<p>These figures show that both Product A and Product B have contribution margins that exceed the contribution margin of Company XYZ as a whole. This might suggest that the company’s smaller product lines are dragging down the company’s overall performance. Product B’s contribution margin is greater than that of Product A, illustrating that the variable costs of producing Product B are proportionately lower. In addition, Product B may have a greater margin priced into it when it is sold on to the consumer.</p>
<h3 id="points-to-consider">Points to consider</h3>
<p>Contribution margin may be used to identify products that are underperforming. If a product’s contribution margin is falling short of the company’s contribution margin, it may be worth investigating whether the fixed costs of producing the product can be reduced, whether the product’s sale price could be increased or whether the product should be removed from production altogether.</p>
<p>Contribution margin is sometimes confused with gross product margin. They are not the same, however, since gross product margin only takes into account the cost of sales (or cost of goods sold), whereas contribution margin uses the total variable costs. When using this ratio to compare, between products or companies for example, it is important that the same costs are included in both calculations. For instance, some sales costs may be regarded as fixed, others as variable.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Total debt to total assets is one of the ratios used to measure a company’s financial risk. It determines what proportion of the company’s assets is financed by debt. The lower a company’s total debt to total assets ratio, the less leveraged the company is. That is, the less borrowing the company has. This makes the company safer from a creditor’s point of view but provides less return for shareholders. This is because the shareholders are financing a greater proportion of the business.</p>

<p>A ratio of less than one – as is the case with both companies in the above example – indicates that the majority of a company’s assets are financed through equity. More than one shows that they are financed more by debt. The higher the ratio, the more highly leveraged the company.</p>
<p>This could prove to be an issue, particularly in a rising interest rate environment when the company could be in trouble if it had difficulty paying back debt and its creditors demanded repayment.</p>
<p>A general principle is that companies with stable earnings can support higher debt ratios with less risk than companies with more volatile earning streams</p>
<p>The total debt to total assets ratio is a broad one since it takes into account both current and fixed, tangible and intangible assets, and both long and short-term debt. It is a useful (if crude) tool for treasurers when making investment or counterparty decisions. Companies with higher ratios are, generally, higher risk investments, and vice versa.</p>

<p>Risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC) is a profitability metric that can be used to analyse return in relation to the level of risk taken on. It can be used to compare the performance of several investments with differing levels of risk exposure. It should not be confused with RORAC (return on risk-adjusted capital) which adjusts the capital invested based on the risks being taken. RAROC instead adjusts the return itself. RAROC was developed by Bankers Trust in the late 1970s and early 1980s in response to regulatory interest in the capital ratios of financial institutions and the implementation of capital adequacy regulations. RAROC is often used by banks to determine the amount of capital required to support the bank’s activities.</p>

<p>Bankers Trust was a US investment bank which was bought by Deutsche Bank in 1998 for $10.8 billion. The bank was a major player in the derivatives business and a leader in developing risk management techniques but suffered financial and reputational damage following client losses on complex derivative trades which eventually led to the acquisition by Deutsche Bank.</p>

<p>RARORAC, the risk-adjusted return on risk-adjusted capital, combines RAROC with RORAC to adjust both the return and the capital based on the risks being taken. An example of this is Basel II which specifies regulations regarding the basic capital requirement to be held by international banks. Basel II states that banks must adjust their capital levels in relation to the level of credit risk, market risk and operational risk involved in the bank’s operational activities. The formula used to calculate the minimum level required is roughly as follows:</p>

<p>As a result, RARORAC is being used more and more as a measure to assess the risk-adjusted economic capital and the risk-adjusted return on an investment, where the risk adjustment for capital is based on the capital adequacy guidelines shown above.</p>
<h3 id="points-to-consider">Points to consider</h3>
<p>The use of risk-adjusted capital enables companies to determine the level of risk in each individual line of business and thus allocate the required amount of capital accordingly. The use of risk adjusted returns can be used to measure performance, which can aid the effective diversification of the composition of an investment portfolio. Shareholder value can similarly be increased by the reallocation of capital to areas of the business based on the economic value added. It is important to remember that although these ratios allow for the incorporation of market risk, credit risk and operational risk, they do not encompass systemic risks, so these must be calculated separately.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>The Treynor ratio, developed by Jack Treynor in 1965, is a measure of the return on a portfolio in excess of the return on a risk-free investment in relation to systematic risk. It is similar to the Sharpe ratio, as discussed in February’s issue, except that it uses systematic risk, or beta, as a measure of volatility, rather than standard deviation. Systematic risk, also known as un-diversifiable risk or market risk, covers risks such as interest rates and recession that affect the entire market and cannot be mitigated by diversification, only by hedging.</p>
<h3 id="how is it calculated">How is it calculated?</h3>
<p>Like the Sharpe ratio, the Treynor ratio uses the excess return, which is the difference between the return on the portfolio in question and the return on a risk-free investment. This is then divided by the portfolio’s systematic risk:</p>

<p>The measure of risk used, beta 
		<math>
<mrow>
<mo>ß</mo>
</mrow>
</math>, is systematic risk. A portfolio’s beta is a measure of how susceptible it is to changes in the market as a whole. The price of a portfolio with a beta of 1, for example, will move with the market. A beta of 0.5 indicates a portfolio that is 50% less volatile than the market, and a portfolio with a beta of 1.5 will be 50% more volatile than the market.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>A company wants to monitor the performance of its investment manager who has produced returns of 20%, by making an adjustment for the level of risk he has taken on. The beta of the portfolio is 1.4. The risk-free rate of return is 5%:</p>

</figure>
<p>So, whilst the portfolio produced a good return, much of that was attributable to a relatively high level of risk rather than superior investment decisions.</p>
<h3 id="points-to-consider">Points to consider</h3>
<p>Since the Treynor ratio uses beta as its measure of portfolio volatility, it does not take into account any other risk besides market risk. It does not allow for unsystematic risk, for example, which is specific to each investment and must be mitigated through diversification. As a result of this limitation, Treynor went on to develop his ideas further with the Treynor-Black model.</p>
<h3 id="treynor-black-model">Treynor-Black model</h3>
<p>The Treynor-Black model was developed by Jack Treynor in collaboration with Fischer Black in 1973. The purpose of this model is to determine the most advantageous asset allocation in an investment portfolio by assessing unsystematic risk in addition to systematic risk. Unsystematic risk is company or industry-specific risk that directly affects each investment in that company or industry. So, whilst the Treynor ratio neglects the issue of the need for a diversified portfolio, the Treynor-Black model provides a measure of return that, by taking unsystematic risk into account, rewards diversification.</p>
<p>The Treynor-Black model involves the investment manager being able to predict the abnormal performance of a security (alpha α), that is its return over and above that explained by its beta and the security market line. An optimal portfolio will consist of two parts: the passively managed or market portfolio based on the expected risk and return parameters of the market as a whole, and the actively managed portfolio which contains those securities for which the investment manager has made predictions about alpha.</p>
<p>Each security in the actively managed portfolio is weighted according to the ratio of its alpha to its unsystematic risk. This then allows the investment manager to calculate the ideal ratio of actively to passively managed assets in a portfolio. Treasurers can use the Treynor ratio (in conjunction with other metrics) in order to keep track of the level of their investments’ exposure to risk. Systematic or market risk, in particular, is a key consideration in volatile markets.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>The Sharpe ratio was developed by William Forsyth Sharpe in 1966 and subsequently revised by its creator in 1994. It is the most commonly used measure of risk-adjusted performance. The calculation takes into account the rate of return on a portfolio in relation to its volatility and provides a measure of how far the returns on a portfolio are due to wise investment decisions as opposed to excess levels of risk. It does this by determining the reward per unit of risk.</p>
<p>The Sharpe ratio is also a useful tool for investors seeking to determine whether the excess return generated on a higher-risk asset adequately compensates for the increased level of exposure to risk. The risk-adjustment feature of the Sharpe ratio enables direct comparison of the performance of two portfolios, regardless of their volatility.</p>
<h3 id="how-is-it-calculated">How is it calculated?</h3>
<p>The Sharpe ratio takes the difference in return between the portfolio in question and a risk-free investment. This gives the excess return. In order to account for the level of risk involved, the excess return is divided by the standard deviation of the return on the portfolio:</p>

<p>This is the standard deviation of the return on the portfolio. The greater the standard deviation, the greater the risk/volatility of the portfolio.</p>

</ul>
<p>The Sharpe ratio can be used to analyse historical returns and also to predict expected returns. When comparing two portfolios against the same benchmark risk-free rate of return, the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio will offer the greatest return per unit of risk. A portfolio with a negative Sharpe ratio would be considered an unwise investment since it will be expected to show a lower return per unit of risk than a risk-free asset. The Sharpe ratio of a portfolio is also affected by diversification as this minimises the risk of the investment, thus decreasing the standard deviation.</p>
<h4 id="example">Example</h4>
<p>Investment manager A generates a return of 12%, whilst investment manager B generates a return of 9%. This would indicate that A’s investment portfolio performed better than B’s. Assuming that the risk-free rate of return is 2.5%, and that the standard deviations of each portfolio are 6% and 4% respectively:</p>

<p>This shows that, despite investing in lower-risk assets than investment manager A, investment manager B succeeded in generating a better rate of risk-adjusted return.</p>
<h4 id="points-to-consider">Points to consider</h4>
<p>The Sharpe ratio is most successful for calculating the risk-adjusted return on liquid investments with normally distributed returns. Any anomalies in the distribution of portfolio returns will restrict the effectiveness of the standard deviation as a measure of risk. For this reason the Sharpe ratio is not usually an appropriate measure of risk-adjusted return for hedge funds. Also, hedge funds that are illiquid appear to be less volatile, which would thus positively affect their Sharpe ratio. Since the Sharpe ratio contains no measure of illiquidity it sometimes provides a misleading measure of risk-adjusted return.</p>
<p>It is important that treasurers understand the Sharpe ratio, as it provides a guide as to the optimum level of risk exposure for generating the best returns, and can help to keep investments in line with company policy on the appropriate balance of risk and reward.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that CAPM was developed as a predictive model to provide the expected return on an investment; it does not have the benefit of hindsight. Many of the criticisms levelled at CAPM arise from actual observed figures calculated after the event. There are many reasons why an investment may not meet its expected return; some alternatives to CAPM have been developed in an attempt to take these factors into account:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Arbitrage pricing theory.</h5>
<p>This theory takes into account macroeconomic factors and possible market imperfections. It uses individual risk calculations for each identified factor that may affect the investment’s expected return.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>The three-factor model.</h5>
<p>This model takes into account the return on assets in the market as a whole, the size of the investment and the effect of differing book-to-market ratios.</p>

<p>Another weakness is that the CAPM is theoretical; it assumes, for example, that trade is conducted tax-free and without transaction costs, and that all investors agree upon the beta of an investment.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Gross profit margin, sometimes referred to as ‘mark-up’ or ‘margin’, is the percentage profit made from revenue less the cost of goods sold.  Gross profit margin is a good measure of financial health, since it is essentially the source of funding for other expenses, such as distribution and sales costs.</p>
<p>Gross profit margin may be used as a tool for comparing a company’s performance with its peers.  The company with the greatest gross profit margin would be deemed the most efficient.  Alternatively it could indicate that the company is overcharging for its products; this could present an issue if a competitor were to enter the market offering lower prices.</p>

<p>Although the gross profit margin is the same for both years, 2009 earnings are much lower than those for 2008.  This demonstrates the importance of using gross profit margin in conjunction with other financial metrics.</p>
<h4 id="points-to-consider">Points to consider</h4>
<p>In general a company’s gross profit margin would be expected to remain fairly stable from one year to the next.  Any major fluctuations in gross profit margin may be attributable to fraudulent activity or accounting irregularities, thus making it advisable to monitor gross profit margin closely.  A gradual decline in gross profit margin may indicate a drop in efficiency or that selling prices are under pressure.</p>
<p>It is also important to monitor gross profit margin in the context of market conditions.  If the cost of raw materials increases, for example, and the company does nothing to account for these rising costs, this will have a negative impact on gross profit margin.  Equally, in the wake of the financial crisis, companies have generally responded by lowering prices in order to boost sales.  This will also be manifested in a drop in gross profit margin.  Consequently, gross profit margin can also be used as an indication of a company’s ability to adapt to a changing economic environment.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>A particularly useful measure for companies operating in jurisdictions that use a progressive tax system, the effective tax rate (ETR) is a measure of the average rate of tax paid on total corporate income. The ETR can also be used as a comparative measure of profitability – for example, average effective tax rates can help determine whether firms in similar circumstances are paying approximately the same level of tax, therefore indicating whether their taxable income is in a similar bracket.</p>
<aside class="definition">
<h5 id="progressive-tax-system">Progressive tax system</h5>
<p>‘Progressive’ means that the percentage of tax payable increases with the amount of taxable income generated.</p>
</aside>
<h3 id="how-is-it-calculated">How is it calculated?</h3>
<p>A company’s simple ETR, expressed as a percentage, can be calculated using the following formula:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mtext>Effective tax rate</mtext>
<mo>=</mo>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mtext>Income tax expense</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>pre-tax income</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>The income tax expense and pre-tax income figures can be found in the company’s income statement, also known as the profit &amp; loss (P&amp;L) statement.</p>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>For the 2008 tax year, company XYZ had a provision for income taxes of $385,007,598. The company’s pre-tax income over that period was $1,321,857,606. Using the above formula, we can calculate the company’s ETR to be:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mfrac>

<mn>29.1</mn>
<mo>%</mo>
</math>
</figure>
<h3 id="lowering-the-effective-tax-rate">Lowering the effective tax rate</h3>
<p>If a company can reduce its ETR, it can thereby increase its net profit margin as less tax expenditure is required. Although the use of aggressive accounting tactics may be employed to do this, this would not necessarily be seen as a good idea. Operationally-based measures should certainly be considered.</p>
<p>Companies may, for example, maximise profits in lower tax countries in order to reduce their taxable income – this is particularly true in jurisdictions where progressive tax systems are in place. See the table for an example of how the US corporate tax rate varies and will change a company’s ETR.</p>
<figure>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Taxable income ($)</th>
<th>US tax rate</th>

</figure>
<p>Moving profits may entail setting prices for transactions between subsidiaries, known as ‘transfer pricing’. Tax authorities are well aware that this can be used to move profitability from one country to another so they carefully monitor this aspect.</p>
<p>Another way that companies can look at decreasing their ETR is by ‘shopping around’ for tax concessions. In large countries, such as the United States and China, there may be tax incentives available in certain areas of the country, as individual provinces or states offer incentives to attract companies to operate in their areas. This research would be best done before an operation is set up as a change of location can turn out to be more costly then the potential tax saving.</p>
<p>Tax planning is a complex subject which every international company should consider with the aim of minimising but not evading a fair level of taxation.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Price-to-sales ratio]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>The price-to-sales ratio (PSR) measures the relationship between the value of stock and the level of sales a company is experiencing as a result of its operating activities.   It provides a useful way to compare a company’s activity with both its competitors and its own past performance.</p>
<p>The PSR is calculated by dividing the individual share price by the annual revenue per share.  The formula is as follows:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mtext>PSR</mtext>
<mo>=</mo>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mtext>Share price</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>Revenue per share</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>For example, if the company’s share price was $40 and the revenue per share was $32, the PSR would be 40/32 = 1.25.</p>
<p>PSR can also be calculated by using the following alternative formula:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mtext>PSR</mtext>
<mo>=</mo>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mtext>Market cap</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>Annual revenue</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>

<h4 id="market-cap">Market cap</h4>
<p>Market cap (capitalisation) is the share price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding.  It shows the market value of a company’s equity.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-it-used-for">What is it used for?</h3>
<p>PSR shows investors the value of their investment.  Theoretically, if a company’s PSR is high, it shows that investors are paying more for the company’s sales than if the PSR were low.  Therefore a low PSR traditionally signifies better value.  However revenue is not the same as profit – nor the same as cash flow – so PSR is just one measure that helps investors know when the price of stocks is right for them.</p>
<p>In the 1990s there was a spectacular growth in young internet companies with high sales but no profit and although this is now in the past, there are still a number of new companies with low or no earnings.  Established companies may likewise experience periods where they produce no profits.  Calculations which deal with earnings, such as EPS (earnings per share), cannot therefore be used to determine the value of these companies’ stocks.  PSR is based on sales rather than on earnings, so it is ideal for calculating the value of a company with no earnings history.  The underlying assumption is that profits will be made once market share is established.</p>
<p>PSR is sometimes seen as a more reliable performance indicator because sales statistics are harder to manipulate than earnings.</p>
<h3 id="problems-with-psr">Problems with PSR</h3>
<p>This particular ratio can be misleading because unlike earnings, sales figures do not take a company’s expenses or debt into account.  It is possible for a company to have a low PSR as a result of its massive debt and/or lack of a profitable business model.  In such cases a low PSR would not represent a bargain.</p>
<p>What is classed as a ‘normal’ PSR varies according to industry.  When using PSR to compare companies, it is therefore important to remember that it may not give an accurate cross-industry picture and is best used when comparing similar companies.</p>
<p>As with most ratios, it is important to consider other relevant factors and alternative metrics when determining the value of a company’s shares.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<h3 id="dividend-yield">Dividend yield</h3>
<p>Dividend yield is a ratio that shows the return a company pays its shareholders.  It can be multiplied by 100 to give a percentage.  The ratio is calculated as follows:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mtext>Dividend yield</mtext>
<mo>=</mo>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mtext>Annual dividends per share</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>Price per share</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>If two companies returned $2 on each share then investors with the same number of shares would make the same amount of money whichever they invested in.  However, if Company A’s shares were priced at $10 each and Company B’s shares were priced at $20 each, Company A’s shares would provide a greater return relative to the market price of the shares.  This is shown by the dividend yield, which for Company A is 0.2 or 20%, whereas for Company B it is 0.1 or only 10%.</p>
<h3 id="dps">DPS</h3>
<p>The dividend per share (DPS) ratio determines the amount of dividend shareholders will receive for each of their shares over the course of a year.  It is calculated as follows:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mtext>DPS</mtext>
<mo>=</mo>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mtext>Total dividend paid</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>Number of shares in issue</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>The total dividend paid is the total amount paid in dividends over one year.  The number of shares in the issue refers to the number of common shares outstanding.  A weighted average is often used to determine the number of shares in the issue when this varies during the year.</p>
<p>Dividends are paid to shareholders who are registered as shareholders on the ‘record date’, which the company declares in advance.  The actual payment is made a short time later.  Until the payment is made, the shares are traded ‘ex-div’ to make it clear that the declared but unpaid dividend will go to the seller – not the buyer – of the shares.  Companies may also decide to make interim dividend payments during the year, normally just one.  Both these payments need to be combined to work out the total dividend paid for the DPS ratio.  Extraordinary dividends (dividends that are not covered in the company’s dividend policy and are not paid regularly) are not usually included in the DPS calculation.</p>
<h3 id="dividend-cover">Dividend cover</h3>
<p>The dividend cover ratio gauges the ability of the company to pay out its dividends.  It is calculated as follows:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mtext>Dividend cover</mtext>
<mo>=</mo>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mtext>EPS</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>DPS</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>So a company with an EPS (Earnings Per Share) of $6 and a DPS of $2 would have a dividend cover of 3.  This means that the company’s earnings or profits cover its dividend payments three times over.  Dividend cover helps investors gauge how easily a company is able to pay its dividends.  A dividend cover of more than 2 is deemed relatively safe.  It is possible for a company to have dividend cover of less than one.  If this happens it means that the company must use any reserves to pay dividends, since this year’s profits are not enough.</p>
<p>A high dividend cover can be good or bad depending on the investor’s perspective.  If an investor is looking for instant profits, he or she may be dissatisfied with a high dividend cover because it means that the company is not distributing a large proportion of its profits as dividends.  However, this means that the money can be invested back into the business, so an investor looking for long-term growth may feel that a high dividend cover is ideal.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>The earnings per share (EPS) calculation is used to gauge the value of a company’s stock by calculating the amount of the company’s net earnings that is allocated to each outstanding common share.  The formula used to determine EPS is as follows:</p>
<figure>
<math>

</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>Weighted average of outstanding common shares</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>For instance, if a company’s net income was $40m, it paid out $2m in dividends on preferred stock and the weighted average number of its outstanding common shares was 20m, the formula for working out its EPS would be:</p>
<figure>

<p>Outstanding shares are those owned by members of the public and investors, as well as restricted shares owned by individual members of the company.  Outstanding shares do not include shares that have been repurchased by the company itself.</p>
<p>Preferred stock often entails restricted voting rights for its holder and pays out a fixed amount in dividends.  Preferred stock is subtracted from the net income because it takes precedence over common stock.  Therefore, if the dividends on preferred stock total $2m, that money will not be available for common stock.</p>
<p>Weighted average is used to incorporate any changes in the number of shares over the period in question.  For instance, if our company had 16m stocks in the first half of the year and increased that number to 24m in the second half, the weighted average would be worked out thus:</p>

<p>The above EPS calculation is a basic version.  It is possible to adapt the calculation to take into account common stock plus all its equivalents, such as convertible bonds and warrants, by adding these to the denominator.  In this case the formula is referred to as ‘fully diluted’.  There are also different forms of EPS depending on the time period used: trailing (using past figures), current (using this year’s figures) and forward (using projected figures).</p>
<h4 id="when-is-eps-used">When is EPS used?</h4>
<p>EPS is useful when comparing different companies’ shares to assess their relative values and is used in the Price Earnings to Growth (PEG) ratio, which is used to reveal the market value of a share’s growth potential.  Publicly traded companies operating in China are required by the China Securities Regulatory Commission to disclose both their basic and diluted EPS in a data list along with other information relating to shareholder positions.</p>
<h4 id="a-word-of-warning">A word of warning</h4>
<p>EPS is best used as one of the measures of the value of a company’s stock.  It is not possible to use it to get an exact valuation because other relevant factors are excluded.   Most importantly, it does not take the market value of the stock into account and its use is therefore limited.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Employee ratios have become of particular importance over the last 18 months as companies have been obliged to review costs and make redundancies where appropriate. Investors also frequently use employee ratios to measure how efficient a business is. In this article, we look at some of the most commonly used employee ratios as well as their application in today’s business environment.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-employee-ratios">What are employee ratios?</h3>
<p>Employee ratios are often used as a rough measure of the productivity and efficiency of a company’s workforce, and as such they are sometimes referred to as productivity metrics. There is a range of employee ratios available for companies to use and the ones that are most appropriate will inevitably vary according to the company’s line of business.

<h3 id="why-use-employee-ratios">Why use employee ratios?</h3>
<p>Although the application of employee ratios varies between industry sectors, they are frequently used in the service industry, where staffing levels are high. These ratios can assist in determining the level of sales that a business needs in order to ensure that the workforce is functioning efficiently, ie that employees are working to maximum capacity and that the firm is not either over- or understaffed.</p>
<p>Employee metrics can also have a financial impact on the company: for instance, if productivity can be increased without employing extra staff, this should in theory lead to a rise in profits.</p>
<h3 id="points-to-consider">Points to consider</h3>
<p>As with many financial metrics, there are several factors which can affect the relevance of employee ratios, particularly when comparing one company with another. Factors to consider when using employee ratios include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Industry sector.</h5>
<p>The number of employees required in a labour-intensive retail environment will differ greatly from, for example, an intellectually based company, such as a software development house. Therefore, it is important to compare like-with-like, rather than across industry sectors.</p>
</li>

<h5>Whether employees are working full or part-time.</h5>
<p>Where the company has part-time employees, it will be necessary to calculate approximately the number of full-time equivalents. This figure can be estimated by dividing the total part-time employees’ working hours per week by those of one full-time employee, say 40 hours a week. For example, if Pedro works 20 hours a week, and Margaret works 25 hours a week, they are equivalent to 1.125 full-time employees:

</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Contract workers.</h5>
<p>Companies using temporary or contract workers will also need to take into account that these workers should not technically be included in such calculations as they are not employees of the firm. This will of course affect the outcome of the metrics, particularly if a large proportion of the workforce is made up of contractors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Timeframe.</h5>
<p>Employee ratios can also be used to monitor ongoing performance and/or trends within a single company or between companies. It is advisable to use a timeframe of at least three years to ensure that trend patterns are reliable.</p>

<p>The price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) measures the value that the stock market places on a company relative to its book value. The P/B ratio is also sometimes referred to as the price-equity ratio and is often used by investors looking to find undervalued companies; that is, companies that look cheap at their current market price.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-book-value">What is book value?</h3>
<p>Book value is short for book value of equity and is sometimes known as net asset value (NAV). Book value relates to the company’s value according to its balance sheet, and represents common stock shareholder equity (plus reserves and less any intangible assets on the balance sheet such as goodwill). It is thus an estimate of the liquidation value of a company. Book value is calculated as follows:</p>

<mtext>liabilities</mtext>
<mo> + </mo>
<mtext>intangible assets</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfenced>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>In order to calculate the P/B ratio however, it is necessary to know the book value per share of the company. This can be calculated by dividing the book value by the number of common shares outstanding.</p>
<h3 id="calculating-the-p-b-ratio">Calculating the P/B ratio</h3>
<p>The value that is placed on a company by the stock market is quite simply the company’s current share price, so the P/B ratio is:</p>

<p>For example, Company F has total assets of €63,522 on its balance sheet and liabilities and intangible assets of €50,178. There are currently 8,000 Company F shares outstanding and the market price for one share is €3.24.</p>
<p>Company F’s book value per share is:</p>

<h3 id="interpretation-of-results">Interpretation of results</h3>
<p>Although the P/B ratio is considered by many to be relatively simplistic, it does provide a quick overview as to the value of a company. During bull markets, it is not uncommon to see market values far exceeding book values, and therefore high P/B ratios, but during bear markets it is more likely that the two values will be similar, and the P/B ratio will therefore be nearer to 1.</p>
<p>If a company has a high P/B ratio, this could mean that it is overvalued. However, if the share price is higher than the book price, this could also indicate that market predictions for the company’s future are good and earning potential is high.</p>
<p>Value investors, such as Warren Buffet, tend to look for companies with a P/B of less than 1, as this could mean that the stock is undervalued and therefore has a potential profit in it. However, there might also be good reason for the company to have a low standing in the market, such as poor outlook. Moreover, consumer and service orientated companies will frequently have negative P/B ratios. This does not necessarily mean that they have growth potential; it might just be that the company has relatively more liabilities than assets.</p>
<p>The P/B ratio should therefore be used in conjunction with other analytical tools and financial measurements, such as the return on equity, in order to provide a complete picture. Cash flow and volatility of earnings are also important elements to consider.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Debt to equity ratio]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>The debt to equity ratio is used to determine the relative proportion of equity and debt used to finance a company. This ratio is particularly useful in assessing the strength of a company’s balance sheet.</p>
<p>The debt to equity ratio is calculated as follows:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mtext>Debt to equity ratio</mtext>
<mo>=</mo>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mtext>debt</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>equity</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>For example, if a company has RMB 80m in debt and has equity totalling RMB 200m, its debt to equity ratio would be 80/200 or 0.40. The result is often multiplied by 100 to get a percentage, which in this case would be 40%. This is the percentage of the company that is leveraged (financed by debt). A higher number indicates that a greater proportion of debt is employed by the company.</p>
<h4 id="what-does-it-include">What does it include?</h4>
<p>When using the debt to equity ratio, all the shareholders’ equity – both invested capital and retained earnings – must be included as equity.</p>
<p>Debt should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All interest-bearing liabilities on the balance sheet, such as capital leases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Off-balance sheet liabilities, such as operating leases and pensions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible, however, to use only interest-bearing, long-term debt in an amended version of the ratio to give a purely long-term view of the company’s financing.</p>
<h4 id="what-does-it-mean">What does it mean?</h4>
<p>If a company is highly leveraged, this means that it is largely financed by debt. If a company is not highly leveraged, it is largely financed by equity. A company will normally benefit from having a certain amount of debt, as this can be used to fund investments that give a return which is greater than the cost of the debt. This gives an additional return to the shareholders and is described as leveraging their equity investment.</p>
<p>However, the more debt used to finance a company, the greater the risk to the shareholders if the company experiences any volatility in earnings. Providers of debt have to be paid interest. Shareholders are always the last to receive any money from a company in which they have invested, so a highly leveraged company would have to pay interest to all of its creditors before the shareholders saw a return on their investment. Lenders also expect their loans to be repaid or refinanced over time.</p>
<p>What represents a healthy debt to equity ratio varies from one company to another and there are many pages of academic research on the subject. Essentially the more stable and reliable a company’s earnings are, the more appropriate a higher level of debt is. It is also highly dependent on a number of other factors; not least the social and economic climate of the time and how the company and its industrial sector are regarded by lenders, analysts and investors.</p>
<h4 id="why-use-it">Why use it?</h4>
<p>The debt to equity ratio has a number of applications. A company can use its debt to equity ratio to help determine whether it is highly leveraged compared to its competitors, thereby using their situations to reflect on its own. It is also advisable to measure a debt to equity ratio over several years to identify trends over time rather than just a snapshot of the company’s financial status. Continued use of the debt to equity ratio at regular intervals over a number of years may also be useful to help detect signs of any emerging debt problems.</p>
<p>However, the debt to equity ratio should not be used as the sole indicator of a company’s dependence on debt financing. There are many other ratios, such as the debt ratio (total debt/total assets) and current ratio (current assets/current liabilities), which can be used in tandem with the debt to equity ratio to provide a more comprehensive view of a company’s leverage.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Working capital turnover ratio]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>This month, in the last of our series on turnover ratios, we examine the working capital turnover ratio. The working capital turnover ratio is an activity ratio that measures how many times working capital is used to generate sales, ie revenue, during a specific time period. As such, the ratio is a good indicator of company growth and liquidity and is calculated as follows:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mtext>Working capital turnover</mtext>
<mo> = </mo>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mtext>net sales</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>working capital</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>The ratio is sometimes known as the capital turnover ratio, as net sales to working capital, or by the acronym WCTO.</p>
<p>Working capital is generally calculated as the company’s current assets less its current liabilities. Current assets include inventory and accounts receivable together with all other assets that will be held for less than 12 months. Current liabilities include accounts payable and payroll as well as any other liabilities, eg taxes, due in under a year.</p>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>Company XYZ’s net sales year-to-date are €189,445, its current assets are €85,361, and its current liabilities are €43,262. Using the above equation, company XYZ’s working capital turnover is:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mn>189,445</mn>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mfenced>

</mrow>
</mfenced>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
<mo>=</mo>
<mn>4.5</mn>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>This means that during the period, the company has used (and of course replaced) its working capital 4.5 times to generate sales.</p>
<h3 id="interpretation-of-results">Interpretation of results</h3>
<p>As with the majority of turnover ratios, the results should be interpreted on an industry sector basis to provide an accurate benchmark. However, in general, a high working capital turnover ratio usually indicates that the company is actively generating sales from its working capital, which is a positive indicator of future prospects. If the ratio increases significantly over the years however, or seems excessively high in relation to sector peers, this could indicate that the company is overtrading, ie taking on large orders that it does not have the resources to fulfil, and/or that a high proportion of the business’s assets are fixed assets (ie long-term assets such as buildings and machinery that are not easily converted into cash). Being top-heavy on fixed assets brings the available working capital down and means that the company lacks liquidity. This lack of liquidity could mean that the company would struggle to pay all of its debts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a low working capital turnover ratio could point to inefficiencies as the company is not generating a significant return on its assets, which can signal financial difficulty. Some companies, particularly those that are going through periods of rapid growth, do however run with negative working capital as they are able to generate cash extremely quickly. This is often the case in the food outlet or restaurant industry as customers pay for the goods up front. If the company’s working capital turnover is negative, this may be a sign of an efficient business strategy, particularly if inventory is tactically low, ie just sufficient to meet demand. A well-known organisation that has operated using this business model is McDonalds.</p>
<p>Many companies on the verge of bankruptcy also have negative working capital turnover though, so it is important to make sure that a company with negative working capital turnover has both low inventory and accounts receivable. If the company has high accounts receivable, this may indicate that it is not collecting its debts efficiently and that products have not been paid for up front. This, combined with a low inventory, would mean that the company is owed money and yet has no stock to sell to cover these debts.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>The accounts receivable turnover ratio is an accounting measure used to quantify the liquidity of a firm’s accounts receivable and therefore how effectively a company uses its assets. The ratio is not just a measure of how efficiently a company collects its debts though, as the credit terms extended are also an important part of the equation.</p>
<p>Accounts receivable turnover is calculated using the following formula:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mtext>Accounts receivable turnover</mtext>
<mo> = </mo>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mext>Net credit sales</mext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>Average accounts receivable</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>The ratio is generally used for a year-to-year calculation and is sometimes known as the sales-to-receivables ratio or simply the receivables ratio.</p>
<p>Average accounts receivable can be calculated in several different ways. Some firms take an average of the opening day of the year and the closing day of the year, and other firms use monthly averages to derive a yearly average. The monthly approach will give a more realistic result as the first method only takes into account two days from a 365 day period and ignores any cyclical changes during the year. We will however use the first method in our example to give a simpler calculation.</p>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>Company XYZ had net credit sales of €60,555,132 for 2007 and its accounts receivable, net for the beginning and end of 2007, were €3,532,101 and €3,476,958 respectively. Company XYZ’s accounts receivable turnover ratio is:</p>
<figure>
<math>

</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mfenced>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
<mo>=</mo>
<mn>17.3</mn>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>In practice this means that the company collects its average accounts receivable 17.3 times each year. Looked at differently, it also means that the company takes an average of 21.1 days (365/17.3) to collect on its accounts – this figure is known as the average collections period.</p>
<h3 id="annualising">Annualising</h3>
<p>Although not common practice, some companies will monitor accounts receivable turnover on a quarterly basis. It is possible to annualise these figures by using the above ratio and multiplying the answer by four. However, this approach would not be recommended for industries where sales vary significantly throughout the year as the ratio can become distorted.</p>
<h3 id="interpretation-of-results">Interpretation of results</h3>
<p>As a general rule, the higher the ratio, the tighter the company’s credit policy as the faster the business is at collecting its receivables. It is possible for credit policies to be too tight, however, and companies should consider whether they are losing out on possible sales as a result of being too restrictive. This could, in turn, negatively impact the organic growth of the company. Normally, a low receivables turnover ratio means that the business should revisit its credit policies to ensure the timely collection of its receivables. This will help the company to earn more interest as outstanding receivables are effectively interest free loans. Bad debts may also be partly responsible for a low AR turnover ratio.</p>
<h3 id="points-to-consider">Points to consider</h3>
<p>The overall level of the ratio will vary from industry to industry and it is important to benchmark with sector peers when comparing companies.</p>
<p>Many companies do not disclose figures for their sales made on credit, and as such some investors will make the accounts receivable turnover calculation based on total sales. However, if all sales are included in the calculation, the resulting ratio could be skewed if the proportion of cash sales is particularly high.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Constructing a zero-coupon yield curve]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>The zero-coupon yield curve can be constructed using a series of coupon-paying bonds using an iterative technique known as ‘bootstrapping’. This works on the premise that the investor ‘borrows’ money today, the day that the bond is purchased, to compensate for not receiving any coupons over the life of the bond. In this example we use the following bonds which pay annual coupons and assume that the one year interest rate is 6%.</p>
<figure>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Price ($)</th>
<th>Coupon ($)</th>
<th>Maturity</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody class="td-right">
<tr>
<td>98.435</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>2 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>96.784</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>3 years</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</figure>
<h4 id="two-year-maturity">Two year maturity</h4>
<p>The investor pays $98.435 for $100 face value of the two year bond. They will receive $5 (the coupon) in one year and $105 (the coupon and repayment at par) at the end of two years. By discounting the cash flows we can create a synthetic two year zero-coupon bond. In order to calculate how much the investor will need to ‘borrow’, we will need to work out the present value of the coupon today, using the following formula:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mtext>Present value </mtext>
<mfenced>
<mtext>PV</mtext>
</mfenced>
<mo>=</mo>
<mfrac>

<mi><sup>n </sup></mi>
<mfenced>
<mtext>number of years</mtext>
</mfenced>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>In our instance the first interest payment is discounted as: 5/(1+0.06)1 = 4.717. The initial outlay is therefore $93.718 and the $4.717 is notionally repaid with interest (making $5) after one year:</p>
<figure>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Year</th>
<th>Actual cash flows</th>
<th>Notional cash flows</th>
<th>Net cash flows</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>0</th>
<td>-98.435 (paid for bond)</td>
<td>+4.717 (notionally borrowed)</td>
<td>-93.718</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>1</th>
<td>+ 5 (coupon after one year)</td>
<td>-5 (notionally repaid)</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>2</th>
<td>+105 (coupon and repayment at par)</td>
<td></td>
<td>+105</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</figure>
<p>The rate which discounts $105 to $93.718 is the two year zero-coupon rate. To calculate this, we use the following formula:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mtext>Interest rate </mtext>

<mtext><sup>number of years (n)</sup></mtext>
<mo>-</mo>
<mn>1</mn>

</figure>
<p>So the two year zero-coupon rate in our instance is 5.848%, calculated from:</p>
<figure>
<math>

<mo>-</mo>
<mn>1</mn>
<mo>=</mo>
<mn>0.05848</mn>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<h4 id="three-year-maturity">Three year maturity</h4>
<p>We can calculate a three year zero-coupon rate in the same way. First we identify how much the investor would need to borrow to eliminate the impact of the two interim coupons of $4. By using the PV method outlined above, we can calculate that the investor would need to borrow $3.774 today to match the coupon of $4 in one year. We also need to calculate how much the investor would need to borrow today, to match the anticipated two year coupon receipt of another $4. For this, we use the two year rate which will be the same as the zero-coupon rate we calculated earlier – 5.848%. Therefore, the investor would need to borrow $3.570 today to receive $4 in two years. That makes a total borrowing of $7.344 and the initial outlay is therefore $89.440 (96.784 – 7.344).</p>
<p>Using the i = (FV/PV)1/n – 1 formula , we can then derive the three year zero-coupon rate – in this instance 5.16%: (104/89.440)1/3 – 1 = 0.0516. By extending the above method to different maturities, it will be possible to determine a series of zero-coupon yields which can be plotted against the term (in years) to construct the yield curve.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Inventory turnover is a ratio which indicates how frequently a business sells and replaces its inventory during the course of a year. The words inventory and stock are used interchangeably in this description and have the same meaning.</p>
<p>Tracking the turnover of a business in this way can be critical to successful financial planning, particularly if the business has significant assets tied up in inventory. For example, having high levels of inventory means that funds will be required to pay for storage of the stock. Money is also needed to purchase the inventory and to ensure that stock is available when it is required. This ratio can therefore help companies to monitor the level of stock that has to be maintained in order to meet the demands of their clients as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>Simple inventory turnover can be calculated as follows:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mtext>Inventory turnover</mtext>
<mo> = </mo>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mtext>sales</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>inventory</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>For example, we could say that Company ABC has sales of €20m and inventory of €25m for 2007. The company’s inventory turnover is therefore 0.8. This would be considered to be a fairly low figure and in practice it means that it would take the company more than a year to deplete its current inventory.</p>
<p>The inventory turnover ratio is most frequently used by investors as a simple efficiency ratio. As sales are recorded at market value however, this method can be substituted with the inventory to cost of goods sold (COGS) ratio, which can provide a more meaningful result as inventory is usually recorded at cost. Average inventory for the period can also improve the calculation if this helps to minimise the effect of seasonality:</p>
<figure>
<math>

</math>
</figure>
<p>Take for example Company XYZ where the cost of goods sold during 2007 was €26m, the beginning inventory was €6m and the ending inventory was €7m. 
Using the above formula, the average inventory is €6.5m and therefore the inventory turnover is 4.</p>
<h4 id="interpretation-of-results">Interpretation of results</h4>
<p>Ratios should be compared with industry averages as inventory is sector specific, with inventory turnover being higher when goods are perishable, for example. Trade association surveys are a useful source for locating a suitable industry ratio to use as a benchmark. Generally speaking however, a lower turnover ratio implies poor sales and/or poor inventory management together with overstocking, old stock becoming obsolete and possibly a poor product line or disappointing marketing campaign.</p>
<p>Conversely, a higher turnover rate could suggest strong sales. On the other hand, it could also be an indication of ineffective buying – ie the turnover is high and the inventory is small, but there may be insufficient stock to meet demand at peak times.</p>
<h4 id="advantages-and-disadvantages">Advantages and disadvantages</h4>
<p>The turnover ratio provides a two dimensional snapshot of a business which is undoubtedly useful to investors comparing companies and those in charge of inventory management. As with most ratios though, it is a purely mathematical measure which ignores the three dimensional practical and/or tactical sides of inventory. That is to say that a company may be strategically keeping its inventory high – for example, it may be stocking up on raw materials if a price rise is anticipated or if a shortage has been forecast.</p>
<p>It should be remembered that inventory yields zero return until sold and also expose the company to risk – both physically, for example if the stock is destroyed in a warehouse fire,sales and also economically, should prices fall.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Turnover ratios measure how effectively something is being used to generate cash. The asset turnover ratio (also known as the total asset turnover ratio) is used to determine the amount of sales that are generated from each euro/dollar/pound of a company’s assets.</p>
<p>The figure can also be used to provide an overview of a company’s pricing strategy. For example, companies operating with a high asset turnover tend to have lower profit margins than those with a low asset turnover.</p>
<p>Asset turnover is calculated using the following formula:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mtext>Asset turnover</mtext>
<mo> = </mo>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mtext>Sales revenue</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>Total assets</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>The higher the figure, the more efficiently the company is using its assets. However, the overall level of the ratio will vary from industry to industry.</p>
<h4 id="example">Example</h4>
<p>In 2007 Company A had €1.6m in revenue and total assets of €350,000. By using the formula above, we can determine that Company A’s asset turnover for 2007 was 4.57.</p>
<p>If Company A’s turnover was just €750,000 in 2008 but the company still held €350,000 worth of assets, the asset turnover would only be 2.14.</p>
<h4 id="interpretation-of-results">Interpretation of results</h4>
<p>One way of looking at the ratio is to say that in 2007 Company A was able to generate sales of €4.57 for every €1 of assets it owned. Alternatively, it can be interpreted as meaning that Company A’s assets were generated in sales 4.57 times that year.</p>
<p>While a falling asset turnover ratio could indicate that the company is using its assets less efficiently than before, other factors may also need to be taken into account. A falling ratio could simply indicate that the company has recently invested in assets that are not yet generating sales at their full capacity.</p>
<h4 id="variations">Variations</h4>
<p>In order to analyse the company’s use of its assets in more detail, the total asset turnover ratio can be divided in two: the fixed asset turnover ratio (calculated as Sales revenue/Fixed assets) and current asset turnover ratio (calculated as Sales revenue/Current assets).</p>
<p>Another related ratio is the assets to sales ratio, which is calculated as Total assets/Sales revenue – the inverse of the asset turnover ratio. This is used to calculate the amount of assets needed to produce one euro (or equivalent) of sales.</p>
<h4 id="considerations">Considerations</h4>
<p>A number of factors should be taken into consideration when using this ratio. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Different industries are associated with different typical ratios, so care should be taken when using the ratio as a benchmark.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The relationship between assets and sales generated will vary over time. For example, the purchase of a major asset will bring down the asset turnover ratio and it may take time for the asset to be used to generate sales.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conversely, while it may demonstrate that assets are being used efficiently, a high ratio could also indicate that the company’s assets were purchased some time ago and have depreciated in value.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Asset turnover provides a glimpse into the total success – or otherwise – of a particular company. It should always be used in conjunction with other information to give an accurate overview of the company’s performance.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Types of yield curve]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>In the previous issue of Treasury Today in China, we discussed the purpose of the yield curve and the two main calculations used to measure it – yield to maturity (YTM) and current yield. However, there are a number of different bases on which a yield curve may be constructed. Each uses a different bond profile to construct the expected term structure from which the yield curve is drawn.</p>
<p>Below we detail the four main types of curve:</p>
<h3 id="yield-to-maturity-ytm-curve">Yield to maturity (YTM) curve</h3>
<p>As we discussed in the previous issue, YTM is a measurement of the total income a bond is expected to generate until maturity. The most common type of yield curve, the yield to maturity curve (or simply the yield curve), demonstrates a link between the returns (yields) and maturity dates for a group of instruments with the same risk. A typical example is a yield curve constructed from yields on treasury bills of different maturities issued by a government.</p>
<p>The disadvantage of YTM is its underlying assumption that all cash flows are reinvested at the same rate as the yield of the bond.</p>
<h3 id="forward-rate-curve">Forward rate curve</h3>
<p>The forward rate curve is a graph of the forward rates implied by the yield curve. This recognises that interest rates will vary at different times during the period and illustrates the forward interest rates for each period shown on the yield curve. This curve is used to determine the prices of interest rate derivative instruments.</p>
<h3 id="par-yield-curve">Par yield curve</h3>
<p>Ideally, the yield curve is built using the YTM of a coupon-bearing instrument, such as a bond, whose market price is par (ie the same as its face value). In selecting bonds trading at par, an investor can eliminate the distortion caused by the different coupon rates payable on differently priced bonds. The yield on a par bond will be the same as the market rate.</p>
<p>Lower coupon bonds will be sold at a discount to compensate the investor for taking a below market coupon yield. Similarly, the investor will be required to pay more for a bond with a coupon that exceeds market rates. In either case, this distorts the yield curve on similar risk instruments.</p>
<p>As bonds pay different coupon rates, it is rare for many to be trading at par. As such, it may prove difficult to find bonds from which to construct a par yield curve.</p>
<h3 id="zero-coupon-yield-curve">Zero-coupon yield curve</h3>
<p>A zero-coupon instrument – such as a bond – is one that does not pay any interest (coupon) over the course of the term, but instead pays the investor the principal at maturity. Despite not earning any interest, investors gain from paying a discounted principal amount. Thus, all the yield is in the form of a capital gain.</p>
<p>The zero-coupon yield curve discounts that future single cash flow to gives its value today. Since there is only one payment, calculating the yield from its price (which is its net present value) is relatively simple. The advantage is that, in calculating the yield, the investor does not have to assume a reinvestment rate for any of the interim coupon payments associated with coupon-bearing bonds.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>The price to cash flow ratio (P/CF) is used to determine whether a company’s share price is high or low in the context of its cash flow. This measure is useful to investors, as its results provide an indicator for a company’s market value, as well as enabling competitor analysis among companies. Such a ratio can also be used as an indication of the future financial health of a company.</p>
<p>Similar to the price to earnings ratio (detailed in treasurytoday, June 2007), the price to cash flow ratio gives an indication of a company’s value relative to the market. While P/E is a better known measurement, many analysts view P/CF as a more accurate calculation because cash flow is less open to manipulation than net earnings figures. Cash flow is also viewed as a better indication of a company’s financial health.</p>
<p>To calculate P/CF, the following formula is used:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mi>P</mi>
<mo>/</mo>
<mtext>CF</mtext>
<mo> = </mo>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mtext>Share price</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>Cash flow per share</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>Where cash flow per share is calculated using the formula:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<figure>
<mtext>Cash flow per share</mtext>
<mo> = </mo>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mtext>Operating cash flow</mtext>
<mo> – </mo>
<mtext>preferred dividends</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>Number of common shares outstanding</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</figure>
</math>
</figure>
<p>For example, Company A has a share price of 350p per share and its cash flow per share is 30. We can calculate the price to cash flow ratio as follows:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mtext>Price to cash flow</mtext>
<mo> = </mo>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mn>350</mn>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mn>30</mn>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
<mo>=</mo>
<mn>11.67</mn>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>The resulting figure can be interpreted as indicating that the price that investors must pay for each £1 of cash flow generated by the company is £11.67 in stock. The lower the figure calculated, the more the company may be undervalued and this may present a good opportunity for investment.</p>
<p>One of the major benefits that arise from use of the P/CF ratio is that in using cash flows as opposed to net income, depreciation and amortisation charges are not deducted. As these are non-cash items, this calculation may provide a more accurate view of the company’s cash.</p>
<h3 id="problems-with-p-cf">Problems with P/CF</h3>
<p>Like many ratios offering an indication of a company’s market value, the price to cash flow ratio is predominantly expressed as a figure for the trailing twelve months (TTM). As such, figures may have altered significantly and provide an imperfect overview for investors’ requirements. In addition, different industries are associated with different P/CF levels.</p>
<p>The use of P/CF as a comparison tool should therefore be limited to comparing companies that offer similar products and services. As is often the case, the price to cash flow ratio should be used in conjunction with other methods of analysis so as to provide a true, more accurate overview of the company in question.</p>
<h3 id="price-to-free-cash-flow">Price to free cash flow</h3>
<p>A related ratio is the price to free cash flow ratio. Instead of cash flow, this calculation uses free cash flow. This is the cash that is available to benefit shareholders and is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from operating cash flow. The price to free cash flow ratio shows how much investors must pay for each £1 of free cash flow.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Current ratio and acid-test ratio]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>The ‘current ratio’ and ‘acid-test ratio’ are two financial ratios which are used to measure how easily a company could pay all its short term obligations, often referred to as current liabilities (mainly short term debt payments and accounts payable), with its short-term or current assets (cash, inventory and receivables).</p>
<h4 id="current-ratio">Current ratio</h4>
<p>The current ratio is also known as the ‘liquidity ratio’, ‘cash asset ratio’ or ‘cash ratio’. It is calculated as:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mtext>Current ratio</mtext>
<mo> = </mo>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mtext>Current assets</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>Current liabilities</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>For example, if ABC Company’s current assets are $100m and its current liabilities are $67m, the current ratio is 100,000,000 divided by 67,000,000 and equals 1.49 or 149%. Put simply, it means that the company has $1.49 of current assets for every dollar of current liabilities.</p>
<p>Obviously, the higher a company’s current ratio, the more able that company is to pay its short term obligations. Alternatively, if the current ratio is less than 1.0, the company may have problems meeting its obligations. However, what constitutes a suitable ratio varies from industry to industry.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you are going to use the current ratio to compare different companies (say, for investment purposes), you should only compare companies within the same industry. For example, in some industries a current ratio of 2.0 or more would be considered adequate, whereas in a different industry, that same ratio may be considered too high, suggesting that management is being overly cautious and not using its current assets efficiently.</p>
<p>Therefore, a current ratio should always be considered in the context of the company and its industry sector, the nature of the company’s assets, its cash flow and also its ability to borrow.</p>
<h4 id="acid-test-ratio">Acid-test ratio</h4>
<p>One problem with using the current ratio for analysing creditworthiness is that a company’s current assets usually include inventory, stock or other assets that sometimes cannot be sold quickly enough to realise their full value in time to meet the short-term obligations; or, if sold quickly, may have to be sold at a deep discount.</p>
<p>Therefore, to measure a company’s short term financial strength, analysts sometimes use a more stringent test known as the acid-test ratio, which excludes inventory from current assets to include only ‘quick’ (ie liquid or near-cash) assets. These would include readily marketable investments and short-term accounts receivable.</p>
<p>This ratio is used to measure a company’s capacity to maintain operations as normal using current cash or near cash reserves in bad periods. Interestingly, the name ‘acid-test’ comes from the Gold Rush days when gold miners would immerse their gold nuggets in acid to see if they were real gold since, unlike other metals, gold does not corrode or dissolve in acid.</p>
<p>The acid-test ratio is also known as the ‘quick assets ratio’ or ‘quick ratio’, and is calculated as:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mtext>Acid-test ratio</mtext>
<mo> = </mo>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mtext>Current assets</mtext>
<mo> – </mo>
<mtext>inventory</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>Current liabilities</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>Using our ABC Company example (with inventory of say $29m), the acid-test ratio would be 100,000,000 minus 29,000,000 divided by 67,000,000 to equal 1.06 or 106%. This figure means that, for every dollar of current liabilities, the company has $1.06 of easily convertible assets. Again, what would be considered an acceptable acid-test ratio will vary from industry to industry.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>There are two methods commonly used to measure the rate of return on an investment: yield to maturity and current yield.</p>
<h4 id="yield-to-maturity">Yield to maturity</h4>
<p>Yield to maturity (YTM) has many aliases – yield, redemption yield, gross redemption yield (GRY) and internal rate of return (IRR).  All refer to the total interest you receive from purchase to maturity of an investment, typically a bond, plus any gain or loss.</p>
<p>Calculating YTM involves the following equation.  It requires the identification, through trial and error, of ‘r’, which is the interest rate used to calculate the current value of future interest payments and the redemption payout.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>B = par value on maturity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>P = bond’s purchase price today.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, for a four-year bond, paying annual 3% coupons, with a price of £95 and par value of £100, the YTM would be 4.39%.</p>

<p>Due to the complexity of this equation it is usually worked out using specialist calculators or computer programmes.  The popularity of YTM lies in its ability to take into account the initial investment amount, the interest payments and the amount of interest earned on interest.  Since YTM calculates a bond’s total expected rate of return, investors can compare bonds with different coupon rates, maturities and credit qualities.  The disadvantages lie in its assumption of bond retention until maturity and re-investment of the interest/coupon payments at the same rate as the bond’s yield – in practice, this may not happen.</p>
<h4 id="current-yield">Current yield</h4>
<p>Also known as the running yield, flat yield or income yield, current yield is calculated by dividing the income received per annum (ie annual coupon or interest payments) by the purchase price of the investment, excluding any accrued interest.  Unlike the YTM measurement, it overlooks any capital gain, or loss, on redemption/sale.</p>
<p>Expressed as an equation, the current yield is:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mtext>CY</mtext>
<mo>=</mo>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul class="plain">
<li>
<p>CY = current yield expressed in %.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>R = coupon rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>P = purchase price of the investment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In relation to a four-year bond, purchased at £95, paying annual 3% coupons, the current yield would be 3.16%.</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mfenced>
<mfrac>

</figure>
<p>Current yield is a much more straightforward calculation than YTM.  However, drawbacks include the inability to take into account any potential capital appreciation or loss.  This calculation also overlooks any interest on interest received.  If a bond is purchased at a discount, the YTM will be greater than the current yield.  If it is purchased at a premium, on the other hand, the current yield will be greater.</p>
<h4 id="other-yields">Other yields</h4>
<p>Alternative yield measurements do exist but are less commonly used.  For example, the Japanese bond market uses the simple yield to maturity measurement.  This takes account of the capital gained or lost on the investment, but not the compound interest (that is the interest that can be earned on any interest received).</p>

		<title><![CDATA[EV/EBITDA]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>EV/EBITDA, also known as the enterprise multiple, is a ratio that is used to determine the value of a business compared to its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Unlike other valuation ratios, such as the price-earnings ratio (P/E ratio), its valuation includes the cost of paying off debt.</p>
<p>The formula is as follows:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mtext>Enterprise value </mtext>
<mfenced>
<mtext>EV</mtext>
</mfenced>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation </mtext>
<mfenced>
<mtext>EBITDA</mtext>
</mfenced>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>Therefore, if a company’s EV was €150m and its EBITDA was €15m, its EV/EBITDA would be expressed as 10x. This is because its EV is 10 times its EBITDA.</p>

<h5 id="enterprise-value-ev">Enterprise value (EV)</h5>
<p>Enterprise value is the value of the entire company to both shareholders and debtors. It is calculated using the following formula:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mtext>EV</mtext>
<mo>=</mo>
<mtext>Market cap</mtext>
<mfenced>
<mtext>italisation</mtext>
</mfenced>
<mo>+</mo>
<mtext>Net debt</mtext>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>The inclusion of net debt gives a more accurate valuation.</p>

<p>Since EV/EBITDA is usually used for the valuation of shares, it is generally assumed that the company’s debt is worth its market value (in the case of bonds) or its book value (for other forms of debt), which is the value shown in the company’s accounts.</p>
<h4 id="when-is-it-used">When is it used?</h4>
<p>EV/EBITDA is widely used and is particularly useful as a formula for comparing the value of different companies. It has advantages over similar ratios because its result is not affected by capital structure and the denominator is not affected by taxes. This makes it particularly useful for international comparisons. It is normally used instead of, or alongside, the P/E ratio.</p>
<p>EV/EBITDA is used by investors, who are primarily interested in cash flows and who are less interested in the non-cash factors that EV/EBITDA excludes: amortisation and depreciation. It can be calculated using forecast profits as an alternative to past figures.</p>
<h4 id="risks">Risks</h4>
<p>EV/EBITDA may not always present an accurate picture of a company’s value. In the 1990s, many young technology companies were able to boast of misleading EBITDA profits while suffering large pre-tax losses as a result of their rapidly depreciating technology assets, since depreciation is not taken into account in EBITDA.</p>
<p>It is important to ensure that the EV and the EBITDA are calculated for the same part of the business (ie either the whole group or one of its component companies); otherwise this will cause incorrect results. If correct figures cannot be found for the relevant part of the business then the formula will need to be adjusted to take this into account.</p>
<p>EV/EBITDA is less effective when used to compare the value of companies in different industries. This is because different industrial sectors often require companies to have different levels of capital expenditure.</p>

<p>In our second article on yield curves, we look at the purpose of a yield curve and the different situations in which it may be used.</p>
<h4 id="benchmarking">Benchmarking</h4>
<p>Higher-risk securities will pay more interest, which means they give a higher yield than those that involve less risk, such as government bonds. Investors can, therefore, use the yield curve of a relatively safe security as a benchmark for the increased return they might expect to receive on a riskier security. By comparing the two curves the additional yield for different periods can be compared.</p>
<h4 id="pricing-bonds-and-other-interest-bearing-securities">Pricing bonds and other interest bearing securities</h4>
<p>Forecasters can use interest rate forecasts to try and predict what will happen to yield curves in different scenarios. The value of interest bearing securities are determined by a number of factors, including the present value of their expected yields, so yield curves can be used by investors to identify which bonds may be comparatively cheaper than others and therefore represent good investment potential.</p>
<h4 id="maximising-returns">Maximising returns</h4>
<p>The shape and movement of the yield curve are used by investors to identify the optimum time to invest. This is referred to as ‘playing the yield curve’ or ‘riding the yield curve’. There are many strategies that investors follow when attempting to maximise returns on their yields; the following are two of the more common examples:</p>

<h5 id="diagram-1-barbell-strategy">Diagram 1: Barbell strategy</h5>

<a class="enlargeable" href="http://treasurytoday.com/i/2008/04/2008-04-ttc-07-cc-diagram-01-barbell-strategy.png"><img alt="Diagram 1: Barbell strategy" height="140" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/2008/04/2008-04-ttc-07-cc-diagram-01-barbell-strategy-t.png" width="300"/></a>
</figure>
<p>Investors use a barbell strategy for buying securities at extreme ends of the yield curve – short-term and long-term securities. This enables investors to make the most of attractive long-term interest rates, while hedging the risk with short-term securities in case the market takes a downturn. The return from the short-term securities is usually reinvested, again on a short-term basis, after maturity. The barbell strategy is usually most successful when the yield curve is flat.</p>
<figure class="center">

<h5 id="diagram-2-bullet-strategy">Diagram 2: Bullet strategy</h5>
</figcaption>
<a class="enlargeable" href="http://treasurytoday.com/i/2008/04/2008-04-ttc-07-cc-diagram-02-bullet-strategy.png"><img alt="Diagram 2: Bullet strategy" height="148" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/2008/04/2008-04-ttc-07-cc-diagram-02-bullet-strategy-t.png" width="300"/></a>
</figure>
<p>The bullet strategy is used to build a portfolio of securities that all mature at a given point on the yield curve. This is a useful strategy when investors know they will need the funds at a particular time, but want to stagger the investment to reduce the risk. This is usually more successful when the yield curve is rising steeply.</p>
<h4 id="forecasting-economic-conditions">Forecasting economic conditions</h4>
<p>Investors might also use yield curves as indicators of future economic trends. Since yield curves reflect market sentiment – and market sentiment can impact on the wider economy – they may indicate a tendency towards recession or an economic upturn.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>The earnings per share (EPS) calculation is used to gauge the value of a company’s stock by calculating the amount of the company’s net earnings that is allocated to each outstanding common share. The formula used to determine EPS is as follows:</p>
<figure>
<math>

<mtext>Dividends on preferred stock</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>Weighted average of outstanding common shares</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>For instance, if a company’s net income was €40m, it paid out €2m in dividends on preferred stock and the weighted average number of its outstanding common shares was 20m, the formula for working out its EPS would be:</p>

<h4 id="a-few-definitions">A few definitions</h4>
<h5 id="outstanding-shares">Outstanding shares</h5>
<p>Outstanding shares are those owned by members of the public and investors, as well as restricted shares owned by individual members of the company. Outstanding shares do not include shares that have been repurchased by the company itself.</p>
<h5 id="preferred-stock">Preferred stock</h5>
<p>Preferred stock often entails restricted voting rights for its holder and pays out a fixed amount in dividends. Preferred stock is subtracted from the net income because it takes precedence over common stock. Therefore, if the dividends on preferred stock total €2m, that money will not be available for common stock.</p>
<h5 id="weighted-average">Weighted average</h5>
<p>Weighted average is used to incorporate any changes in the number of shares over the period in question. For instance, if our company had 16m stocks in the first half of the year and increased that number to 24m in the second half, the weighted average would be worked out thus:</p>

<h4 id="variations">Variations</h4>
<p>The above EPS calculation is a basic version. It is possible to adapt the calculation to take into account common stock plus all its equivalents, such as convertible bonds and warrants, by adding these to the denominator. In this case the formula is referred to as ‘fully diluted’.</p>
<p>There are also different forms of EPS depending on the time period used: trailing (using past figures), current (using this year’s figures) and forward (using projected figures).</p>
<h4 id="when-is-eps-used">When is EPS used?</h4>
<p>EPS is useful when comparing different companies’ shares to assess their relative values and is used in the Price Earnings to Growth (PEG) ratio which is used to reveal the market value of a share’s growth potential. Basic EPS is also widely used in the US, where the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) requires companies to report it on their income statements. Companies with complex capital structures must report both basic and diluted EPS.</p>
<h4 id="a-word-of-warning">A word of warning</h4>
<p>EPS is best used as one of the measures of the value of a company’s stock. It is not possible to use it to get an exact valuation because other relevant factors are excluded. Most importantly it does not take the market value of the stock into account and its use is therefore limited.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>In this article, the first in a series on yield curves, we introduce the basic concept of a yield curve, looking at what a yield curve is and how it usually appears.</p>


<h4 class="fn">Hantai Qin</h4>
<h5 class="title">Treasury Manager – Asia-Pacific Region</h5>
<img alt="Jabil" class="logo org" height="15" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/jabil-logo-2009-90x15.png" width="90"/>

<p>Headquartered in Florida in the USA, Jabil is a leading EMS (electronic manufacturing services) company, providing electronics design, production and product management to electronics and technology companies worldwide. Jabil has more than ten legal entities in China and is also active in India, Malaysia, Singapore, Japan, Vietnam and Taiwan.</p>


<h2 id="problem">Problem…</h2>
<p>In 2006, Jabil made the decision to adopt an electronic banking solution as part of a wider restructuring of cash management in Asia. The company was making a large number of payments – several thousand each month – but without a centralised solution for managing cash, this was time consuming and inefficient.</p>
<p>A regional cash management solution was needed to streamline the payment processing and transaction reporting, provide greater visibility over payments and at the same time optimise liquidity. It was also hoped that the chosen solution would enhance control and risk management and assist with compliance with regulatory requirements such as Sarbanes-Oxley.</p>


<h2 id="solved">…Solved</h2>
<p>Jabil invited ten international banks to put forward their solutions in October 2006. Following an extensive selection process, the solution offered by Citi was chosen. The decision was based on Citi’s wide branch network across Asia as well as the merits of the technically advanced Citibank File Exchange (CFX) solution compared to other e-banking solutions on offer.</p>
<p>Citi’s solution comprised two components, CitiDirect and CFX. The first of these, CitiDirect, is Citi’s electronic banking system. “CitiDirect gives us a global point of view,” explains Qin. “It enables the treasury people to see all the bank account movements across Asia, so this is where we can get the real time information.” CitiDirect also allows Jabil to standardise processes, automate report generation and manage reconciliation and reporting needs through a single platform.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The good thing is that the local people know the local regulations and concerns, while Citi’s Asia people can focus on the big overview to solve all the problems and co-ordinate the project.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CFX, meanwhile, provides a seamless connection at the local level. It enables straight through processing for files created by SAP by translating files generated by Jabil’s ERP system and acting as a gateway for host-to-host connectivity. “This has made payments easier than in the past,” says Qin. “For example, when the payment day comes we can easily run a payment report because this is a seamless connection. Then we will generate an SAP IDoc file, the file can be automatically transferred to Citi’s back office, and then they can make the payment. In this case, I think the whole process is more productive, and can save a lot of workload.” CFX also offers industry standard security software and the solution is compliant with Sarbanes-Oxley.</p>
<p>Citi was appointed in March 2007 and the implementation team was set up in May. “The first country chosen was Malaysia, since this is where Jabil’s SAP team and main manufacturing plant are located. As it was the start of a regional process, implementation took a few months due to file development and testing,” says Qin. “With Malaysia now live, adding new countries will be a simple process of around two months each, on the basis of the same infrastructure. The solution is scheduled to be in place in China around July this year.”</p>
<p>Qin is enthusiastic about the success of the solution and the level of service provided by Citi. “They have local knowledge throughout Asia; they also have one contact point based in Singapore, leading the whole implementation. The good thing is that the local people know the local regulations and concerns, while the Asia people can focus on the big overview to solve all the problems and co-ordinate the project.” He also expects Citi’s solution to provide additional benefits as the cash management project continues to develop. “CFX is a multi-bank solution and in the future this could be a big plus in terms of managing cash in other banks.”</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Return on Total Assets]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Return on Total Assets (ROTA), sometimes also referred to as Return on Assets (ROA), is a measure of how effectively a company uses its assets.  It depicts the amount earned per unit of investment in assets and demonstrates how efficiently a company has employed its assets to generate returns.  ROTA, expressed as a percentage, is calculated as follows:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mtext>ROTA</mtext>
<mo>=</mo>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mtext>Net income</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>Total Assets</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>In accounting terms it is calculated by dividing net income by average total assets.  This is a better measure if there is a significant change in assets during the period under review.</p>
<p>The advantage of using ROTA as compared to ROE (Return on Equity) is that it also takes liabilities into account as the total assets figure is used regardless of whether they are financed by equity or debt.  The credit rating agencies usually prefer ROTA over other measures when evaluating the profitability of a company.</p>
<h4 id="rota-and-operation-performance">ROTA and operational performance</h4>
<p>A second method of calculating ROTA attempts to assess operational performance, rather than financial performance.  Instead of using net income, the net profit before interest and taxes is compared to the assets that were employed to achieve this result.  Using earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) helps to eliminate the impact of non-operational items on the net income.</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mtext>ROTA</mtext>
<mo>=</mo>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mtext>Earning before interest and taxes</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>Total Assets</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>ROTA calculated with the above formula can be used to compare the performance of companies which have different costs of borrowing as well as companies that are subject to different tax regimes.  The higher the ROTA, the more earnings a company is making relative to its investment.  As some industries are more capital intensive than others, the ROTA figures of companies in different industries can vary widely.  Thus, it is important to compare ROTA values either of the same company over time or of similar companies over the same time period.</p>
<p>The divisions of a company will vary in terms of the assets deployed to carry out the business and ROTA is a good measure for comparing the performance of different divisions.  As ROTA calculated using EBIT is unaffected by the financing structure it also makes more sense to use this measure to evaluate the relative performance of different divisions as the management of business divisions is typically not involved in financing decisions.</p>
<h4 id="rota-and-sales">ROTA and sales</h4>
<p>Another way of calculating ROTA is to multiply the Return on Sales with the asset turnover.  Asset turnover measures the sales turnover produced by the use of the assets.  This produces the same result by using two other measures of financial performance.</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>

<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mtext>Sales</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>Total Assets</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>The formula shows that management can influence ROTA by improving either the profit margin or the asset turnover.  The profit margin may be improved by reducing costs or increasing revenues by price increases).  Similarly, a reduction in the level of inventory or accounts receivable reduces working capital and increases ROTA.  This ROTA formula may also reveal whether the company in question is a high profit margin, low volume or low profit margin, high volume producer.  The disadvantage of this method is that sales may not be the best indicator of efficiency in every company.</p>
<p>ROTA is also used by companies internally to make investment decisions by estimating the potential change in the ratio under different investment options.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[The Altman Z-Score]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>The Z-score model was developed by Edward Altman in 1968 to predict the likelihood of a company’s bankruptcy. Instead of relying on a single performance or liquidity ratio the NYU professor chose five financial ratios and assigned a specific weighting to each individual one. The weightings were derived from an initial data sample based on 66 manufacturing companies.</p>
<p>The sum of all five ratios multiplied by their individual weightings results in a single value, the Z-score, which indicates whether a company may be facing financial difficulties in the near future.</p>
<p>Altman created different models for private and public companies which are distinguished solely by different risk weightings. The Z-score formula for public companies is:</p>

<p>The lower the Z-score, the more likely it is that a company may face bankruptcy. According to Altman, a score above 3 would be the sign of a financially healthy company, making bankruptcy very unlikely. Any score below 1.8, on the other hand, would represent a very high probability of failure. Any values between 1.8 and 3 are difficult to interpret either way, but lower values may indicate an increased risk of business failure.</p>
<p>The Z-score is a surprisingly reliable indicator of corporate bankruptcy. In independent studies of actual bankruptcies, the Z-score model would have predicted between 72 and 80% of corporate bankruptcies two years in advance. One year prior to the bankruptcy the accuracy of the Z-score model increased up to 90%.</p>
<h4 id="the-ratios-used-by-the-z-score-model">The ratios used by the Z-score model</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The working capital to total assets ratio measures a company’s liquid assets in relation to its size. It gives an indication of a company’s ability to cover short-term financial obligations. Negative working capital (total current assets – total current liabilities) would imply that a company is likely to have difficulties servicing its short-term debt as there are insufficient assets to cover any obligations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retained earnings to total assets (RE/TA) shows a company’s ability to accumulate earnings by using its total assets. Companies with low RE/TA are financing their operations through debt rather than retained earnings. Companies with a high RE/TA, on the other hand, may be more capable of withstanding a bad financial year. A consistently high RE/TA is often closely related to a firm’s age and maturity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to total assets measures the productivity of a company’s assets. Similar to the return on assets (ROA), it illustrates how well a company uses its assets to generate earnings and recognises that earnings are a key factor for the financial stability of a company’s operations in the long-term.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sales to total assets ratio indicates how the company uses its assets to generate sales. It can indicate management’s capacity in dealing with competitive conditions, as, for example, a low market share would be reflected by a low asset turnover.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The market value of equity to total liabilities gives an assessment of how much the value of a firm exceeds its liabilities. It introduces an element of market confidence in the company into the formula, implying that financial weaknesses would be recognised by the market and be reflected in the share price.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="shortcomings-of-the-model">Shortcomings of the model</h4>
<p>Despite the relative accuracy of the model, it has several weaknesses. In particular, young companies with little or no earnings will often have a low Z-score without necessarily facing bankruptcy. The Z-score may also be quite volatile, as it can be affected by accounting elements such as write-offs. Finally the sales to assets ratio will vary between industries, and less capital-intensive non-manufacturing companies in particular may have slightly higher Z-scores as a result of the asset turnover ratio.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the Z-score can be a valuable tool for investors or accountants as it flags when a more thorough analysis of a company’s finances may be required.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Discounted cash flow]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Discounted cash flow (DCF) is a valuation method used to assess the potential of capital or security investments. It can also be used to value a particular project or an entire company. The idea behind discounted cash flow is that the present value is based on the sum of all future cash flows, adjusted for the time value of money.</p>
<p>This adjustment is made to recognise that a cash flow that will be received in the future has a lower present value. Therefore future cash flows are discounted to their present value by applying a discount rate. The discount rate typically has two components: an adjustment for inflation and a risk-adjusted return for the use of the money.</p>
<p>When deciding whether to make a specific investment the discount rate can be considered as the minimum required rate of return. Companies would normally use their own average cost of capital (debt and equity) as the discount rate, as only an investment that exceeds the cost of capital would add value to the company.</p>
<p>In order to calculate the net present value of an investment or a project, the following steps need to be taken:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Identify the size and timing of the expected future cash flows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine the discount rate or the required rate of return for the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calculate the present value of the cash flows using an equation such as this one:</p>

<p>For example, a company has a required rate of return (r) of 8% and considers investing in a new business venture. The initial outlay for the project will be €140,000. Annual running costs are estimated at €60,000 and cash inflows are expected to be €100,000, resulting in a net annual cash flow of €40,000 (after taxes). No further cash flows are expected after five years, when the project will be phased out. Using the DCF formula, the net present value (NPV) of the project can be calculated as the sum of all cash flows discounted to their present value less the initial outlay.</p>

<p>As the NPV is positive the company should consider the investment. In theory, any investment with a positive NPV should be made. However, as funds are limited, companies would choose the investments or projects they want to pursue by employing an NPV index. This index is calculated by dividing the NPV of each investment or project by the initial cash outlay. A higher index will then indicate a more advantageous investment opportunity.</p>
<p>There are many variations used in DCF calculations, which all serve the purpose of estimating the cash flows that will be received from an investment adjusted for the time value of money. The main difficulties in using DCF are estimating the size and timing of future cash flows, determining the most appropriate discount rate and projecting how the discount rate is going to change over time. The calculation also takes no account of the certainty of the anticipated cash flows.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>The Standardised Corporate Environment (SCORE) is the newest access model for corporates from messaging network SWIFT. It is intended as the next evolutionary step on from the previous access model, the Member-Administered Closed User Group (MA-CUG). After a three-month trial with companies including Microsoft and GE, SCORE went live in January 2007. Since then 30 banks and 15 corporates have joined the service.</p>
<h3 id="why-score">Why SCORE?</h3>
<p>In the past, corporates and non-financial institutions have had limited access to the SWIFT network. MA-CUGs were introduced by SWIFT in 2001 and allowed corporates to communicate securely with their banks over SWIFTNet. However, adoption levels were affected by the fact that corporates needed to join each of their bank’s MA-CUGs – one MA-CUG for each bank communicated with. This proved time-consuming and costly.</p>
<p>The introduction of SCORE is a progression from MA-CUGs, bringing more advantages for corporates and their banks. SCORE allows corporates to communicate with all SWIFT member banks through a connection to a single closed user group. This reduces the connectivity costs formerly associated with MA-CUGs. As communications between corporates and their banks become more streamlined, liquidity management can also be improved due to the fact information from transactions with several banks can be received quickly and viewed in a standardised format, helping corporates assess their liquidity more effectively.</p>
<h3 id="services">Services</h3>
<p>SCORE offers corporates access to a number of services including SWIFTNet FIN, SWIFT’s messaging service with message validation to ensure messages are properly formatted. FileAct, the file transfer system, is also available under the new access model and can be used in real-time or store and forward mode. Under SCORE, FileAct is able to support transfer payments data in bulk in non-SWIFT formats. However, the services provided to corporates remain the responsibility of each bank – so a service provided by one bank may not be provided by another.</p>
<h3 id="restrictions">Restrictions</h3>
<p>SWIFT regulations state that companies hoping to sign up to SCORE must be listed on a regulated stock exchange in a Financial Action Task Force (FATF) country. The stipulation of membership to the FATF, an inter-government organisation which develops and promotes international legislation to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, is to help SCORE maintain a high level of security. However, the exclusion of privately held companies not listed on a regulated stock exchange lowers the numbers of corporates who are eligible.</p>
<p>Corporates will also have to consider hardware and software costs for connection to SWIFT’s SCORE network. Costs arise from subscription fees and data volume charges for FileAct and transactional volume charges for FIN messaging. SCORE may prove more beneficial to larger companies with high messaging and transactions volumes. Companies with more modest volumes will have to weigh up the costs and the benefits of joining.</p>
<p>As more corporates join SWIFT, the number of available services will increase. However, corporate–tocorporate and bank-to-bank communications will remain prohibited.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>SWIFT has come a long way in allowing corporate access. MA-CUGs went some way towards addressing the problem and SCORE goes further still. However, SWIFT continues to approach the question of corporate access with caution, and the restrictions imposed on corporates wishing to join SCORE are likely to remain in place for a while longer.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Price Earnings to Growth ratio (PEG ratio)]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>The price earnings to growth ratio (PEG ratio) attempts to determine a share’s value by taking into account the company’s earnings growth. It gives a potential indication as to how the market values the share’s growth potential in relation to the earnings per share (EPS) growth. The formula used to calculate the PEG ratio is as follows:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mi>P</mi>
<mo>/</mo>
<mtext>E ratio</mtext>
<mo>= </mo>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mtext>Price</mtext>
<mo>/</mo>
<mtext>Earnings Ratio</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>Annual EPS Growth</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>For example the PEG ratio for a company that has a PE ratio of 15 and an annual earnings growth rate of 10% would be 1.5.</p>
<p>The PE ratio compares a company’s share price to its earnings per share (EPS). The PEG ratio in turn compares this PE ratio to the projected EPS growth rate. Assuming that the stock market correctly priced a share by taking into account a company’s future growth, a PEG ratio of 1 would indicate that the share’s anticipated EPS growth is fully reflected in the current share value as expressed in its PE ratio.</p>
<p>Similarly to the PE ratio, interpretations of the PEG ratio can vary. A PEG ratio greater than 1 could mean that a share is overvalued, but it could also mean that investors are willing to pay a higher share price because they expect fast growth in the future.</p>
<p>Likewise PEG ratios of under 1 may indicate that a share is undervalued and the market does not expect the company to meet its earnings forecasts; or that the market has not recognised and correctly priced the share relative to the company’s earnings growth potential.</p>
<p>Therefore, the PEG ratio must be used in conjunction with other indicators and ratios to give a more complete picture of a share’s value. In particular the company’s fundamentals, business strategy and the drivers of EPS growth must be evaluated to put the PEG ratio in perspective. At the same time a company’s PE and PEG ratio should be compared to their historic values and to the PE and PEG ratios of other companies from the same industry.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that the PEG ratio is a mere rule of thumb and not based on mathematical relationship, as it compares a fraction (PE ratio) to a percentage (EPS growth). The underlying mathematical basis becomes particularly questionable for companies that have low or no earnings growth.</p>
<p>For these companies the PEG ratio leads to results that cannot be deemed a fair price. However, the PEG ratio gives a good indication of the growth/price trade-off of shares with fast growing earnings. In practice, it is therefore only used for companies that display at least average growth rates.</p>
<p>When comparing different PEG ratios the assumptions underlying EPS growth forecasts also need to be considered. Firstly, due to their predictive nature these may be quite inaccurate. Secondly, different timeframes for the forecasts from one to several years may be used. Ideally the earnings forecasts should be based on sustainable growth estimate over several years, but frequently earnings estimates for the following year, and in some cases even the trailing EPS growth, are used.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>The price-earnings ratio values a share by comparing a company’s share price to its per-share earnings. It is used to measure the relative cost of a share as it illustrates how much money the investor has to pay for each €1 of the company’s earnings.</p>
<p>The price-earnings ratio (P/E ratio), which is also sometimes known as ‘price multiple’ or ‘earnings multiple’, is calculated by dividing the current market value per share by the earnings per share (EPS):</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mi>P</mi>
<mo>/</mo>
<mtext>E ratio</mtext>
<mo>= </mo>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mtext>Share price</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>Earnings per share (EPS)</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>While the current market value of the share is its currently quoted share price, earnings per share are calculated by dividing the annual net income by the number of shares outstanding.</p>
<p>For example, if a company’s share is currently trading at €45 and earnings for the last 12 months equate to €5 per share, it will result in a P/E ratio of 9.</p>
<p>In other words, the investor had to pay €9 per share for every €1 of the company’s per share earnings.</p>
<h3 id="interpretation">Interpretation</h3>
<p>However, there are different ways to interpret what the P/E actually means. The share price of a company will not only include historic information but also future expectations. This means that the P/E ratio can also be interpreted as a reflection of market expectations for the company’s growth prospects.</p>
<p>In this sense, a high P/E would indicate that investors expect higher earnings growth in the future. Eventually the company will have to increase earnings to justify the high and rather expensive ratio or the share price will fall. Conversely, a low P/E may represent a lack of investor confidence in the share or simply a share that is undervalued.</p>
<p>It is important to remember though, that P/E ratios differ between industries. When P/E ratios are compared, it should be between companies of the same industry, the industry average or the company’s past P/E values.</p>
<p>The difficulty in interpreting the P/E is not due to the complexity of the share price alone. As the denominator of earnings per share is based on an accounting measure of earnings, the figure may be open to manipulation. In addition, there are different types of P/E ratio in use.</p>
<p>Typically, the P/E is calculated by using earnings per share (EPS) from the last 12 months, which is then known as the trailing P/E. The projected P/E is based on estimated EPS for the next 12 months. A third variation uses a mixture of historic EPS (last two quarters) and estimated EPS (following two quarters). Earnings estimations are of course, not necessarily correct and the reliability of the P/E is only as good as the underlying earnings projections.</p>
<p>Because the P/E ratio is open to many interpretations, it should be used in conjunction with other indicators, such as the company’s history of generating earnings and how predictions for future growth fit into this picture. As part of a bigger picture, the P/E ratio is a much more reliable indicator of relative cost than the share price and the trend of the share price on its own.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Kelly formula]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>The Kelly formula and its derivations are employed in money management systems to define the optimum amount that should be invested and risked in a series of repeated trades that have a positive expectation. The aim of the formula is to maximise the long-term growth rate of funds based on the probability and size of the potential gain as well as the size of the potential losses.</p>
<p>The formula was originally developed in 1956 by John Kelly, a researcher for the telecommunications company AT&amp;T, to find a solution to the problem of random interference (noise) on long-distance telephone lines. The Kelly formula ultimately helped to reduce information loss and increase data flow in telephone communication.</p>
<p>In his paper ‘A new interpretation of information rate’, Kelly compared information theory to the problem of a gambler who has inside information on a horse race. Subsequently, the formula was used by sports bettors and investors to determine the optimum percentage of a maximum amount that should be invested and risked in a bet or investment.</p>
<p>The formula requires the estimated percentage of wins (W%) and the win/loss ratio dividing the average size of wins (W) by the average size of losses (L).</p>

<p>For example, if the probability of winning is 70%, the average win is 60 and the average loss is 30, the optimum amount that should be risked is 55%.</p>

</figure>
<p>This means that in this scenario, risking 55% of total funds would provide the maximum rate of return. In essence, the formula states that the higher the risk (ie the lower the winning probability), the lower the percentage of total funds that should be invested and vice versa. While investors instinctively know this, the Kelly formula provides a calculation of the amount that should be risked.</p>
<h3 id="problems">Problems</h3>
<p>There is however a major problem with the Kelly formula. In our example, risking 55% of funds in a series of trades that have a positive expectation of 70%, could still result in a sequence of losing trades that will diminish funds significantly before they can increase. While the formula will guarantee that not all funds can be lost in a series of trades, risking the amount that maximises the return can still lead to very volatile results.</p>
<p>For practical purposes, the Kelly formula is therefore often lowered by 20 – 50% in order to reduce volatility. For the same reason it is suggested never to risk more than 25% of total funds.</p>
<p>Another problem with the Kelly formula is that its assumptions are not directly applicable to the investment world. The formula considers only two possible outcomes, total win and total loss, whereas a typical investment can yield a range of returns. It is also very difficult to determine the exact probability of making a positive investment.</p>
<p>However, the formula can still be put to use in a money management system. The probability of winning can, for example, be calculated as the number of investments returning a positive yield divided by the number of total investments. The win/loss ratio can be calculated as the average size of positive returns divided by the average size of negative returns. When these numbers are put into the Kelly formula, the resulting percentage can give a good indication of the size of future positions to take in similar trades in order to maximise total returns.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>The cost of debt is the average interest rate that a company pays on all of its debt. It calculates the costs associated with each individual form of debt, for example of loans and bonds, and determines the average cost for the entire debt of the company.</p>
<p>The cost of debt is typically expressed after tax, as interest payments on debt are tax deductible and this will reduce the overall cost of borrowing. There are two general approaches to determine the cost of debt:</p>

<h5 id="debt-securities">Debt securities</h5>
<p>The cost of debt represents the opportunity cost of debt and what a company would have to pay on its debt if it was raising funds today. This means for debt securities that it is not the existing coupon on bonds and debentures, but the rate that the company would need to pay new purchasers of the security. A corporate bond’s current yield to maturity is the best approximation for the cost of debt capital:</p>

<p>For example, a ten year bond paying a 6% coupon with a face value of €1,000 is currently selling at €950 with eight years until maturity. Using the formula above, the yield to maturity and the cost of debt before tax is 6.79%:</p>

<h5 id="bank-loans">Bank loans</h5>
<p>In contrast to securitised debt, bank borrowings do not have a market price that can be related to the cost of debt. The interest rate of an existing loan can simply be taken as an approximation of the cost of debt.</p>
<h3 id="2-using-the-debt-risk-premium-method-to-estimate-the-cost-of-debt">2. Using the ‘debt risk premium’ method to estimate the cost of debt</h3>
<p>This method estimates the cost of debt. According to the debt risk premium method, the cost of debt is the sum of a risk free rate and a risk premium for the risk of the company in question. Using this method, the risk free rate of a government bond, which matches the term structure of the corporate debt, would be used. Then, depending on the company’s credit rating, the appropriate risk spread would be derived from currently traded comparable bonds from the issuer with a similar credit rating and features. The sum of the risk-free rate and the risk premium is the estimated cost of debt.</p>
<h4 id="after-tax-cost-of-debt">After-tax cost of debt</h4>
<p>To arrive at the after-tax cost of debt, the following formula can be used:</p>

<p>Taking the example from above where the cost of debt on a bond is 6.79% and the applicable tax rate is 30%, the company’s after-tax cost of debt for the bond would be 4.753% (6.79% × (1-30%)).</p>

		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>A company’s cost of equity can be seen as the equity investor’s required return on equity. There are two commonly used methods for calculating the cost of equity: the dividend capitalisation model and the capital asset pricing model.</p>
<h3 id="dividend-capitalisation-model">Dividend capitalisation model</h3>
<p>The expected return from a share can be broken down into dividend yield and capital appreciation. Proponents of dividend growth models argue that only future cash dividends can give a reliable estimate of a share’s value and effectively replace an estimate of capital appreciation with the predicted growth rate of dividend payments.</p>
<p>As these individual payments are difficult to predict in the long term, the constant growth model assumes that dividends grow at a constant rate in perpetuity. The dividend capitalisation model estimates the cost of equity by adding together dividend yield and the expected growth in dividends using the following formula:</p>
<figure>

<mtext>Growth rate of dividends</mtext>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>However, the dividend model cannot be employed for companies that do not pay a dividend, nor is it able to handle variable dividend growth rates.</p>
<h3 id="capital-asset-pricing-model">Capital asset pricing model</h3>
<p>The CAPM is nowadays more widely used than the dividend model. It is based on the theory of a relationship between the risk of an asset, in this case the company’s equity, and the expected rate of return that is required by investors on the asset.</p>
<p>According to the formula the opportunity cost of equity capital is equal to the return on a risk-free asset plus a combination of market risk and a company’s individual risk (beta):</p>

</ul>
<p>The CAPM assumes that investors expect two types of return. Firstly, any investment must yield a return that is at least equal to what could be earned by investing into a risk-free asset. This return represents the time value of money that is generated by investing into any type of investment without considering the risks taken. Generally, a long-term government bond can be used as a reference for the risk-free rate.</p>
<p>In addition, the investor expects a premium as compensation for any risks that are taken compared to the riskfree asset. In the CAPM these additional risks are composed of the risk of investing into the stock market instead of any other market (market risk) and the risk that is associated with an individual company’s share.</p>
<p>The market risk premium can be derived from historical data referencing the difference between stock market returns and risk-free rates

</math>. This difference tends to be relatively stable in the long term.</p>
<p>The individual risk of a company’s share is expressed as beta. Beta measures the volatility of the share in comparison to the general stock market movement. A beta of 1, for example, means that the share is expected to move in line with movements in the stock market as a whole. A beta higher than 1 signals a share that is relatively more volatile than the index and therefore slightly riskier than the market in general. For example, a beta of 1.5 indicates that a 1% change of the index rate would result in a 1.5% change in the share value.</p>
<p>It is important to recognise that CAPM has significant problems. Some studies have found that the beta factor alone cannot be used reliably to forecast the return of a share. Nevertheless, due to the lack of a practical substitute and because of its ease of use, the CAPM remains widely employed to determine the cost of equity.</p>

<p>Last month, we looked at how a basic coupon paying bond structure is priced. This month, we explain how to price a bond that has no coupon.</p>
<p>Instead of paying regular interest, a zero-coupon bond yields a return by selling at a discount to its face value which is paid out at maturity. In order to calculate its price, we have to determine the present value of its par value at maturity. This present value – or the difference between the cost now and the principal value at maturity – is the interest earned. If we assume this is compounded semiannually at a required yield we can calculate the price of the bond.</p>
<p>The formula to use is simple:</p>

<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p>An investor wants to purchase a zero-coupon bond with a face value of €1,000. The bond matures in five years and the investor seeks a required yield of 8% per year.</p>
<p>Typically the required yield of zero-coupon bonds is based on two annual interest payments in the same way interest would be paid on an interest bearing bond. This means that the required yield of 8% per year has to be divided by 2, resulting in 4% for every six months. At the same time, the number of interest periods has to be doubled from five years to ten half-year periods.</p>
<p>Using the formula above, the investor would be willing to pay not more than:</p>

<p>Zero-coupon bonds tend to be long-term investments with a maturity of 10 years or longer. The longer the maturity, the higher the discount on the face value of the zero-coupon bond will be.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of coupon payments, zero-coupon bonds yield no current income, which may deter some investors. However, long-term financial needs in particular can be met with this type of bond. The large discount means that compared to coupon paying bonds, less capital is needed upfront from the investor.</p>
<p>Like any other bond, the price of a zero-coupon bond rises when interest rates fall and falls when interest rates rise. The value of a zero-coupon bond relies solely on the difference between purchasing price and face value. As a result, the price of a zero-coupon bond reacts with much more volatility to interest rate changes than the price of a regular coupon paying bond. In other words, duration is shorter for interest bearing bonds than zero-coupon bonds which have a duration that is equal to maturity. Zero-coupon bonds also effectively lock-in the reinvestment rate and are therefore particularly attractive to investors when interest rates fall.</p>
<p>One issue that US investors may have with zero-coupon bonds is that unless the bond is tax exempt or held in a tax-deferred account, tax on the imputed interest that accrues each year has to be paid annually, even though the interest gain is only realised at maturity.</p>

<p>A bond needs to offer a specific yield or rate of return in order to attract investors. Interest rate changes will have an effect on the price of a bond. If interest rates rise, the value of a bond will go down and its price will drop, and vice versa.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that if current interest rates are higher than the coupon payments of a bond, investors will need an incentive to invest into an instrument that pays lower interest than alternative investments. As coupon payments are fixed, the bond will have to sell at a discount.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, coupon payments are higher than prevailing interest rates, investors would be willing to pay a premium on the face value of the bond. Therefore the yield on a bond needs to be at least equal to current prevailing interest rates.</p>
<p>In general, the price of a bond is the sum of the present values of all cash flows during the life of the bond, including all coupon payments and the payment of the face value at maturity. These known future cash flows are discounted to their present value to determine the bond’s price:</p>

<p>This formula has as an underlying assumption that the first coupon will occur in one interval. For example, if a bond pays in six-month intervals, the first payment will be made six months from now.</p>
<p>As an example, in order to calculate the price of a simple plain vanilla bond, with a face value of €1,000, a maturity of 8 years, a coupon payment of 8% and a required yield of 9%, we need to determine:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>The number of coupon payments.</h5>
<p>As the bond will pay the coupon twice a year and the first coupon payment is six months away, the bond will pay 16 coupons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>The value of each coupon payment.</h5>
<p>As the bond pays a coupon twice a year, the annual coupon rate of 8% must be divided by 2. The resulting 4% of €1,000 gives us €40 per coupon payment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>The required yield per coupon payment.</h5>
<p>Again we have to divide the required yield per annum by the number of coupon payments in a year (2), which results in 4.5%.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>When a loan is provided with discounted interest, the borrower receives the principal at the beginning of the loan period minus the interest that the principal would otherwise accrue during the loan period.  This method may apply to certain types of financial instruments, such as bills of exchange.  For example, if you were to borrow £100 for one year at a discount rate of 4%, you would receive £96 at the outset and after a year, you would repay £100.</p>
<p>However, as the borrower will receive £96 instead of £100, the true interest rate on the loan will be higher than the discount rate.  The true interest rate can be calculated using the present value formula:</p>

<p>Therefore the true interest cost of this particular investment is 4.17%.</p>
<p>The concept of discounting can also be used to determine the present value of a sum that is expected in the future.  For example, if you know that you will receive £500 in two years’ time, and the annual interest rate is 5%, you can calculate the present value of this sum using:</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>

<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a form of technical analysis that calculates the price strength of a security by comparing its consecutive end of day share prices. The RSI is a momentum indicator that measures the speed at which a security’s price is changing. High RSI values of over 70 on a scale of 0 to 100 often indicate overbought shares, whereas RSI values of lower than 30 often indicate oversold shares. RSI is therefore used to identify trading entry and exit points.</p>
<p>The RSI is calculated as follows. For each trading day both the upwards (<math>

<p>The RSI result is a number between 0 and 100. Investors use the RSI to look for bullish or bearish signals. In an RSI chart, the RSI oscillates around a centreline of 50. Any value above 50 indicates that average gains are higher than average losses, whereas a value of below 50 signals that average losses outweigh average gains.</p>
<p>Often RSI values of 70 and 30 are used to indicate overbought or oversold shares, so that a share falling below 70 is seen as a sign for falling share price trend in the future and a share rising above 30 is regarded as a bullish signal. Some traders will look for extreme RSI values in combination with corresponding longterm trends.</p>
<p>Other investors will look for a divergence between the share price development and the RSI curve to identify potential entry or exit points.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Return on Total Assets (ROTA)]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Return on Total Assets (ROTA), sometimes also referred to as Return on Assets (ROA), is a measure of how effectively a company uses its assets. A company employs its assets (ie anything the company owns) to produce future economic benefit (ie profit). By comparing the input, in terms of total assets, to the output in terms of profits, ROTA provides a measure of the profitability of a company. There are three main methods of calculating ROTA, which is expressed as a percentage.</p>
<p>The first method is to divide net income by total assets:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mtext>ROTA</mtext>
<mo>=</mo>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mtext>Net Income</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>Total Assets</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
<mo>×</mo>
<mn>100</mn>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>While this will work well in most cases, a second way of calculating ROTA attempts to assess operational performance, rather than financial performance. Instead of using net income, it compares the net profit before interest and taxes, elements which are non-operational, to the assets that were employed to achieve this result. Therefore the pre-tax ROTA can be used to compare companies with different financing strategies as well as companies that are subject to different tax regimes.</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mtext>ROTA</mtext>
<mo>=</mo>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mtext>Earnings before Interest and Taxes</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>Total Assets</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
<mo>×</mo>
<mn>100</mn>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>The higher the ROTA, the more profit a company makes relative to its investment. As some industries are more capital intensive than others, ROTA figures of companies in different industries can vary widely. Thus, it is important to compare ROTA values either of the same company over time, or of similar companies over the same time period.</p>
<p>ROTA can also be used to measure the performance and profitability of different business divisions. This is because pre-tax ROTA measures the profits against the assets that a division uses and hence gives a good indication of the profitability and effectiveness of each division. The fact that pre-tax ROTA is unaffected by the financing structure, such as the debt/equity mix or the costs of financing, is also advantageous for this kind of use, as the management of business divisions is typically not involved in these types of decisions.</p>
<p>A third way of calculating ROTA focuses on the effects that the operating cycle has on the profitability of a company. It multiplies the Return on Sales with the asset turnover.</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mtext>ROTA</mtext>
<mo>=</mo>
<mtext>Return on Sales</mtext>
<mo>×</mo>
<mtext>Asset Turnover</mtext>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mtext>EBIT</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>Sales</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
<mo>×</mo>

<mrow>
<mtext>Sales</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>Total Assets</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
<mo>×</mo>
<mn>100</mn>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>The asset turnover is the company’s sales in relation to the total assets used to generate these sales. The higher the number the better. The formula shows that operational management can influence ROTA by improving either the profit margin, for example due to increased revenue or lower cost, or the asset turnover. In companies that have a high share of inventories or accounts receivable the management of these particular assets, for example the reduction of inventory, can effectively increase ROTA. The ROTA formula may also reveal whether the company in question is a high profit margin low volume or low profit margin high volume producer.</p>
<p>However, the disadvantage of this method is that sales may not be not the best indicator of efficiency in every company. In addition, the assets used by ROTA are only the assets figuring on the balance sheet, making it difficult to compare companies with varying degrees of intangible assets. If the ROTA of different companies are compared, the companies should be similar in terms of capital intensity and the use of intangible assets.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is a measure of the performance of a business unit or of an entire company. Investors use the ratio to assess the quality of company returns. ROIC is an important ratio because, more significantly than profit margins or simple growth figures, it computes how much cash can be produced for a given cash investment. ROIC makes no distinction between equity shareholders and lenders for the cash-on-cash return, and effectively measures how much value a company’s operations actually create.</p>
<p>The simple equation for ROIC is:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mtext>Net Income After Tax</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>Invested Capital</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>The difficulty in calculating ROIC is that it requires several adjustments to be made from the financial statements, all of which aim to represent the company’s operations more effectively. Some companies may receive income from sources other than their operations, for example investment income. Therefore net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) is often used instead of net income after tax.</p>
<h3 id="nopat">NOPAT</h3>
<p>While for some companies NOPAT may be equivalent to the net income after tax, other companies may need to make adjustments to exclude investment and interest income, while including the tax paid on these items. The tax shield from interest expenses must be subtracted and goodwill amortisation and nonrecurring costs may or may not be added, depending on the method used.</p>
<p>We start with earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) or, if this is not reported, with earnings before taxes, and add back any interest expenses, because it is necessary to capture the profits that accrue to all capital holders including lenders. Amortisation of goodwill is also added if goodwill is included in depreciation charges of revenue/net sales.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that depending on the company and method used, more complex adjustments – which are beyond the scope of this article – can be made for operating leases, inventory accounting etc. to convert accrual into a more cash-based profit figure.</p>
<p>Operating taxes need to be subtracted from this figure to give us net operating profits after taxes:</p>
<figure>
<math>

<mtext>Tax Rate</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfenced>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<h3 id="invested-capital">Invested Capital</h3>
<p>The invested capital is calculated as total assets less excess cash, less non-interest-bearing current liabilities. Cash is deducted as it is not invested in the business. Non-interest bearing current liabilities (NIBCL) is a type of debt that must be paid within one year, but which does not require interest payments, for example accounts payable or deferred taxes. As NIBCL represents a free source of credit which ultimately enhances returns, it should be reflected in ROIC. NIBCL are therefore deducted from total assets.</p>
<p>This gives us the following equation:</p>

</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<h4 id="roic-wacc-spread">ROIC-WACC spread</h4>
<p>ROIC in itself is not able to give any indication as to whether a company’s operations are creating sufficient value. In order to give a proper assessment, the return on the invested capital has to be compared to the cost of capital. ROIC is compared to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Only if ROIC exceeds WACC, and the so-called ROICC-WACC spread measured is positive, have the company’s operations generated value from the invested capital.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Return on Equity (ROE) is a measure of a company’s profitability. It is calculated as:</p>
<figure>
<math>

<mrow>
<mtext>Net Income</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>Shareholder’s Equity</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>

</figure>
<p>In practice, ROE is one of the basic ratios used by investors to compare the profitability of a company either to that of peer companies or to the industry average for the same time period. The idea behind this profitability ratio is that companies with a high ROE will be able to use shareholder equity more efficiently to generate profits and thus provide a higher return on investment.</p>
<p>All components of the ratio can easily be identified. While net income features in a company’s income statement, shareholders’ equity is part of the balance sheet.</p>
<p>If we use the financial data released by Ford Motor Co. for 2005, for example, the ROE for the year would be:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mfrac>
<mrow>

<mn>0.1562</mn>
<mtext> or </mtext>
<mn>15.62</mn>
<mo>%</mo>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>If we compare this to another car maker’s figures for the same year, such as DaimlerChrysler, we will see that despite DaimlerChrysler’s higher net income ($2.8 billion compared to $2.0 billion), its ROE is lower as a result of a much larger total shareholder equity ($36.4 billion compared to $12.9 billion):</p>
<figure>

<mtext> or </mtext>
<mn>7.8</mn>
<mo>%</mo>
<mtext>ROE</mtext>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>These calculations show that Ford’s ROE of 15.6% is twice as high as DaimlerChrysler’s 7.8%. At first glance, this would indicate that Ford has a much greater ability to use the investments made by shareholders to generate earnings. However, there is a fundamental problem with ROE in that the ratio’s denominator – total shareholders’ equity or average common equity – represents the total of a company’s assets less its total liabilities. This means that ROE does not take the company’s liabilities into consideration. In other words, how much borrowing does the company have? This is called gearing or leverage. The question that needs to be asked is: how highly geared or how highly leveraged is the company?</p>
<p>If a company funds expansion by raising debt instead of issuing equity, the net income might rise as a result, but shareholder equity will stay the same and thus lead to a higher ROE, providing the additional return exceeds the interest cost of the increased borrowing. Hence, a high level of debt can inflate ROE.</p>
<p>In order to take liabilities into consideration, other ratios, for example Return on Assets (ROA), can be used. ROA puts the net income in relation to the company’s total assets (regardless of how it is funded). If we again use the example of the two automobile manufacturers:</p>
<p>Ford’s ROA is calculated as:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mfrac>

<mo>$</mo>
<mn>2,024</mn>

<mtext> or </mtext>
<mn>0.75</mn>

</figure>
<p>Whereas DaimlerChrysler’s equivalent ROA is:</p>
<figure>

<mtext> or </mtext>
<mn>1.4</mn>
<mo>%</mo>
<mtext>ROA</mtext>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>Even though DaimlerChrysler has a considerably lower ROE than Ford, its ROA of 1.4% is nearly double the amount of Ford’s 0.75% ROA. This can be explained by the different levels of debt and liabilities that the companies carry on their balance sheets. DaimlerChrysler’s total liabilities of $165 billion are significantly lower than Ford’s at $255 billion.</p>
<p>Hence, to use ROE effectively, it is important to also consider the level of debt a company has. But for a company with little or no excess debt, the ROE ratio is a good indicator of the company’s ability to grow.</p>

<mn>1</mn>
</mrow>
</math> being an investment which can no longer be recovered (and close to 8 representing a very good investment!). To express this calculation as a percentage, simply multiply the result by 100.</p>
<p>However, establishing the relationship between ROIs calculated using the above equation is not particularly straightforward. For instance, an investment which yields an ROI of 0.2 one year and depreciates by the same amount the following year (ie -0.2) would yield -0.04 overall, rather than the 0 which may be apparent at first glance. This is because the relationship between <math>
<mrow>

<mi><sub>f</sub></mi>
</mrow>
</math> and <math>
<mrow>
<mi>V</mi>
<mi><sub>i</sub></mi>
</mrow>
</math> described by the above equation is not linear – the variable <math>
<mrow>

</mrow>
</math> is not independent of the variable <math>
<mrow>
<mi>V</mi>
<mi><sub>i</sub></mi>

</math>.</p>
<p>This confusion can be remedied by applying logarithms to the ROI calculation, thus ROI can also be expressed as:</p>

<mrow>
<mo>-</mo>
<mo>∞</mo>
<mo>→</mo>
<mo>∞</mo>
</mrow>
</math>. By allowing an equal range of expression on either side of 0, the logarithmic ROI calculation is balanced and symmetrical. Thus ROIs can be directly compared.</p>
<p>The concept of ROI is used for many other applications outside the purely financial expression outlined above. For example, IT and Human Resources departments often talk about the ROI of a new technology or training methodology they plan to implement.</p>
<aside>
<p>Next issue we look at how to calculate <a href="/2006/06/return-on-equity-roe">Return on Equity (ROE)</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>The method used to calculate ROI will vary according to the situation to which it is applied. Whilst the basic principle of comparing the net benefits of an investment to the original investment will always apply, other factors will also be incorporated into the equation. For instance, an IT department looking to calculate the ROI of purchasing and implementing a new system would need to incorporate the depreciation in value of any new technology purchased (new technology is generally deemed obsolete after three years of use) in such an ROI assessment as well as estimates of the benefits of time saved.</p>

<p>For investments made over longer periods, it is normal for coupons or interest payments to be paid. These payments can themselves be invested for the remaining term of the investment. This ‘compounds’ the return. So while the proceeds of this investment are strictly only from these coupons or interest payments, the reinvestment of the monies received produces an additional return which is calculated as follows:</p>

<p>This calculation has assumed an annual interest payment, but it can also be used for more frequent payments. For example, if the interest is paid half-yearly, the interest rate becomes 1.5% (3% per annum, paid over half a year) and n becomes 20, giving us the answer: €134.69. This enables the additional benefit of more frequent interest payments to be estimated.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Any investment which accrues interest is composed of two parts:</p>
<h5>Principal</h5>
<p>– the original investment.</p>
<h5>Interest</h5>
<p>– the interest which accrues on the original investment. How often the interest accrues, and how and when the interest is paid, will vary according to the exact terms of the investment.</p>
<p>There are two types of interest:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Simple interest is simply the amount paid to the investor for the investment, usually expressed as a percentage of the amount invested. This takes account of the interest that is earned on the principal investment only. It ignores the value of any interest paid during the term of the investment.</p>
</li>
<aside class="definition">
<p>In a compound interest calculation it is assumed that the interest paid can be re-invested at the same rate as is being paid on the investment.</p>
</aside>
<li>
<p>Compound interest includes the value of interest paid during the term of the investment. It takes account of interest that can be earned on any interest which is paid during the investment period. Therefore the total amount on which interest is calculated and paid increases over time. This process – known as compounding – is important when comparing interest rates which are applied frequently (say monthly) with a rate that is applied less frequently (say annually).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="calculation-of-interest">Calculation of interest</h3>
<p>To illustrate the difference between simple and compound interest we will consider an investment of RMB 1,000,000 over a year at an interest rate of 3% per annum.</p>
<p>To calculate simple interest, use the formula:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><math>
<mrow>
<mi>r</mi>
</mrow>
</math> = annual interest rate</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So the total return would be:</p>

<mn>1,030,000</mn>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>This compound interest calculation would produce the same result if all the interest was paid at the end of the year. However, if the interest was paid monthly and added to the investment during the year, the total return should be calculated using the formula:</p>
<figure>
<math>

</li>
<li>
<p><math>
<mrow>
<mi>n</mi>
</mrow>
</math> = number of interest payments during the year</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If interest was paid monthly the total return would be:</p>

<mn>1,030,416</mn>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>So the compound interest would be RMB 30,416.</p>
<p>While these differences are small as a proportion of the whole sum, they will become much more significant for larger investments and longer periods. It is therefore vital to understand how interest is calculated and paid when comparing interest rates. This also applies to all forms of borrowing.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>A bank or public holiday is a holiday approved by the State. Traditionally, public holidays are celebrations of significant national, cultural, or religious events. Banks and other businesses are generally closed for the duration of a public holiday and therefore transactions cannot be settled in the country/currency in question on these days. For example, spot FX transactions, which take two business days to clear, will take a day longer if this period includes a public holiday in the country of one of the traded currencies. It is useful to be aware of when in the year public holidays fall and that different countries have different public holidays. Knowledge of the dates and reasons for different countries’ public holidays can give you an insight into the national character. Below is a table detailing the public holidays for a selection of countries and regions.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Short-term fixed deposits are useful when companies have excess cash to invest for a limited period. For example, a seasonal business with high sales levels at one time of year may have excess cash for a short period before it stocks up for the next big sales period. Other companies may maintain a cash surplus as a contingency for unforeseen events. In either case, the company will want to maximise the return on its surplus cash in the meantime.</p>
<p>Many investors want to calculate the interest that will be earned in order to calculate the exact amount to be received on maturity. Assuming that all of the interest is paid at the end of the period, this can be done using the following formula, which calculates the total return on a short-term deposit:</p>

</aside>
<p>The exact period of the deposit is important if an accurate calculation is to be made. For example, a three month period may be anything from 89 to 93 days – depending on when weekends and bank holidays occur. This includes non-banking days for the country in which the deposit is taken and also the country of the currency being invested. The number of days considered to be in a year also varies according to the currency, as some currencies assume a 360 day year and other currencies a 365 day year.</p>
<p>Let us look at a worked example. Consider a sum of $100,000 invested at an annual interest rate of 3% for three months (92 days) – on the basis of a 360 day year.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Last month, we explained how to calculate a series of zero-coupon rates from a number of coupon-paying bonds with different maturities – using a technique called ‘bootstrapping’. We calculated the zerocoupon rates for two and three year bonds. Data for a four year bond have been added to this table and a yield curve has been drawn.</p>

</figure>
<h4 id="challenges-to-be-overcome">Challenges to be overcome</h4>
<p>Despite the ‘bootstrapping’ technique being straightforward and applicable to a variety of different instruments, in real-life it can be difficult to calculate a complete yield curve using this technique. This is due to three main reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Availability of instruments.</h5>
<p>In our illustration, we have assumed that instruments with the desired maturities are available to create a full yield curve. In practice, it can be difficult to identify instruments with these maturities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Drawing curves can be difficult.</h5>
<p>As a result, investors need to draw a yield curve on the basis of the instruments which are available. They can calculate a series of interim points, but there may not be a clear and smooth relationship between those points. This makes calculating the exact shape of the yield curve more difficult.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Market imperfections.</h5>
<p>This method assumes the bonds are priced accurately in the market. Despite prices being more transparent these days, there is still likely to be a difference between the prices and yields on different instruments.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>

<p>Continuing our series on yield curves, this month we explain how to construct a zero-coupon yield curve. We consider two-year and three-year maturities.</p>
<p>Next month we will conclude our series on yield curves by demonstrating  how the resulting calculations are graphically represented.</p>
<p>Zero-coupon yield curves can actually be constructed from a series of coupon-paying bonds. This is  a technique known as ‘bootstrapping’. For example, consider the following bonds which pay annual  coupons and have a maturity of two and three years respectively.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<h4 id="two-year-maturity">Two year maturity</h4>
<p>The investor will pay 98.435 for the first bond, to receive 5 (the coupon) in one year and 105 (the  coupon and repayment at par) at the end of two years.</p>
<p>In order to calculate the equivalent zero-coupon bond structure, we take the 98.435 that the investor  pays to purchase the bond and assume the investor borrows 4.717 to offset the interim coupon  payment – to make this calculation you need the one-year interest rate and we have assumed a oneyear  rate of 6%. So the net cash outflow is 93.718.</p>
<p>At the end of the first year, the investor will use the interim coupon payment to repay the borrowing  of 4.717, which with interest has become 5. At the end of the second year, the investor will receive  105.</p>
<p>This allows us to identify the two-year zero-coupon rate. This is the rate which discounts 105 to  93.718. To calculate this, we use the following formula:</p>

<!--nextpage-->
<h4 id="three-year-maturity">Three year maturity</h4>
<p>We can also use this information to calculate a three-year zero-coupon rate. In this case, we need to  construct an artificial zero-coupon bond, by identifying how much the investor would need to  borrow to offset the payment of the two interim coupons of 4.</p>
<p>By using the one-year rate of 6%, we can calculate the investor would need to borrow 3.774 today to  match the coupon of 4 in one year.</p>
<p>We also need to calculate how much the investor would need to borrow today, to match the  anticipated two-year coupon receipt of another 4. For this, we use the two-year rate which will be  the same as the zero-coupon rate we calculated earlier – 5.848%.</p>
<p>The two-year discount factor is

<mn>0.8926</mn>
</mrow>
</math> Using this, we can calculate that the investor  would need to borrow 3.570 today to receive 4 in two years.</p>
<p>In order to calculate the zero-coupon rate, we assume the investor purchases the bond for 96.784  and borrows 7.344 to compensate for the two interim interest payments. The investor’s initial outlay  is therefore 89.440.</p>
<p>Using the same formula as outlined above

<mo>–</mo>
<mn>1</mn>
</mrow>
</math>, we can then identify the three-year zerocoupon  rate. In other words, the rate which discounts 104 to 89.440.</p>
<p>In this case:</p>

<p>So the three-year zero-coupon rate is 5.156%</p>
<p>Using the different zero-coupon rates we have calculated, it is then possible to create a series of  zero-coupon yields and then construct the yield curve.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>In previous issues, we explained the purpose of yield curves and looked at different yield measurements – the main ones being yield to maturity (YTM) and current yield. This month we explore different bases for yield curves.</p>
<p>There are a number of different bases on which to construct the graph of a yield curve. The four main ones are yield, forward rate, par yield and zero coupon yield. These use different bond profiles to construct the expected term structure from which the yield curve is drawn.</p>
<h4 id="yield-curve-ytm-curve">1. Yield curve (YTM curve)</h4>
<p>The yield to maturity curve (often referred to simply as the yield curve) is the most common type of yield curve. This uses the yield to maturity (YTM) measurement examined in June’s Calculator Corner and is subject to the same limitations. The yield curve demonstrates the link between the returns (yields) and maturity dates for a group of instruments with the same risk. A typical example is a yield curve constructed from yields on treasury bills of different maturities issued by a government.</p>
<h4 id="forward-rate-curve">2. Forward rate curve</h4>
<p>The forward rate curve (also referred to as the forward rate) is based on the aforementioned standard yield curve. It is a graph of the forward rates implied by the yield curve. This recognises that interest rates will vary at different times during the period. Indeed, the forward rate curve illustrates the forward interest rates for each period shown on the yield curve. This curve is used to illustrate the prices of interest rate derivative instruments.</p>
<h4 id="par-yield-curve">3. Par yield curve</h4>
<p>Ideally, the yield curve is built using the yield to maturity of a coupon-bearing instrument (eg bond) whose market price is par. By choosing bonds trading at par, the investor can eliminate the distortion caused by the different coupon rates payable on differently priced bonds. The yield on a par bond is the same as the market rate. Lower coupon bonds will sell at a discount to compensate the investor for taking a below market coupon yield. Similarly, an investor will have to pay more for a bond with a coupon that is set at above current market rates. In either case, this distorts the yield curve on similar risk instruments.</p>
<p>Since bonds pay different coupon rates, it is rare for many to be trading at par. Therefore it can be difficult to find bonds from which to construct a par yield curve.</p>
<h4 id="zero-coupon-yield-curve">4. Zero coupon yield curve</h4>
<aside>
<h5 id="next-month">Next month</h5>
<p>Next month we will explain how to <a href="/2005/10/constructing-a-zero-coupon-yield-curve">construct a zero coupon yield curve</a> by giving a worked example of the zero coupon rate formula.</p>
</aside>
<p>This is perhaps the most straightforward of yield curves to build. A zero coupon instrument is one which does not pay any interest (coupon) over the course of the term. Instead, the holder of the instrument (eg bond) is rewarded with a repayment of principal at maturity. Despite not earning any interest, investors gain from paying a discounted principal amount. Thus, all the yield is in the form of a capital gain.</p>
<p>Since there is only one payment, calculating the yield from its price (which is of course its net present value) is relatively simple. The advantage is that, in calculating the yield, the investor does not have to assume a reinvestment rate for any of the interim coupon payments associated with couponbearing bonds.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Last month we looked at yield to maturity (YTM) as a way of measuring yields. This month we look at the other main yield measurement – the current yield.</p>
<h4 id="current-yield">Current Yield</h4>
<p>The current yield measurement is also known as the running yield, flat yield and income yield. It is calculated by dividing the income received per annum (ie annual coupon of interest payments) by the purchase price of the investment excluding any accrued interest. Therefore, unlike the YTM measurement, it does not take into account any capital gained or lost on redemption/sale.</p>
<p>Expressed as an equation, the current yield is: 
<math>
<mrow>
<mtext>CY</mtext>
<mo>=</mo>
<mfenced>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mi>R</mi>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mi>P</mi>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mfenced>
<mo>*</mo>
<mn>100</mn>
</mrow>
</math></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul class="plain">
<li>
<p>
<math>
<mrow>
<mtext>CY</mtext>
</mrow>
</math> = current yield expressed in %.</p>
</li>

</math> = coupon rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<math>
<mrow>
<mi>P</mi>
</mrow>
</math> = purchase price of the investment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, if we use the same parameters as last month’s example:</p>
<p>A four-year bond, purchased at £95, paying annual 3% coupons would have a current yield of 3.16%.</p>

</figure>
<p>The main advantage of the current yield calculation measurement is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is more straightforward than the formula for YTM we explained last month.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The disadvantages of this measurement are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It does not take into account any potential capital appreciation or loss</p>

<h4 id="ytm-v-current-yield">YTM v Current Yield</h4>
<p>Apart from the associated advantages and disadvantages, there are two important factors which should be taken into account if deciding whether to use YTM or the current yield to calculate returns on investment:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the bond is purchased at a discount, the yield to maturity will generate more than the current yield.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, if the bond is purchased at a premium, the current yield will realise more.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="other-yields">Other Yields</h4>

<p>Next month, continuing our series on yield curves, we look at <a href="/2005/09/the-yield-curve-part-v-types-of-yield-curve">types of yield curve</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>Other yield measurements do exist, but are not as commonly used as the YTM and current yield measurements. For example, the Japanese bond market uses the simple yield to maturity measurement. This yield takes account of the capital gained or lost on the investment, but does not take into account compound interest, ie interest on interest.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>So far we have looked at what a yield curve is, its different shapes and how it is used. This month we begin our review of yield measurements – of which there are several. The principal ones are yield to maturity and current yield. Here we examine the former.</p>
<h3 id="yield-to-maturity">Yield to maturity</h3>
<p>The yield to maturity (YTM) measure has many aliases – yield, redemption yield, gross redemption yield (GRY) and internal rate of return (IRR). All refer to the total return you receive by holding an investment, typically a bond, until it matures. In other words, YTM equals the interest you receive from the time you purchase an investment until maturity, plus any gain or loss. It is the most commonly used measure to value bonds – thus in our example of YTM below, we refer to a bond.</p>
<p>Calculating YTM involves the following complex equation. It requires the identification, through trial and error, of ‘r’, which is the interest rate used to calculate the current value of future interest payments and the redemption payout. Thankfully, some calculators (e.g. HP12C) and programs (e.g. Microsoft Excel) have a built-in function to carry out the calculation.</p>

<p>Investors prefer to analyse bonds by YTM because it takes account of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The initial investment amount, i.e. the bond’s purchase price, which gives any appreciation or depreciation in the bond’s price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The interest payments, i.e. the coupon payments.</p>

<p>Since YTM calculates a bond’s total expected rate of return, investors can compare bonds with different coupon rates, different maturities and different credit qualities.</p>
<p>The disadvantages of this measurement are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It assumes the investor retains the bond until maturity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It assumes the investor can reinvest the interest/coupon payments at the same rate – in practice, this may not happen.</p>

</ul>

		<title><![CDATA[The yield curve part II – the purpose of a yield curve]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Last month we introduced the concept of a yield curve, looking at its various shapes. Part II in our series on the yield curve, explores its purpose and explains what is meant by ‘playing the yield curve’. Further articles in this series will discuss different ways to measure and construct yield curves.</p>
<h3 id="using-a-yield-curve-with-different-securities">Using a yield curve with different securities</h3>
<p>As we explained last month, yield curves are used to illustrate the yields obtained from an investment for specific maturity dates. Examples of these could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Interest paid on deposits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Swaps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Money market securities of various forms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bonds (including Government, Treasury or Corporate bonds notes and loan stock).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="uses-of-a-yield-curve">Uses of a yield curve</h3>
<p>The yield curve has a number of uses, particularly in relation to valuation. These uses can be identified as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Providing a benchmark for valuation.</h5>
<p>Most fixed-income securities (e.g. corporate bonds) involve some form of risk. Investors can use the expected yields from a minimal-risk security (e.g. Government bond) as a benchmark for the potential yields they may gain from a riskier security (e.g. corporate bond). In principle, the greater the risk, the greater the yield.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Identifying when bonds are cheap or expensive.</h5>
<p>Bond prices are determined by a number of factors, including the current value of their expected yields. By comparing various interest-rate forecasts, investors can produce different yield curve scenarios and try to identify the various values for each. This will enable them to establish which particular bonds are – according to their assumptions – cheap and thus represent good investment potential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Identifying when returns on bonds can be maximised.</h5>
<p>Investors can use the shape and any movement in yield curves to identify the optimum time period to invest. This is commonly referred to as ‘playing the yield curve’ or ‘riding the yield curve’.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two main ways to attempt to realise above-average yields. Both relate to the spacing of the bonds’ maturities:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Bullet strategy.</h5>
<p>This is where an investor builds a portfolio of securities with maturity dates concentrated at one point on the yield curve (e.g. ten years). This maturity date is not necessarily the same as the time period for which the funds are available for investment. This is usually more successful when the yield curve is steep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Barbell strategy.</h5>
<p>This is where an investor builds a portfolio of securities with maturity dates set at two extremes on the yield curve (e.g. five and twenty years). This is usually more successful when the yield curve is flat.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course other strategies relating to bond investment also exist. Examples include staggered maturities, matched maturities and the ladder strategy. The last is where an investor builds a bond portfolio with comparable investment amounts spread evenly across different maturity dates. However, all these strategies focus on reducing the interest-rate risk, rather than maximising the yield, as exemplified above. The final use for yield curves is more general:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Indicating future economic conditions.</h5>
<p>Some investors use yield curves as economic predictors. The yield curve reflects market sentiment and may help investors anticipate either a recession or an economic upturn.</p>
</li>
</ul>

		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>In the first of a series of articles about ‘yield curves’, this month’s Calculator Corner introduces the concept. In forthcoming months, we will look at its purpose – how treasurers ‘play the yield curve’, explain how it is measured and explore the different ways to construct a yield curve.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-yield-curve">What is a yield curve?</h3>
<p>A ‘yield curve’ is the line on a graph showing the yields (i.e. the return) from an investment over time. By plotting the yields over different time periods, a yield curve is produced. A yield curve is based on the interest rates paid for different periods. Since short and longer term rates are different, the yield curve provides an illustration of how rates vary over time.</p>
<h3 id="different-maturity-dates">Different maturity dates</h3>
<p>A yield curve will cover a range of maturities – perhaps overnight, one week, one month, three months, six months and one year or more. Whilst, for longer-dated instruments, a range of maturities from one to as much as twenty five years might be taken.</p>
<p>In most cases, the yield available on a longer maturity (eg one year or more) will be higher than a shorter dated investment (eg a period of weeks or months). In other words, a premium is paid by the investor for the longer maturity. However, investors may be expecting interest rates to fall, in which case the shorter date may pay a higher yield. This contributes to the shape of the yield curve.</p>
<h3 id="the-shape-of-a-yield-curve">The shape of a yield curve</h3>
<p>Yield curves vary in shape depending on three factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Future interest rate expectations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Risk premiums on the underlying investment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The convexity bias – how the slope of the curve changes over time in relation to other interest rates (a complex subject to which we will return in the future!).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-main-types-of-yield-curves-are">The main types of yield curves are:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Normal (positive) yield curve</h5>
<p>Where long-term investments have higher yields than shortterm ones. This is the most typical scenario in developed countries.</p>
<p>In some circumstances, a positive yield curve may be very steep. If the curve does rise sharply, this is usually associated with an economic upturn post-recession.</p>

</figure>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Inverted (negative) yield curve</h5>
<p>Where the long-term yield is less than the short-term yield. This indicates an expected decline in interest rates.</p>

</figure>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Flat (even) yield curve</h5>
<p>Where the yield is the same for short-term and long-term debt securities (eg bonds). This is an unusual scenario and can suggest an economic slowdown. A flat yield curve often precedes a change from a positive to an inverted yield curve (or vice versa).</p>

<p>The value of the option is the difference between the spot foreign exchange rate and the strike price, discounted to a net present value. The spot rate is discounted using the foreign currency interest rate. This calculates the net present value of buying foreign currency at the current spot rate on expiration day. The strike price is discounted using the domestic interest rate. This is because the strike price is fixed in local currency when the option contract is agreed.</p>
<p>The principle of the currency option valuation can be seen by looking at the value of the option on expiration day. If the strike price is above the spot exchange rate, the transaction will be processed at the spot rate, meaning the value of the option is zero. If the spot price is above the strike price, the option will be exercised. The value of the option is the difference between what was paid (by exercising the option) and the cost of exercising the transaction at the spot rate.</p>

<p>The Black-Scholes model values options as the difference between the present value of the stock on expiration day and the present value of exercising the option on expiration day. There is more detail on the derivation of the model in Treasury Today October 2004, December 2004 and January 2005.</p>
<p>In Treasury Today November 2004, we identified the main assumptions of the model. One of the assumptions is that the option is European-style. This means that the option can only be exercised on expiration day.</p>
<p>The problem with this assumption is that it undervalues American-style options, which can be exercised at any time up to expiration date. Likewise, it undervalues exchange-traded options which can be resold at any point up to expiration.</p>
<p>By comparing two options, one European and one American, otherwise with the same terms, it is clear that the American style option is of higher value to the holder. This is because it offers the holder more opportunity to exercise the option.</p>
<p>Although there is no strict formula to value an American-style option, it is possible to identify an approximate value by employing one of the following techniques:</p>
<h4 id="a-basic-approach">A basic approach</h4>
<p>The simplest method is to value the American-style option as the higher of the option’s European value and its intrinsic value.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The European value is calculated using the model we explained in recent issues and will give the option’s value were it to be exercised on expiration day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The intrinsic value (the stock price minus the option strike price) will be positive as long as the option is ‘in-the-money’. The intrinsic value equals the value of the option if it is exercised today.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach computes the value of an option which can be exercised on two dates – today or on expiration day. Where there is still some time until expiration, it does not give a value to the holder (of an American-style option) of having the opportunity to exercise the option between today and expiration day.</p>
<h4 id="a-quadratic-approximation-method">A quadratic approximation method</h4>
<p>An alternative method is to use a quadratic approximation method developed by Barone-Adesi and Whaley. This defines the value of an American call option as follows:</p>

<p>

<p>
<math>
<mrow>
<mi>Q</mi>
</mrow>
</math> is a quadratic equation providing an approximation of the value of the early exercise option.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The quadratic equation is solved using an iterative process. It requires significant computational power and is beyond the scope of this article.</p>

<p>The value of an option depends on the likelihood of the option being exercised. In other words, it depends on the likelihood that the stock price will be higher than the strike price on expiration day. This depends on the volatility of the price and is shown in components 
<math>

</mrow>
</math> and 
<math>
<mrow>

<p>There are four determinants of 
<math>
<mrow>
<mi>d</mi>
<mn><sub>1</sub></mn>
</mrow>
</math>, which gives a measure of the volatility of the stock price:</p>
<ol>

<p>The ratio of the current stock price to the strike price (<math>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mi>P</mi>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mi>K</mi>

		<math>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mi>P</mi>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mi>K</mi>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</math>, the more the chance the option will be exercised. As a relative value, this provides a good indication of the likelihood of the option being exercised.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The risk-free interest rate (<math>
<mrow>
<mi>r</mi>
</mrow>
</math>). One of the weaknesses of the Black-Scholes model is the assumption that there is a risk-free rate, which can be calculated. In practice this assumption is unrealistic as interest rates change and there is no single risk-free rate. But, a risk-free rate must be assumed so the model can compute the time value of money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The historic volatility of the stock price (<math>
<mrow>
<mo>σ</mo>
<mn><sup>2</sup></mn>
</mrow>
</math>). The more volatile the price of the underlying instrument, the higher the value (and the cost) of the option will be. This is because the harder it is to predict the future value of the stock, the more volatile the underlying stock price. Again, the danger here is that it is impossible to predict future stock prices and thus volatility. This means the volatility is based on historic observation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The time to expiration (<math>
<mrow>
<mi>T</mi>
</mrow>
</math>). The longer until expiration, the more uncertain the stock price on expiration day. In other words, the closer it is to expiration day, the easier it will be to predict the stock price on that day. In addition, the closer the option is to expiration, the less important the time value of money is in the calculation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The second component 
<math>
<mrow>
<mi>d</mi>
<mn><sub>2</sub></mn>
</mrow>
</math> is a function of the same determinants as 
<math>
<mrow>
<mi>d</mi>
<mn><sub>1</sub></mn>
</mrow>
</math> and gives a measure of the volatility of the time value of the strike price.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>In October 2004 we explained the Black-Scholes Model for valuing options as the difference between the present values of the stock on expiration day (the first part of the equation) and of exercising the option on expiration day (the second part of the equation).</p>
<p>The value of a call option (<math>
<mrow>
<mi>C</mi>

<p>In November 2004, we outlined the main assumptions underpinning the model. In this article, we analyse Black-Scholes in more detail.</p>
<p>On expiration day, the value of the option is equal to the current stock price minus the option strike price. Symbolically:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mi>C</mi>
<mo>=</mo>
<mi>P</mi>
<mo>-</mo>
<mi>K</mi>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>This shows that if the stock price is above the strike price on expiration day, the option will be exercised and the value to the holder is the difference between the two prices. On the other hand, if the stock price on expiration day is equal to or below the strike price, the option will not be exercised and the value of the option is zero. This is the intrinsic value of the option.</p>
<p>Because prices vary over time, we also have to consider the time value of the option. In our basic equation, the current stock price (<math>
<mrow>
<mi>P</mi>
</mrow>
</math>) varies over time, meaning it does not have to be adjusted in the equation. However, because the option strike price (<math>
<mrow>
<mi>K</mi>
</mrow>
</math>) is fixed, we need to adjust this to take account of time.</p>
<aside>
<h5 id="next-month">Next month</h5>
<p>We will examine the role of <a href="/2005/01/volatility-in-black-scholes">volatility in Black-Scholes</a> next month.</p>

<p>This is done by multiplying the strike price by 
<math>
<mrow>
<mi>e</mi>
<mo><sup>-</sup></mo>

</mrow>
</math>. Black-Scholes assumes a constant risk-free interest rate, 
<math>
<mrow>
<mi>r</mi>
</mrow>
</math>, where no dividend is payable, which is continuously compounded over the time to expiration (<math>
<mrow>
<mi>T</mi>

</math>). <math>
<mrow>
<mi>K</mi>
<mo>*</mo>
<mi>e</mi>
<mo><sup>-</sup></mo>
<mtext><sup>rT</sup></mtext>
</mrow>
</math> is the present value of the strike price. This represents the amount the writer of the option will have to invest today (at the risk-free rate) to meet its obligation on expiration day, if the option is exercised. Symbolically:</p>

<p>Finally, the value of the option will be greater, the more volatile the underlying instrument (in this case the stock price). Future volatility cannot be calculated, so this is based on historic data and is represented by components

		<title><![CDATA[Assumptions of Black-Scholes]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>In last month’s issue of Treasury Today, we looked at the basic structure of the Black-Scholes model. This shows that the value of the call option on a stock is a function of the present values of both purchasing the stock outright and paying the exercise price on the day the option expires.</p>
<p>This is a very important model underpinning calculations valuing not just ‘plain vanilla’ options, but also barriers, compounds and other ‘exotic’ options. However, it is based on a number of assumptions, which must be understood.</p>
<p>There are five main assumptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>A European-style option is modelled.</h5>
<p>A European-style option can only be exercised on the day of expiration. The alternative, American-style option can be exercised at any point up to the day of expiration. In practice, American-style options tend to be exercised close to expiration as otherwise the holder will lose the time value of the option (see Finance A to Z, Treasury Today October 2004). The exception is if the holder purchases an American call option because it is unsure when it will need to exercise. Because of the restrictions on the exercise of European-style option, Americanstyle options will usually be more expensive. However, because of the uncertainty over the date of exercise, there is no model to value American-style options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>The stock pays no dividends during the life of the option.</h5>
<p>This is relatively easy to overcome as any such dividends can be discounted to a present value and subtracted from the present value of the stock.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Stock markets are efficient.</h5>
<p>There are a number of aspects to this:</p>
<ol class="alpha">
<li>
<h5>There is continuous trading.</h5>
<p>This allows investors to continuously revalue their portfolios.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>There is no scope for arbitrage.</h5>
<p>As a result of the constant revaluation, the market is assumed to be in equilibrium, such that the price of an option is always the difference between the present values of purchasing the stock outright and paying the exercise price on the day the option expires.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Market participants cannot predict future prices either of individual stocks or of the market as a whole.</h5>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h5>No commissions are charged.</h5>
<p>In reality, small commissions are charged on every transaction. The size of these commissions will vary according to the nature of the investor and therefore will further distort the effect of the model.</p>
</li>
<aside>
<h5 id="next-month">Next month</h5>
<p>In next month’s issue, we will examine how these assumptions are used in the <a href="/2004/12/explaining-black-scholes">Black-Scholes model</a>.</p>
</aside>
<li>
<h5>The model uses a constant risk-free interest rate to discount future prices to a present value and volatility is assumed to be constant.</h5>
<p>Although models often use the discount rate on US Treasury Bills, in practice it is not possible to define a ‘risk-free’ rate. The problem is that rates can change over the life of an option, especially when markets are more volatile.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>The Black-Scholes model is the best known of all the techniques for valuing options. It is used in the pricing of both options and futures and forms the basis for formulas pricing exotic options such as barriers, compounds and Asian options. It also enabled the derivation of the ‘Greeks’ of option pricing. It is more difficult to adapt to value interest rate options because one of the model’s underlying assumptions is a constant interest rate.</p>
<p>The model takes its name from two economists, Fischer Black and Myrton Scholes, who published a research paper, “The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities”, in the Journal of Political Economy in 1973.</p>
<p>The value of the call option (<math>
<mrow>
<mi>C</mi>
</mrow>
</math>) is a function of the present values of both purchasing the stock outright and paying the exercise price on the day the option expires. This is shown by the two parts of the model in the following equation:</p>

<p>Where component 
<math>
<mrow>
<mi>A</mi>

<p>Sometimes it is important for the treasurer to understand what investors are looking at when considering a company as a potential investment. Unless a rights issue is planned, the share price alone should have no impact on the company’s day-to-day financial position. This is because a change in the share price will have no immediate impact on the company’s liquidity.</p>
<p>In practice, shareholders, through the board, influence the day-to-day operation of the business. Each shareholder, especially the institutions, will have target returns from their share, and other, investments in the company. These institutions will expect certain results from some or all of the following ratios. If these are not met, institutions may either require a change in operational direction or sell their shareholdings. Either decision may have a serious impact on the treasurer’s ability to perform his or her job.</p>
<p>The key ratios which investors use are:</p>

<p>There is much debate over what constitutes the most accurate measurement of a company’s profitability. To some extent, this debate is irrelevant. Investors will have their own views on whether a company constitutes a ‘good investment’. These views will vary, but are typically based on a combination of the ratios stated above and a view of the future.</p>
<p>It is important that companies maintain a good relationship with their institutional investors in particular, so that they can understand what the shareholders want. Irrespective of the narrative in financial reports, much emphasis is placed on the simple numbers, within both the existing shareholders’ base and the wider marketplace. Underperformance can affect existing shareholder relationships as well as the future ability to raise funds both through share issuance and otherwise.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Investors will want to assess how efficiently a company uses its assets. There are a number of different ratios which can be used.</p>
<p>These ratios can be used in two ways. Firstly the ratio can be compared with the ratios of other companies in the same industry. Secondly these ratios should be compared over time, as this will suggest whether the situation is improving or deteriorating.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Collection period ratio or days sales outstanding (DSO)</h5>
<p>This ratio gives the time it takes the company to translate its receivables into cash. Any figure over the company’s regular payment terms suggests the common practice of late payment. It also suggests the company is being forced to borrow additional funds to finance its working capital. A low figure should indicate an efficient collection process, but it may mean the company’s credit policy is too restrictive. The figure can vary a lot during the year as the accounts receivable figure is taken at a point in time. More sophisticated analysis will average the accounts receivable figure throughout the year, but this data is not available from published accounts.</p>
<p>The ratio is calculated using the following formula and will give a result in days:</p>
<p><math>
<mrow>
<mtext>DSO</mtext>
<mo>=</mo>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mtext>Total accounts receivable</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>Total annual sales</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
<mo>x</mo>
<mn>365</mn>
</mrow>
</math></p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Sales to inventory ratio</h5>
<p>This ratio shows how quickly a company translates its inventory into sales. In general, a higher figure suggests an efficient operation. However, this requires further investigation as it may suggest that a company is understocked and therefore missing key sales. If the figure is low, it may suggest that it is overstocked or that the company operates in a cyclical business cycle. This ratio is another measure of working capital management. The figure can also vary a lot during the year as the inventory levels may be subject to seasonal variation.</p>
<p>This is calculated using the following formula 
		<math>
<mrow>
<mo>=</mo>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mtext>Total annual sales</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>inventory</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mrow>
</math></p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Assets to sales ratio</h5>
<p>This ratio shows how effectively the company uses both its fixed and variable assets. A high figure could suggest that the company is not being aggressive enough in the market place or that it has excess capacity. A low figure could suggest that the company is working close to capacity and that it could be susceptible to cash flow problems.</p>
<p>This is calculated using the following formula 
		<math>
<mrow>
<mo>=</mo>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mtext>Total assets</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>total annual sales</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mrow>
</math></p>
<p>In some cases, companies will be assessed on the ratio of net working capital to sales. This is more appropriate in industries which require significant capital investment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These ratios are in common use by both investors and corporate finance managers. It is important to remember that any assessment of this nature cannot stand alone. Rather, these ratios should be used as a tool to assess a company’s performance and as an indication that improvements are or are not being made. These ratios should always be used either in the context of past performance or in relation to similar companies in the sector.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>In the current economic climate, companies are rightly concerned with their working capital. Over recent years, the treasurer has become more central to working capital management in many organisations. There are a number of key ratios which provide an easy method of evaluating the relative importance of working capital to a company.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>The Current ratio</h5>
<p>This is defined as 
		<math>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mtext>Total current assets</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>Total current liabilities</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</math></p>
<p>Current assets include all the assets which the company can translate into cash within twelve months. Current liabilities include all liabilities which are required to be paid within twelve months. Therefore, the current ratio provides a good, but crude, indication of the company’s liquidity. A current ratio lower than 1 suggests that the company may have liquidity problems. The company will need to examine whether it needs to take action to ensure that it has sufficient cash to meet its obligations when they arise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>The Quick ratio</h5>
<p>This is defined as 
		<math>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mtext>Total current assets</mtext>
<mo> - </mo>
<mtext>inventory</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>Total current liabilities</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</math></p>
<p>This is sometimes referred to as the ‘acid test’ ratio. This may give a more accurate impression of the company’s liquidity. This is because the quick ratio recognises the fact that it can take some time to translate the company’s inventory into cash. The relative importance of the current ratio rather than the quick ratio depends on the nature of the company’s business and its ability to translate stock into cash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>The Cash ratio</h5>
<p>This is defined as 
		<math>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mtext>cash</mtext>
<mo> + </mo>
<mtext>short-term securities</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>Total current liabilities</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</math></p>
<p>In some cases, the company will only want to consider the assets which are readily available to meet payment obligations. This ratio measures whether the company has cash or near-cash assets to meet its short-term liabilities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All these ratios ignore the company’s ability to borrow additional funds. Because of this, these ratios provide a worst case scenario, which will be important when a company evaluates its liquidity.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[The Risk Adjusted Return On Capital (RAROC)]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Many companies choose to measure their profitability using concepts such as the Return on Capital Employed (ROCE – which we examined in Treasury Today March 2004) and the Return on Equity (RoE – which we examined in Treasury Today April 2004).</p>
<p>However, neither concept considers the risk that the company takes when investing in a particular project. In other words, they cannot distinguish between the return from a high risk project and that from a low risk one. Investors would expect a higher return, the greater the risk inherent in any project. This is why issuers of high yield bonds have a higher cost of borrowing than investment grade issuers.</p>
<p>This link is also recognised by the banking community, which developed RAROC from the 1970s as a tool to measure the risk inherent in their portfolios, so that an appropriate amount of capital could be set aside to protect against the effects of default. The imminent adoption of the second Basel Capital Accord places a strong emphasis on a bank’s ability to measure this level of capital. Banks also use this analysis to determine whether to provide credit to their corporate customers and, if so, at what cost.</p>

<mo> =</mo>
</mrow>
</math> capital set aside to meet the unexpected losses over the measured period with a given level of certainty.</p>
<p>Identifying the risk-adjusted return requires an analysis of the expected losses.</p>
<p>The risk-adjusted capital can be measured either from the top down or from bottom up.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Top-down.</h5>
<p>The first decision is to determine the desired level of certainty. Then, by running a Monte Carlo or similar simulation, identify the value of the capital at risk at this level of certainty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Bottom-down.</h5>
<p>The alternative is to identify the level of economic capital to set aside for each one of market, operational and credit risks, again to the desired level of certainty.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These calculations are complex, which is why they remain the preserve of banks. However, it is also important to recognise that banks are increasingly using this analysis to determine how to lend their balance sheets. Projects backed by the banks need to offer a return related to the amount of capital they set aside to manage them. Basel 2 will align the regulatory capital (that which banks have to set aside) with economic capital (which is what banks want to set aside). RAROC is one of the concepts the banks use to assess this.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Last month, we looked at the Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) as a measure of the profitability of a company. This allows a potential investor to assess whether to invest in a company and also provides a benchmark for treasurers and other company managers against the current cost of borrowing. This month we look at other profitability ratios.</p>
<h4 id="return-on-equity">Return on Equity</h4>
<p>Return on Equity (RoE) is often seen as an alternative to using ROCE as a measure of profitability.</p>
<p>The RoE is the earnings available for distribution to shareholders. This can be calculated by using the following equation:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mtext>RoE</mtext>
<mo>=</mo>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mtext>PBIT</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>Equity</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>Where <math>
<mrow>
<mtext>PBIT</mtext>
<mo> = </mo>
<mtext>Profit before interest</mtext>
</mrow>
</math> and <math>

<mtext>taxes</mtext>
<mo>=</mo>
<mtext>Total revenue</mtext>
<mo>-</mo>
<mtext>costs</mtext>
<mo>-</mo>
<mtext>depreciation</mtext>
</mrow>
</math></p>
<p>This equation provides the proportional return on each shareholding. It is important for treasurers and financial managers to watch RoE because current and prospective equity investors will track it. As a benchmark of effective use of capital, it is less useful for the treasurer as it ignores the impact of long-term debt.</p>
<h4 id="net-profit-margin">Net profit margin</h4>
<p>Another easy ratio to calculate is the net profit margin. This identifies the proportion of profit for each sale made by the company. It is calculated using the following equation:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mtext>Net profit margin</mtext>
<mo>=</mo>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mtext>PBIT</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>sales</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>Current and prospective investors will assess the net profit margin as it will give them a view of the underlying profitability of the business. Whereas both RoE and ROCE take a long-term view (they both include equity and ROCE includes long-term debt), the net profit margin provides a shorter term perspective.</p>
<p>In some cases, an investor will want to use a modified equation to calculate the net profit marginafter tax:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mtext>Net profit margin after tax</mtext>
<mo>=</mo>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mfenced>
<mrow>
<mtext>PBIT</mtext>
<mo> - </mo>
<mtext>tax</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfenced>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>sales</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>This recognises that only the post-tax earnings are available to shareholders.</p>
<h4 id="a-range-of-tools-are-used">A range of tools are used</h4>
<p>For the treasurer, it is important to recognise that current and prospective investors and equity analysts will all use a range of different tools and financial ratios in order to try to determine a company’s inherent profitability. All have flaws, so no prudent investor will rely on a single figure when making an assessment. The different measures may also provide contradictory results. A prudent finance function will track all these ratios, especially if the company will be trying to raise additional funds.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Any investor considering a project will look at the return that can be generated. When the investment is a shareholding in a company, the potential investor will want to assess the profitability of the company. There are a number of different ways of establishing this. One of the most commonly used is the Return on Capital Employed (ROCE).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ROCE is a concept which is used by providers of capital (investors and banks) and companies to measure profitability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ROCE is defined as earned profits divided by total capital employed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Earned profits are usually defined as profit before interest and tax (PBIT).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Total capital is usually defined as total assets minus current liabilities. This is the same as long-term debt plus shareholders’ equity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This can be seen as <math>
<mrow>
<mtext>ROCE</mtext>
<mo>=</mo>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mtext>profit before Interest and tax</mtext>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mtext>total capital employed</mtext>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
</mrow>
</math></p>
<h4 id="illustration-of-roce">Illustration of ROCE</h4>
<p>Consider a company which produced profits before interest and tax of €12,345,000 in 2002. It had €200m of shareholder capital and a number of short-term loan facilities.</p>
<p>In 2002, the company generated a <math>
<mrow>
<mtext>ROCE of</mtext>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mn>12,345</mn>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mn>200,000</mn>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
<mo>=</mo>
<mn>6.17</mn>
<mo>%</mo>
</mrow>
</math></p>
<p>In 2003, it raised an additional €200m through a long-term bond issues in order to both fund an expansion programme and to repay some of the short-term debt. This meant that the total capital employed increased to €400m. During this period, its profits grew to €23.5m.</p>
<p>These figures mean that, in 2003, the company generated a <math>
<mrow>
<mtext>ROCE of</mtext>
<mfrac>
<mrow>
<mn>23,456</mn>
</mrow>
<mrow>
<mn>400,000</mn>
</mrow>
</mfrac>
<mo>=</mo>
<mn>5.86</mn>
<mo>%</mo>
</mrow>
</math></p>
<p>This illustration highlights some of the dangers of ROCE. Although ROCE fell in 2003, the profits earned by the company almost doubled. The main reason for the decline in ROCE was the injection of capital into the business. Managers would argue that it takes longer than a year to translate that capital injection into profitability.</p>
<p>At the same time, the company was able to consolidate some of its short-term debt. This debt had not been considered in 2002 ROCE, but was in 2003.</p>
<p>Managers will want to ensure that the ROCE remains above the company’s borrowing rate. If not, any additional borrowing will reduce the company’s earnings.</p>
<p>ROCE is a useful benchmark figure for treasurers and other company managers as well as for investors. It is easy to calculate and provides a clear reference against the current cost of borrowing. However, the illustration above shows that the ROCE should not be used in isolation as a measure of profitability. Changes should be explained using alternative financial ratios and with narrative.</p>

<h3 id="difficulties-with-wacc">Difficulties with WACC</h3>
<p>Although the after-tax WACC formula outlined above is the most commonly used by companies seeking to evaluate their investment activities, it is important to remember its limitations.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>WACC is, as its name implies, an average measure. This is an average across different operating units within the company as a whole. It is also an average of different forms of financing over time. Any new financing will affect the overall cost of capital.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The formula assumes the correct calculation of both the expected return on debt and the expected return on equity. Both of these are almost impossible to calculate accurately. The expected return on debt is not the same as the current bond rate or the bank loan rate, as neither includes an assessment of the credit risk, which is the risk of potential default. The expected return on equity is even more difficult to evaluate as every shareholder’s expected returns are different.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The formula implies that the cost of capital is determined by the expected returns on debt, equity and any other sources of financing. In practice, the expected returns are themselves determined by the risk appetite of the company as a whole – investors will want a higher return when investing in a riskier business. In other words, the inherent risk of the company’s activities determines both the expected returns and the WACC.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the WACC formula is based on a series of assumptions, it will never be completely accurate. Nonetheless, it is a very useful measure. Users simply need to be aware of its limitations.</p></p></p>

<p>However, this formula does not acknowledge the fact that interest payments on debt instruments are tax-deductible. In order to reflect this, we need to amend the formula to reflect this.</p>

<p>Using the same example as last month, it is possible to identify the impact of the tax rebate on the overall WACC.</p>
<p>Last month, we showed that the WACC of Company X was 5.77%. Company X issued 200,000 shares now selling at 12.25 a share and has $1.75m of outstanding debt. Its average cost of borrowing is 4.75% and the shares are currently offering a return of 6.5%. If its marginal tax rate is 30%, what is the effect on WACC if that is included in the calculation?</p>

For example, if Company X had issued preferred stock in addition to equity, the WACC formula could be amended to read:</p>

		<title><![CDATA[CAPM and the three-factor model]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>In last month’s issue, we identified a number of problems with the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and saw how the Arbitrage Pricing Model sought to overcome them. There is another alternative to the CAPM which recognises its problems without overcomplicating matters.</p>
<p>Research into the CAPM identified two problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The stocks of small firms outperformed the market’s average returns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The stocks of companies with high book-to-market ratios also outperformed the market.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The researchers, Fama and French, argued that these problems represented factors which were missing from the CAPM.</p>
<p>They argue that three factors need to be considered when assessing asset prices. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>The market as a whole</h5>
<p>This is defined as the return on assets in the market as a whole less the return on a risk-free investment (such as government bonds or cash).</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>The size of the company issuing the security</h5>
<p>This factor is defined as the return on small company securities less the return on large company securities. Fama and French found that shares in small companies outperformed the market by 0.2% per month in the period 1926-1997.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>The book-to-market factor</h5>
<p>This factor is defined as the return on securities issued by companies with high bookto-market ratios less the return on securities issued by companies with low book-to-market ratios. Fama and French found that cheap stocks (those with high book-to-market ratios, referred to as ‘value’ stocks) outperformed by 0.43% per month in the period 1926-1997. This was not related to the volatility of these stocks. They argued that the ‘value’ stocks are higher risk because of the perceived risk of failure, preserving the link between risk and return.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As with the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (explained in Treasury Today October 2003), having identified these factors, the risk premium of each factor and the risk sensitivity of each investment to these factors needs to be calculated.</p>
<p>These could then be used to calculate the expected return on an investment, thus:</p>

</li>

<li>
<p><math>
<mrow>
<mtext>R <sub>market factor1</sub></mtext>
</mrow>
</math> etc. are the risk premiums for each factor.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This should provide the expected return on an investment. However, this is not as commonly used as the CAPM, mainly because the findings of French and Fama have been subject to criticisms themselves.</p>
<h4 id="capm-revisited">CAPM revisited</h4>
<p>As the two criticisms (explained above and in October’s newsletter) illustrate, there is still some debate over the usefulness of the CAPM. However, it remains an important tool for treasurers as it is still used by investors when assessing the relative risk of alternative potential investments.</p>
<p>The key factor to recall when using the CAPM is that it is a predictive model. Many of the criticisms of the model are based on empirical evidence calculated after the event. Most investors (apart from the luckiest) would change their original investments with the benefit of hindsight. As a predictive model, the CAPM does not have that benefit either and its results will never be totally accurate after the event. However, because it is used by investors, it gives treasurers an insight into likely investor behaviour.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>In last month’s issue, we examined the basic Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). We saw that the model states that the expected return on an investment is directly proportional to that investment’s volatility (or Beta, ß).</p>
<p>The relationship is defined as:</p>
<figure>
<math>

</li>
<li>
<p><math>
<mrow>
<mtext>R<sub>f</sub></mtext>
</mrow>
</math> is the return on a risk-free investment (for example, a short-term government security or cash)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><math>
<mrow>
<mtext>R<sub>m</sub></mtext>

</math> is the rate of return for the appropriate asset class or the market as a whole</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><math>
<mrow>
<mo>ß</mo>
</mrow>
</math> is the volatility of the security with respect to the appropriate asset class or the market.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A number of empirical studies questioned the relationship between expected return and volatility which the CAPM predicts.</p>
<p>Two main concerns were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>That the security market line (which shows the relationship between risk, in the form of Beta, and return) is too flat. If this is the case, there is only a marginal increase in expected return as volatility grows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Return varies according to size – smaller companies have been found to provide greater returns than larger ones.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some criticisms of CAPM after empirical studies were inevitable. This is because the CAPM was developed as a predictive model to provide the expected return on an investment, whereas the empirical studies used actual observed results after the event. There are many reasons why a return is not as expected. As a predictive model, the CAPM cannot take them into account.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is possible to explain the concerns. For example, the return for smaller companies can be explained by the liquidity of their assets. Smaller companies’ equity will be relatively less liquid than that in larger companies. There will be higher transaction costs associated with trades in smaller companies. Investors in smaller companies will insist on a higher return to compensate for these higher costs.</p>
<h4 id="arbitrage-pricing-theory">Arbitrage Pricing Theory</h4>
<p>As an alternative to CAPM, the Arbitrage Pricing Theory was developed. This assumes that an investment return is dependent on macroeconomic factors as well as the imperfections in the market (or ‘noise’).</p>
<p>A company’s share price, for instance, will be subject to two different types of risk. Firstly, there is the performance of the economy as a whole – this cannot be reduced by diversification within a portfolio. Secondly, each individual asset within a portfolio will be affected by factors specific to the issuer – these can be reduced within a diversified portfolio.</p>
<p>In other words, the theory argues that as long as a portfolio is diversified, an investor need only consider the macroeconomic factors when identifying expected risk.</p>
<p>Therefore the theory states that there are three key stages to identifying expected returns:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Identify the relevant macroeconomic factors. These will be the factors that will most affect any cash flows associated with the investment and their value. There is, however, no agreement as to what these factors should be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Estimate the risk premium on each factor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Estimate the risk sensitivity of each investment to these factors.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These could then be used to calculate the expected return on an investment, thus:</p>

</mrow>
</math> is the return on a risk-free investment (for example, a short-term government security or cash)</p>

<mrow>
<mtext>b<sub>1</sub></mtext>

</math>, <math>
<mrow>
<mtext>b<sub>2</sub></mtext>

</math>, etc. are the investment’s sensitivities to each factor, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><math>
<mrow>
<mtext>R <sub>factor1</sub></mtext>
</mrow>
</math> etc. are the risk premiums for each factor.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This result should then provide the expected return on an investment which should be related to the investment’s contribution to risk within a portfolio.</p>
<p>The arbitrage pricing theory is so-named because, if the relationship did not hold, then it would be possible to make a profit by selling those assets that offer a lower than expected return and purchasing those promising a higher return, given the relative exposure to risk.</p>
<p>However, the arbitrage pricing model is not as commonly used as the CAPM. One reason for this is the difficulty in determining the different and relative macroeconomic factors.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Being able to calculate the cost of capital is important when you are seeking to raise funds from investors to invest in a particular project. At the heart of any cost of capital calculation is the balance between risk and reward expected by the potential investors. These investors are assumed to be risk averse. This means that the greater the risk, the greater the return they will expect on any investment that they make.</p>
<p>The concept of a Capital Asset Pricing Model was developed in the 1960s and provides a link between the risk and the return that investors expect. The model defines a line, described as the security market line, that can be drawn on a graph and which states that the expected return on an investment is directly proportional to that investment’s volatility. This volatility is known as beta or ß. The average ß is 1.0. Less risky investments have a ß of less than 1.0 whilst riskier investments have a ß of more than 1.0.</p>
<p>The relationship is defined as:</p>

This also shows that the ß of a riskfree investment is 0. By definition, a portfolio containing all of the assets in the asset class, or the market as a whole, will have a ß of 1.0 since it will be the average.</p>

<h5>Next month</h5>
<p>Although the Capital Asset Pricing Model describes the link between risk and return, it has been criticised for being too simplistic. In <a href="/2003/10/capm-and-arbitrage-pricing-theory">next month</a> we examine some of those criticisms in more detail.</p>
</aside>
<p>The security market line is important as it shows the minimum return that an investor will expect on a project. Indeed, according to the model, because the ß (the slope of the line) is calculated with respect to the asset class or market as a whole, all stocks will lie on the security market line.</p>
<p>This can be used to calculate the expected rate of return on an investment in Company A. If we assume that the return on a government bond is 3.0%, the return in the stock market as a whole is 8% and the ß of Company A’s stock is 0.8, then we can use the formula above to calculate the expected rate of return for that stock:</p>

<p>A company with a known future borrowing requirement can protect itself against any interest rate risk by borrowing the required amount today and then placing the borrowed sum on deposit until it is required. Because the act of placing the cash on deposit counteracts the cost of borrowing, this action means that the company is borrowing at one point in the future and repaying on a second date – hence, a forward-forward.</p>
<p>Because the initial cost of borrowing is mitigated by the time on deposit, the treasurer will want to calculate the effective cost of borrowing. This will be done by using two different interest rates – one for the full period of borrowing and one for the shorter period whilst the borrowed cash is on deposit. This is also the basis used by banks quoting forward-forward prices.</p>

<p>Consider a company which knows that it has a borrowing requirement of €10m in one month for five months. It has a number of ways to protect itself against the interest rate risk. One solution is to borrow €10m today for six months. This €10m can then be placed on deposit for one month until it is required. Effectively, this means that the company will only start borrowing in one month for five months. In order to calculate the cost of borrowing, the treasurer will use the above formula. If the six month interest rate is 3.8%, the one month interest rate is 4.1% and interest is calculated on an actual/360 day basis, the forward-forward interest rate will be:</p>

<p>In Treasury Today September 2001, we showed how to calculate a forward foreign exchange rate using the following formula:</p>

<p>We showed that the forward outright rate is simply a function of the current spot rate and the interest rates in both currencies. We also explained that, by convention, currency pairs (e.g. GBP/EUR) are always quoted in the same way. The first named currency is known as the ‘base’ currency and the second the ‘variable’ currency.</p>
<aside>
<p>Note that in most cases the convention is that, in the currency pair, it is the USD that is quoted first and is, therefore, the base currency. The most common exceptions are GBP/USD, EUR/USD, AUD/USD and NZD/USD.</p>
</aside>
<p>Assume that the interest rate in the UK is 5.00% and in the Eurozone is 3.75% and the current spot rate is 1.422. GBP, as the first quoted currency, is the base currency and EUR is the variable currency – this can be remembered as the spot rate quotes the number of Euros per £1. The formula above gives the following rate for 31 days forward:</p>

<p>(Note the different year convention used for the interest calculation)</p>
<h3 id="using-a-points-adjustment">Using a points adjustment</h3>
<p>There is an alternative to this method of calculating the forward rate using the differential in the two interest rates. This calculates a ‘points adjustment’ which is then added to or some subtracted from the spot rate to provide the forward rate.</p>
<p>If the interest rate in the base currency is higher than that in the variable currency, then the points should be subtracted from the spot rate. This means that the forward rate will be lower than the spot rate.</p>
<p>If the interest rate in the base currency is lower than that in the variable currency, then the points should be added to the spot rate, making the forward rate higher than the spot rate.</p>
<p>We use the following equation:</p>

<p>Using the example above:</p>
<p>The spot rate is 1.422, the interest differential is 1.25 (which is divided by 100) and there are 31 days to settlement. In this case, there are 365 days in the year, as GBP is the base currency. Therefore the points adjustment =</p>

<p>Where i = yield, C is the coupon expressed as an annual rate which is paid n times a year, w is the proportion of the current coupon period remaining and t is the number of outstanding future payments or cash flows.</p>
<p>This equation assumes firstly that future values are compound discounted to a net present value and secondly that there are regular periods between coupon payments.</p>
<p>We started by breaking the equation down into four component parts. In previous issues, we have shown how one component takes into account the time until the next cash flow and how another recognises the amount of all future coupon payments.</p>
<p>This month, we look at the third component, which discounts the principal to a present value. This is the component:</p>

<h4 id="recognising-the-future-value-of-the-principal">Recognising the future value of the principal</h4>
<p>The value of a bond is dependent upon two types of cash flow – the principal, which will be repaid at maturity, and the coupon payments, which are assumed, in this model, to be fixed and paid at regular intervals. A bond investor will only pay the net present value of all future cash flows, both the repayment of principal and the coupon payments.</p>
<p>The future value of the principal is dependent on the face value of the bond (usually 100), on the yield (i) and the time to redemption (t). The number and timing of coupon payments a year are also factors. This is because the bond investor will calculate the value of the bond on the assumption that the investment could be reinvested at the current yield whenever a coupon payment is made.</p>
<p>These factors are taken into account by the expression <math>

<p>This is the same discount factor that was explained in last month’s issue. Using such a discount factor, it is possible to discount the future cash flow (in this case the redemption of principal) to a net present value.</p>
<p>When discounting the value of the principal, t-1 is used (rather than t). This relates to the fact that an investor is prepared to pay the net present value of all future cash flows. The t-1 recognises the assumption that the periods between the first and the last coupon payments are even. If there are ten coupon payments to come, then there are nine (t-1) periods between the first and the last coupon payments to be discounted. The period to the first coupon payment is accounted for by the first expression in the equation, which was explained in Treasury Today March 2003.</p>
<p>We can explain this by considering the value of a bond with only one cash flow to come, i.e. t=1, using the equation on above:</p>

<p>as the last coupon payment is also the first coupon payment and x<sup>0</sup> = 1.</p>
<p>This shows that the bond holder will receive a final coupon payment – future value C/n x 100 – and the redemption of principal (assumed to be 100). These figures will then be discounted to reflect the time to the final coupon payment by the first component in the equation. This was explained in Treasury Today March 2003. This is the sum that an investor will be prepared to pay to receive that final payment.</p>
<h4 id="an-illustration">An illustration</h4>
<p>To show how this equation works, let us assume that an investor wants a price for a bond which pays semi-annual coupons at a coupon rate of 6%. The current yield is 5% and there are ten further cash flows due, with the next one due in three months’ time, i.e. w=1/2.</p>

<p>It is important to recognise that the results given by this equation are not exactly the same as those which would be achieved by adding the net present values of the future coupon payments individually. Calculating each cash flow individually will provide a more accurate value of a bond, particularly when comparing different bonds with different characteristics or when calculating the value of bonds with a short maturity.</p>
<p>However, this equation remains important because it is the one usually used in the bond market to calculate price.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>There is no calculation this month because we want to explain a concept we will be using over the next few months. The concept is how to produce a bond price.</p>
<p>A bond is issued by a bank or corporation for a specific period or term. At the end of the bond’s term, the current bond holders are repaid the initial investment plus a final interest payment (known as the coupon). Many bonds also pay the current bond holder interim interest payments (or coupons) on a regular basis (for example, annually, semi-annually or quarterly). The exception is a zero-coupon bond.</p>
<p>The potential bond investor will know the cash value of the bond and its associated coupons in advance. The investor will discount those future cash flows to a present value. The net present value of all the future cash flows is the price that the potential investor is prepared to pay.</p>
<p>The price of the bond is therefore dependent not only upon the coupon rate, but also the internal rate of return of the investment. The internal rate of return is the constant rate at which the future cash flows are discounted to a present value which is equal to the price of the bond. This internal rate of return then becomes the yield of the bond. So by calculating the value of the future cash flows and taking the bond price today, the yield is calculated.</p>
<p>This means that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The amount of each future cash flow is dependent on the coupon rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The net present value of these future cash flows is dependent on the internal rate of return – the rate at which the future cash flow is discounted back to a present value</p>
</li>
</ul>
<aside>
<h5>Index</h5>
<p>See Treasury Today November 2001 for more on <a href="/2001/11/translating-future-cash-flows-into-a-net-present-value">the use of this equation</a>.</p>
</aside>
<p>The bond price will also have to incorporate a value for the ‘accrued coupon’ if the bond is sold part way through an interest period. Because the holder of the bond receives the coupon on the coupon date, the seller of the bond will want to be compensated for that period between the coupon dates when they held the bond.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>A company can get access to short term cash by entering into a ‘repo’ agreement with another party. A ‘repo’ agreement – strictly a sale and repurchase agreement – involves two transactions. First, a company sells a security to another party for cash, settling according to the market convention. The company then repurchases the same security for the same price plus interest on a predetermined date in the future. In the previous two issues, we have shown, using the example below, how to calculate the amount of cash required to pay for the initial transfer of the security and how to determine the interest payable when repurchasing the security, the repurchase part of the transaction.</p>

<p>In October 2002, Company X had a requirement for some short term cash. It decided to enter into a repo agreement using a bond as security. The bond has a face value of €40m. The bond pays an annual coupon of 6%, quoted on an actual/actual basis. The previous coupon was paid on 25<sup>th</sup> September 2002.</p>
<p>Company X decided to enter into a repo agreement on 28<sup>th</sup> October 2002. The initial transaction settled on 30<sup>th</sup> October 2002. The second leg was to be settled on 24<sup>th</sup> November 2002, i.e. 25 days later. On 28<sup>th</sup> October, the clean bond price for value two days later was 105.25. The repo rate was 3.5%, quoted on an actual/360 basis.</p>

<h4 id="step-three-calculating-the-implied-rate-of-interest">Step Three: Calculating the implied rate of interest</h4>
<p>The final calculation that a company needs to make is to identify the real rate of interest it is being charged for the repo agreement. This is so that the company can assess whether the repo agreement is the cheapest way of securing the required short-term cash. This can be done by comparing the interest rates that apply for the repo agreement with any that apply for other types of funding.</p>
<p>To determine the real rate of interest, use the following formula:</p>

</math>. When comparing interest rates, it is important that you compare on the basis of the same number of days in the year. If the other potential sources of funding our company wants to compare are quoted on a 365 day basis, then we need to calculate the implied rate on a 365 day year. There are 25 days between the first and second legs.</p>

<p>Had the company wanted to compare on a 360 day basis, the implied rate would have been 3.5%, the same as the repo rate. This highlights the importance of comparing interest rates on a standard basis.</p>

<p>There are three calculations that need to be performed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>The cash paid for the initial sale of the security.</h5>
<p>This is the sum that will be borrowed. Note – as with other money market transactions, repo agreements are subject to trader jargon. Make sure that, should you enter into a repo agreement, you are clear which side of the agreement you will be on. Although you will be borrowing cash, you are also lending the security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>The cash that the will have to be paid to repurchase the security.</h5>
<p>This will equal the initial sum borrowed plus interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>The implied interest rate,</h5>
<p>which will allow the borrower to determine whether the repo agreement is the best method of accessing short term cash.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[Bond pricing: The Internal Rate of Return with Irregular Cash Flows]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Over the last two months we have shown, firstly, how to calculate the internal rate of return (IRR) where interest is paid annually and, secondly, how to calculate IRR when it is paid regularly, but more or less frequently than once a year. This month we deal with irregular cash flows.</p>
<p>As with our previous illustrations, to perform this calculation accurately, we need the use of a calculator with a time value of money function.</p>
<h3 id="irregular-cash-flows">Irregular cash flows</h3>
<p>This method of calculation is not really suitable for a bond that pays irregular cash flows. However, it is possible to ‘regularise’ a number of irregular cash flows by inventing a sufficient number of zero interest payments. This will have the effect of translating the irregular cash flows into a series of regular cash flows, albeit one where a few are zero returns. When this means that the interest periods are not annual the final result needs to be adjusted using one of the two formulae outlined last month.</p>
<h3 id="illustration">Illustration</h3>
<p>Consider the following example. An investor can purchase a bond for £250 now, which will give rise to cash flows of £10 after six months, £20 after one year, £30 after two years and £340 (£90 plus repayment of the principal) after five years. How can we calculate the internal rate of return?</p>
<p>First of all, we have to regularise the cash flows. We do this by assuming that there are regular cash flows every six months, although many of them are zero. In other words, we input zero returns for the third and fifth to ninth periods in the calculation process. This is shown below:</p>

</figure>
<p>This can then be entered into the calculator.</p>
<h5 id="hp12c">HP12C</h5>
<p>Using an HP12C calculator (which has a time value of money function), we need to press the following keys:</p>

</tbody>

</figure>
<p>This gives the result 5.535%. Having regularised the calculation by using six monthly payments, this result is not an annual return.</p>
<p>Therefore we have to adjust this result to an annual return in the same way as we did last month:</p>

<p>This shows that it is possible to regularise a set of irregular cash flows. However this can be difficult if the periods are very irregular as these will result in a large number of zero returns, which are difficult to manage.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Last month, we showed how to calculate and use the internal rate of return (IRR) where interest is paid annually. This allows different investments with different associated cash flows to be compared. This month we examine IRR where regular cash flows arise either more or less frequently than once a year.</p>
<p>As with our illustration last month, to perform this calculation accurately, we need the use of a calculator with a time value of money function.</p>
<h3 id="last-months-illustration-annual-cash-flows-on-an-investment">Last month’s illustration – annual cash flows on an investment</h3>
<p>Last month, we used the example of an investor who had the opportunity to purchase a bond for £250 now, which would give rise to cash flows of £10 at the end of year 1, £20 at the end of year 2, £30 at the end of year 3, £40 at the end of year 4 and £300 (£50 plus repayment of principal) at the end of year 5. We calculated the internal rate of return as 11.16%.</p>
<h3 id="zero-interest">Zero interest</h3>
<p>This illustration and the HP12C calculator both assume that some interest is paid annually. If an IRR is being calculated using the HP12C, when no interest would be earned, the zero cash flow should be entered (and not ignored).</p>
<h3 id="different-interest-periods">Different interest periods</h3>
<p>This method of calculation will work for any regular series of cash flows, whether more or less frequent. But, because the calculator assumes that all payments are annual payments, any result needs to be annualised.</p>
<h3 id="more-frequent-payments">More frequent payments</h3>
<p>For example, let’s assume that our investor has the opportunity to purchase the same bond for £250 now but that it will give rise to cash flows every six months. These cash flows rise each year as in the first example, but the payments are received every six months rather than annually.</p>
<p>In year 1, these two cash flows will be £5 at the end of six months and at the end of year 1. In year 2 the payments will be £10 every six months, in year 3 £15, in year 4 £20 and in year 5 the investor will receive a payment of £25 after six months and £275 at the end of the year (£25 plus repayment of principal).</p>
<p>We can calculate the internal rate of return using the same process as last month, which gives a result of 5.569%. Obviously this is wrong. The calculator has assumed that all the payments were made annually and so has underestimated the IRR. We need to adjust the result to reflect the fact that interest is paid more frequently, every six months</p>
<p>To do so, we need to perform the following calculation:</p>
<p><math>

</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<h3 id="less-frequent-payments">Less frequent payments</h3>
<p>On the other hand, let us assume that the investor will receive no interim interest payments whilst holding the £250 bond, but will receive £400 on redemption at the end of year 5 (£150 interest plus repayment of principal).</p>
<p>We can still calculate the internal rate of return in the same way with the calculator but this gives a result of 60%. This is clearly an overestimate which has arisen because of the calculator’s assumption of annual payments. It has assumed the repayment was at the end of year 1 not year 5. Again we need to adjust the result to reflect this.</p>
<p>To do so, we need to perform the following calculation:</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Last month, we showed how to translate a future value into a net present value (and vice versa), assuming a prevailing interest rate. This month we look at another way to calculate future value, the internal rate of return.</p>
<p>When contemplating an investment, we may be asked to pay a certain sum on the understanding that we will receive certain cash flows in the future. In other words, we know that we will have to pay a present value to receive certain future values. Before deciding whether to make the investment as described, we will want to compare it with alternatives.</p>
<p>One way to do that is to calculate the internal rate of return, the rate of return generated by the investment regardless of prevailing interest rates. This is the interest rate that translates the future cash flows into a net present value such that the sum of all the discounted future values is equal to the amount we propose to invest. We can then compare the internal rates of return of alternative possible investments, knowing that we are comparing ‘like with like’. This is particularly useful when investments yield different cash flows or the same or different cash flows at different intervals.</p>
<p>To perform this calculation accurately, we need the use of a calculator with a time value of money function. The alternative is to use iteration (trial and error) for the series of cash flows. This will be very time-consuming, particularly if they are irregular.</p>
<h3 id="illustration">Illustration</h3>
<p>Assume that an investor can purchase a bond now for £250 which will give rise to cash flows of £10 at the end of year 1, £20 at the end of year 2, £30 at the end of year 3, £40 at the end of year 4 and £50 plus repayment of principal (total cash flow of £300) at the end of year 5. What is the internal rate of return?</p>
<h5 id="hp12c">HP12C</h5>
<p>Using an HP12C calculator (which has a time value of money function), we need to press the following keys:</p>

<p>This is the constant interest rate at which all five future cash flows are discounted to a present value equal to the initial £250 investment.</p>

<p>This illustration has assumed the existence of annual cash flows. We will examine IRR where cash flows arise more or less frequently next month.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-this-mean">What does this mean?</h3>
<p>This means that an investment in the bond with the associated cash flows illustrated above is equivalent to any other investment with an internal rate of return of 11.16%. For example, it is equivalent to an investment where £250 is invested at a rate of 11.16% for five years with annual interest payments (which would result in a cash flow of £424.31 at the end of the five year period). It does assume that the four annual cash flows are reinvested at the same rate.</p>
<h3 id="the-use-of-internal-rate-of-return">The use of internal rate of return</h3>
<p>Different investments (whether bonds or capital projects) with different associated cash flows can be compared using the internal rate of return. However it is important to remember that the calculation we have illustrated above assumes constant reinvestment rates. The timing and size of cash flows arising from investments should always be considered.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the Windows calculator is unable to make this calculation as it does not have this functionality but there is an IRR function in Excel and it is possible to perform these calculations using numerous resources available on the Internet. A search at any of the proprietary search sites will give you lots of options.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>The key to bond pricing is the concept of the time value of money. In Treasury Today April 2001, we showed how to calculate the total proceeds of a long term investment. We showed that if we invested £100 for 10 years at an annual rate of 8%, we would receive £215.89 at the end of the ten year investment period. This assumes that the interest earned annually would be reinvested in the same vehicle as the original investment. The initial £100 is the present value of the investment and the £215.89 is the future value of the investment.</p>
<p>When making an investment an investment such as this, the investor will know the present value of the sum to be invested, the time period for which the investment will be made and the interest rate that will be applied. The unknown is the future value.</p>
<p>In contrast, the potential investor in a bond will know the future value of the bond, which is the payment due on maturity, and will want calculate its present value, given the time until the bond’s maturity and the current market interest rate.</p>
<p>The following formula links present value (PV), future value (FV), the interest rate (i) and the length of time to maturity in years (n):</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Executing a foreign exchange transaction between the major international currencies is usually straightforward, as most banks will be trading and making a price between all the major currencies. However, for less common currencies, many banks will not run books and therefore rates are not always quoted or easily available.</p>
<p>In order to establish the appropriate rate of exchange, the cross-rate between the two currencies has to be calculated. This works by translating the first currency into a common currency (often the US Dollar) and then translating the common currency into the second currency. This then determines the cross-rate between the two currencies.</p>
<p>All foreign exchange rates are quoted base currency/variable currency – in other words, an amount of the variable currency in exchange for one unit of the base currency. So for USD/CAD, the US Dollar is the base currency and the rate quoted will be the amount of Canadian Dollars for one US Dollar.</p>
<p>In most cases, the base currency will be US dollars for both currencies and this will enable the cross-rate to be calculated quite easily. However, for some currencies, the FX market convention is that the US Dollar is the variable currency, such as in the trade GBP/USD when the pound becomes the base currency and the amount of dollars varies.</p>
<p>Finally we must remember that for all foreign exchange trades, the dealer can quote two numbers – the first is the bid rate (the rate at which the trader will buy the currency), the second is the offer rate (the rate at which the trader will sell the currency). The dealer always wants more currency if selling units of the base currency than will be given away if currency is being provided for units of the base currency. The difference is the margin and is one of the sources of profit to the dealer.</p>

<p>Where there are two currencies Y and Z both of which are quoted against X, the two exchange rates are X/Y and X/Z and the cross-rates will be:</p>

<p>The first number is the rate at which the bank sells the currency being quoted against the US dollar and the second is the rate at which the bank buys the currency being quoted against the US dollar. So the cross rates can be calculated as:</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Interest rates are usually quoted for standard periods – one month, two months, three months and six months. In order to calculate an interest rate for an interim period, you have to interpolate a rate from the two nearest given rates. The interpolation assumes that the interest rate increases or decreases uniformly from one date to the next – in other words, the relationship is a straight line.</p>

<p>In last month’s issue, we looked at the concept of compound interest and saw how compounding accrued interest resulted in higher amounts of interest. We looked at the difference over a year between interest accruing annually and monthly.</p>
<p>It is, of course, possible that interest could accrue more frequently than monthly and, in such a scenario, still higher amounts of interest would arise.</p>

<p>The two methods of calculating interest (<a href="/2002/02/simple-and-compound-interest">simple and compound interest</a>) were explained in Calculator Corner in Treasury Today February 2002.</p>

</math> number of interest payments per year.</p>
<p>Increasing the number of interest payments a year will, as we saw last month, increase the annual proceeds from the investment. In most cases the maximum would occur if interest were calculated on a daily basis. However interest could, theoretically, be paid more frequently than this – by the hour, minute or even second. The logical conclusion is that there could be an infinite number of interest payments.</p>
<p>Derivatives are often valued on this basis using the concept of an infinite numbers of interest payments.</p>
<p>Where there are an infinite number of interest payments in a single year, the annual proceeds of the investment are from our formula:-</p>

<p>Mathematically, this formula can be solved using natural logarithms. But before doing this we can simplify the calculation since the proceeds of investment are:-</p>

<h4 id="what-is-e">What is e?</h4>
<p>The number e was first studied by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler in the 1720s, although its existence was more or less implied in the work of John Napier, the discoverer of logarithms, in 1614. e is an irrational number, so its decimal expansion never terminates, nor is it eventually periodic. Thus no matter how many digits in the expansion of e you know, the only way to predict the next one is to compute "e". It is used extensively in calculus and is the basis of logarithms. In some respects it is like p, it works for us. One maths teacher described e and p as the Burger King and McDonalds of the mathematics world.</p>

<p>Now we can simplify our formula since the total amount that accrues interest and principal is:-</p>
<figure>
<math>

</mrow>
</mfenced>
<mo>=</mo>
<mtext>Principal</mtext>
<mo>x</mo>
<mtext>e<sup>i</sup></mtext>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>

<h4 id="looking-more-at-e">Looking more at e</h4>
<p>Using our formula we can begin to see how e emerges if we take different interest rates. This is most simply demonstrated by using an example of an investment with an annual interest rate of 100%. From the equation above, the proceeds of the investment if interest is continuously compounded is Principal x e<sup>i</sup>. When the annual rate of interest is 100, the proceeds of the investment would be calculated as Principal x e<sup>i</sup> = Principal x e.</p>
<p>We know that the annual proceeds from an investment of 100 will be greater, the more frequent the interest payments accrue. Should interest accrue only once a year, the annual proceeds will be 100 (principal) + 100 (interest) = 200 (twice the initial investment).</p>
<p>If interest accrues twice a year, the annual proceeds will be 100 (principal) + 50 (first interest payment) + 75 (second interest payment – 50 earned on the principal and 25 earned on the reinvested interest) = 225 (2.25 times the initial investment).</p>
<p>The more times interest accrues and is compounded, the higher the annual proceeds. For example, if interest accrues three times a year (33.333% each time), annual proceeds will equal 2.37 times the principal. For four payments of 25%, annual proceeds will be 2.44 times the principal. Five payments will increase the investment by 2.49 times.</p>
<p>This pattern shows that the investor is always better off, the more often interest accrues. This improvement is, however, successively less. The best case scenario is when an infinite number of interest payments are made, in other words when interest is continuously compounded.</p>
<p>This case is the limit where an initial investment would multiply by 2.718281828… which is ‘e’! Although we have shown the case where the annual interest rate is 100%, this principle can be applied to any interest rate. This is done by using e as the base for what is called an exponential calculation such that the annual proceeds = Principal x e<sup>i</sup>.</p>

<h4 id="illustration-of-difference">Illustration of difference</h4>
<p>To show the effect of the different methods of calculating interest, we can compare investments of 100 over a year, assuming an interest rate of 6% per annum:</p>

<h3 id="summary-continuous-compounding-produces-higher-interest">Summary: Continuous compounding produces higher interest</h3>
<p>The greater the frequency that interest is earned, and therefore reinvested, the greater the final proceeds from any investment or interest charge on any loan. Continuous compounding therefore provides the highest possible earning potential for any given nominal rate of interest.</p>

<p>The buyers of a bond will pay the sellers a price equal to the NPV (net present value) of all the future cash flows. When a bond is sold on the market, it is often sold “between coupons”, i.e. part way through the interest period. The sellers will want to be compensated for the fact that, whilst they have held the bond since the last coupon date, they will not receive the next coupon or interest payment. In other words, they will want to be compensated for that portion of the period between coupon dates when they held the bond. This is known as accrued coupon or accrued interest.</p>

<p>In circumstances where the bond is sold very close to, but before, the coupon date, the coupon can be paid to the former owner (because the issuer may not have had time to update their records). In such circumstances, the bond is said to be ‘ex-dividend’ or ‘ex-coupon’ and the seller will have to pay the amount of the coupon due to the buyer. In these circumstances, the accrued coupon is calculated according to the following formula (and is negative):</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>In order to present meaningful reports, it is often necessary to discount future cash flows into a net present value. Any future cash flow will have a present value, which is determined by the time until the cash flow and the relevant interest rate.</p>
<p>The present value of any future cash flow is the sum that would need to be invested today at the relevant interest rate to ensure that future cash flow on the date in question.</p>
<p>The net present value (NPV) of a series of future cash flows is the sum of the present value of all those cash flows, whether they are positive or negative.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-standard-deviation">What is a standard deviation?</h3>
<p>A standard deviation provides a measure of the variability of a set of data. In the article on Value-at-Risk, we considered a portfolio of three assets, whose value varies from one observation period to another. In the article, we accepted measurements of both the standard deviation of all the assets and the correlation between them. This article shows how the standard deviations were calculated from the raw (or observed) data.</p>
<p>Over the previous ten observation periods, the value of the three assets increased by the proportions shown in Table 1.</p>

<p>The mean return is calculated by adding all the observed returns together and dividing the total by the number of observations (in this case 10). However, whilst the mean measures the average movement over the time period, it does not give any indication of the range of observations. This can be seen by contrasting the observations of Asset 1 and Asset 2. Asset 1 ranges from 8% to 14%, whereas Asset 2 ranges from 2% to 21% – however the means are only 10.6% and 12% respectively. Standard deviation gives a much clearer view of the volatility of the two assets.</p>
<h5>To calculate the standard deviation, use the following formula:</h5>

<p>Using the same formula, the S.D. for Asset 2 is 6.146% and for Asset 3 is 3.521%. Returning to our earlier point, the difference in the standard deviations between assets 1 and 2 gives us a much clearer indication as to the respective spreads of the observations detailed above.</p>
<p>If you use an Excel spreadsheet to record your data, you can use the STDEV formula to calculate the standard deviation. Assume the observations on Asset 1 are in column A, rows 1 to 10, in an Excel spreadsheet. To calculate the standard deviation, you would enter the following formula into a different square:</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Foreign exchange transactions that are settled ‘spot’ are (with the exception of USD/CAD trades) settled two working days after the trade is agreed. It is also possible to agree the trade of one currency for another to be settled at any point in the future. Any such transaction is referred to as a ‘forward outright’ transaction.</p>
<p>The forward exchange rate is a function of the spot rate and the interest rates on the two currencies. It is not based on price predictions at all.</p>
<p>By convention, currency pairs (e.g. GBP/USD) are quoted in the same way. The first named currency is known as the ‘base’ currency and the second the ‘variable’ currency.</p>

<p>To give a worked example, assume that a UK-based treasurer knows that the company will need dollars in one month’s time. The treasurer could enter into a spot agreement now and then put the dollars on deposit for a month. However, this means that these balances will be unavailable for a month. The alternative is to enter into a forward agreement with the settlement date in one month’s time. This has the effect of fixing the rate as of today’s spot rate, but it allows the treasurer to use that cash in the month up to settlement date.</p>
<aside>
<p>Note that in most cases the convention is that, in the currency pair, it is the USD that is quoted first and is, therefore, the base currency. The most common exceptions, apart from GBP/USD, are EUR/USD, AUD/USD and NZD/USD.</p>
</aside>
<p>Assume that the interest rate in the UK is 5.00% and in the US is 3.75% and the current spot rate is 1.422. GBP, as the first quoted currency is the base currency, and USD is the variable currency – this can be remembered as the spot rate quotes the number of dollars per £1.</p>

If UK interest rates are 10% and US interest rates are 5%, then in a year’s time the original £100 would be worth £110 and the $150 would be worth $157.50, so the effective forward rate then would be 1.43, a relative depreciation in sterling.</p>
<p>If rates were 5% in the UK and 10% in the US, then the USD would depreciate. The original £100 would be worth £105 and the $150 would be worth $165, an effective forward rate of 1.57.</p>
<p>This change in the interest rate provides compensation to the party buying the currency with the lower interest rate. Having bought the currency with the lower interest rate, the party will earn relatively less interest income than would have been the case had the foreign exchange trade not taken place. The compensation is that, in the future, relatively less of the lower interest rate currency will be required to purchase the same quantity of the higher interest rate currency.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>In last month’s issue, we started a two part process to calculate the price of an instrument on the secondary market. The price of a bond, or similar instrument, in the secondary market is equal to its present value. The present value is determined by the proceeds of the instrument at its maturity, the yield (interest rate) at the time that the instrument is sold in the secondary market and the time to maturity. Last month we showed how to calculate the maturity proceeds of the instrument. This month, we use that figure to calculate the present value, the price, of the instrument.</p>

<p>To give a worked example – assume a bond issued with a face value of £10m for 180 days with a final coupon payable at a rate of 6.5%. We found that the maturity proceeds of this instrument would be £10,320,547.95.</p>
<p>Using that figure, we can now calculate the price of the bond in the secondary market, assuming that there are 32 days until maturity when the current interest rate is 7%.</p>

		<title><![CDATA[What are the alternatives to the bank for financing?]]></title>
		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>In this series we have focussed on how to go about raising funds from banks, primarily in the form of overdrafts and loans. Whilst these are the most common sources of finance for the majority of companies, there are a wide variety of alternative sources of finance that are available, some or all of which may be appropriate for individual companies. The purpose of this article is to give an introduction to the wide range of alternative funding available to companies, which should illustrate the potential benefits from looking beyond the relationship bank to arrange finance.</p>
<p>When arranging finance for particular projects it is often both possible and desirable to raise that finance through the main relationship bank, either in the form of a loan or an overdraft. However, by clearly defining the purpose of raising finance, it can be possible to arrange the funding in a more appropriate, and cheaper, way. Some or all of the following methods of raising finance may be appropriate in particular circumstances for individual companies.</p>
<h3 id="supplier-credit-stock-finance">Supplier credit/Stock Finance</h3>
<p>Perhaps the easiest, and cheapest, way to arrange finance is to negotiate longer terms with your suppliers. At the very least, this will reduce your need to draw on what can be relatively expensive overdraft facilities. It is recognised that the use of trade credit varies from industry to industry. You will (or should!) know if this is a realistic option for your company.</p>
<h3 id="leasing-and-lease-purchase">Leasing and lease purchase</h3>
<p>Leasing and lease purchase (also known as hire purchase) is often used by companies to finance the use of plant, machinery, vehicles and computer equipment. In both cases, banks or other specialist providers will lend money to a company, using the asset that is being used or purchased as security for the debt. This practice is also known as asset based finance or ABF.</p>
<p>Leasing, where the lender keeps the ownership, and lease purchase, where the borrower purchases the asset ‘in instalments’, are common means of financing items for which there is a second-hand market, which gives the asset a value independent of the user.</p>

<h4 id="leasing">Leasing</h4>
<p>Under the terms of a lease, the ownership of the leased asset is kept by the lender. Broadly speaking, there are two types of lease – the finance lease and the operating lease. The finance lease requires the borrower to pay the asset’s capital costs and financial costs over the period of the lease. The initial (or primary) contract period is approximately equal to the asset’s life. The borrower usually has the option of extending the lease into a secondary period on payment of a minimal charge.</p>
<p>Under an operating lease, the lender will look to the residual value of the asset as a means of final repayment and so the lender is taking the residual value risk. The primary contract period is less than the asset’s life and so the lender will be seeking to add to its return by selling the asset at the end of the primary contract period.</p>
<p>Contract hire is a form of operational leasing, which often covers servicing or other running costs as a part of the lease.</p>
<p>At the moment, a finance lease is shown as an asset and a liability on the borrower’s balance sheet. An operating lease is treated as a revenue expense, and therefore is an ‘off-balance sheet’ expense with the lease commitments shown in the notes to the accounts. This may change as the accounting treatment of both finance and operational leases are currently under review by the Accounting Standards Board.</p>
<h4 id="lease-purchase">Lease purchase</h4>
<p>Lease purchase, also known as hire purchase, allows the borrower to obtain the ownership of the asset over time. Because the lease purchase agreement is a commitment to purchase, assets financed by lease purchase are shown as an asset a liability on the borrower’s balance sheet.</p>

<h3 id="factoring-and-invoice-discounting">Factoring and invoice discounting</h3>
<p>Factoring and invoice discounting are further forms of asset-based finance. Both forms of financing enable a company to ‘sell’ its debtors to the factor or the invoice discounter. The effect of both factoring and invoice discounting is to convert debtors into cash, irrespective of the agreed credit terms. In the case of factoring, the factor takes control of the company’s sales ledger as well. It could be said that the company outsources its credit control function to the factor.</p>

<h4 id="factoring">Factoring</h4>
<p>Under pure factoring, the factor will lend usually up to about 80% of sales value to the borrower in the form of a pre-payment on the strength of an invoice. The factor takes control of the sales ledger and collects all due payments. Once payments have been received, the factor will pay the balance of the purchase price, less any service charges, to the borrower.</p>
<p>If full payment is not received, then the borrower will re-assume responsibility for the debt after a specified period of time. In this case, the borrower may have to repay part of the pre-payment or to replace that uncollected with new debtors. Under a non-recourse factoring agreement, the borrower will not have to take responsibility for any debt caused by a debtor going bankrupt – in this case the factor will assume the risk.</p>
<h4 id="invoice-discounting">Invoice discounting</h4>
<p>Because factoring involves the borrower losing control of the sales ledger, the borrowing company may choose to raise funds from an invoice discounter instead. The principle of invoice discounting is the same as factoring – the invoice discounter lends the borrower up to about 80% of sales value in the form of a pre-payment. Unlike factoring, the borrower retains control of the sales ledger and is responsible for collecting payments, which are then deposited with the invoice discounter. Once all the payments are collected, the invoice discounter pays the balance of the purchase price less any discounting charges. The invoice discounter takes a larger credit risk than the factoring company, because the borrower retains control of the sales ledger. A company that wants to use the services of an invoice discounter will have to face significant scrutiny of its sales management process.</p>

<aside>
<h5 id="tt-tip">TT TIP</h5>
<p>Factoring and invoice discounting should be distinguished from those companies offering a sales ledger management process that is used to speed up collection and can reduce bad debts. This type of service does not provide any finance. Although it can be used alongside factoring, such a split is not always practical.</p>
</aside>
<p>As well as being a source of finance, factoring can also be used to protect against bad debts (this is known as non-recourse factoring) and to improve the quality of credit control procedures (this is particularly true for invoice discounting, where the invoice discounter will want to ensure that the company has sufficient controls in place).</p>
<p>Factors and invoice discounters are, like leasing companies, often subsidiaries of the clearing banks, but there are also a number of independent specialist companies.</p>
<p>Finance costs for factoring are typically the same as overdraft rates, with an additional factoring charge of between 0.25% and 2.75% of factored sales. This figure will depend on the nature of the service offered. Non-recourse factoring, where the factor pays the full sales price irrespective of whether all the debts are collected, will attract a higher fee than recourse factoring, where the factor can reclaim any prepayment uncovered by collected debts. In effect the factor and the invoice discounter will cover the cost of an increased risk by increasing their fee to you.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of both factoring and invoice discounting is that, whilst they may not be cheaper forms of finance than bank finance, they are potential new sources of finance for the company. This can be important when the relationship bank decides that it does not want to increase its exposure to you. However, you will have to ask your relationship bank’s permission to approach a factor or invoice discounter if your bank holds a floating charge (or a negative pledge) as this will include debtors.</p>

<h3 id="commercial-mortgages">Commercial mortgages</h3>
<p>Longer-term loans often take the form of commercial mortgages to provide finance for the purchase of business premises. These will be available through the relationship bank, but better terms can be found from specialist providers. These can be arranged over an extended period of time, normally up to as long as twenty-five years.</p>
<h3 id="equity-and-venture-capital">Equity and venture capital</h3>
<p>No analysis of sources of finance would be complete without a reference to sources of equity funding whether in the form of ordinary or preference shares or some form of debt that is subordinated to other lenders. It may be that more equity is required to balance other forms of debt or that bank or finance house borrowing is an inappropriate form of finance. The main sources of equity are venture capital, the public markets and private placements. Banks will often offer assistance in these markets but may lack the specialist expertise to obtain the best deal. They also lack independence when they have a specialist in-house supplier of the services that might be required.</p>
<p>There are 133 members of the British Venture Capital Association handling more than £5 billion a year in investments. Typically they lend and/or invest cash in return for an equity stake in the business. They are less concerned with interest returns than capital gains from the subsequent disposal of their stake. A venture capitalist looks for growth of 30 per cent per annum or more and, thus, seeks a strong management team capable of controlling the company.</p>
<h3 id="debt-issuance">Debt issuance</h3>
<p>The public markets are an alternative for the better-established company that is already, or is contemplating becoming, a public company. As the banks’ ability to lend will remain limited, the public debt markets are likely to grow in importance. Any medium- or larger sized company should monitor the developments in these markets. Not all banks have adequate experience available in these specialist areas. Advice should be sought from experienced advisers who specialise in the areas of most interest.</p>
<p>The private placement market also requires specialist advice from intermediaries who are able to identify and appropriate sources of finance. Private placements are not traded or listed; they are simply a private loan or equity arrangement between investors and individual companies.</p>
<p>This is also true of other specialist financing techniques whether it be advice on mergers or acquisitions (M&amp;A), management buy-outs (MBOs) or debt restructuring. No matter what the claims, the general banker has inadequate experience to advise in these areas.</p>
<h3 id="government-assistance">Government assistance</h3>
<p>There is a broad range of government schemes and assistance available to companies from all tiers of government from the European down to local authority. Some of the finance is in the form of loans and some in the form of grants. In general terms, grants do not have to be repaid, which seems attractive, but there are usually a number of strict conditions attached to any system of grant. In addition, the process of awarding grants, particularly for large sums, can take a number of months.</p>
<h5>For companies operating in England, this support comes for a variety of purposes:</h5>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Regional assistance.</h5>
<p>There are a number of grants available for companies to encourage them to relocate or stay in disadvantaged areas. These range from Regional Selective Assistance to Enterprise Grants. The European Structural Funds support projects that promote competitiveness throughout Europe. Details on these grants can be found from the English regional government offices (<a href="http://www.local-regions.detr.gov.uk/go/goindex.htm" target="_blank">www.local-regions.detr.gov.uk/go/goindex.htm</a>) and from the National Assembly for Wales, the Scottish Executive and the Northern Ireland Office. Similar schemes operate in all the other EU member states. Information about the European Union’s support for business can be found at <a href="http://www.cec.org.uk/pubs/notice.htm" target="_blank">www.cec.org.uk/pubs/notice.htm</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Support for research and development.</h5>
<p>Support from both the European Union and LINK is available to support research and development – more information at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/ost/link" target="_blank">www.dti.gov.uk/ost/link</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Support for small firms.</h5>
<p>Loan guarantees for small business can be got from, SMART awards are available to help businesses assess the way that they use technology. A network of Business Links around England is available to support small and medium-sized businesses. This support comes in the form of advice about both general business issues and how to get some of the listed grants. More information can be found at the Business Link website – <a href="http://www.businessadviceonline.org/businesslink" target="_blank">www.businessadviceonline.org/businesslink</a> – which is provided by the small business service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Support for training.</h5>
<p>There are a number of schemes available to enhance training programmes for employees both through the government’s New Deal programme <a href="http://www.newdeal.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.newdeal.gov.uk</a> and through Training and Education Councils <a href="http://www.tec.co.uk" target="_blank">www.tec.co.uk</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Support for exports.</h5>
<p>Both the Department of Trade and Industry and the Export Credits Guarantee Department provide a certain amount of assistance for exporting companies. More information can be found at <a href="http://www.tradepartners.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.tradepartners.gov.uk</a> and <a href="http://www.ecgd.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.ecgd.gov.uk</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="credit-and-corporate-purchasing-cards">Credit and corporate purchasing cards</h3>
<p>Purchasing cards might one day be seen as a replacement for petty cash but they are also a source of very short-term finance. These are credit cards geared towards business use. They are typically used to pay travel and entertainment expenses for company staff, or can be used to purchase supplies. While the bills for these expenses go unpaid they represent a form of finance.</p>
<p>Purchasing cards can be set up so that they are tied into particular suppliers. A member of a company can only use the card to purchase supplies or services from specific suppliers with a specific maximum value. More information on the use of corporate purchasing cards can be found in Treasury Today March 2000 and April 2000.</p>
<h3 id="get-the-right-mix">Get the right mix</h3>
<p>The purpose of this article is to indicate the broad range of alternative sources of finance that are available to companies. For most companies, the relationship bank will remain the most important single source of finance for their business. However, the use of alternative methods of finance for some parts of the business – for example, the use of leasing to fund a vehicle fleet – can reduce both the financial costs and the risks associated with the transaction. There is no one perfect solution, but most companies should be able to see significant advantages if they use the right mix of financing.</p>
<h3 id="in-summary">In summary</h3>
