<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The auditing industry, tasked with providing assurances on corporate information and reporting and giving confidence to the capital markets, is under fire for not doing its job properly. Audit firms have missed red accounting flags at an ever-growing list of corporate collapses, like retailer BHS in 2016, Carillion in 2018, Patisserie Valerie in 2019, German financial services group Wirecard and Greensill Capital in 2021. Against a challenging backdrop of evolutions in technology, changing business models and ESG integration, dissatisfaction with the industry that society relies on to inspect and challenge company accounts is at an all-time high.</p>
<p>It has led to ongoing and protracted calls for reform of the UK’s audit industry. In its latest manifestation, reforms include proposals to replace the Financial Reporting Council, the UK’s audit and accounting regulator, with a new watchdog with greater powers to police company directors, called the Audit Reporting and Governance Authority. Elsewhere, reform is expected to include the introduction of “managed shared audits”, requiring FTSE 350 companies audited by one of the Big Four to hand part of the work to smaller accounting firms to improve competition and impose extra governance requirements on companies.</p>
<p>Aside from painstakingly slow progress and legislation not slated until mid-2023 at the earliest, critics argue the reforms won’t address key challenges in the auditory process. For example, the conflict of interest inherent in auditors being contractors, paid by the companies they examine, remains unchallenged. “Audits are not independent,” says Prem Sikka, Professor Emeritus at University of Essex and University of Sheffield. “Companies appoint and renumerate their auditors in a fundamental flaw to the process that no proposals put forward by the government has thought to address.”</p>
<p>Secondly, reforms don’t address weaknesses in the International Accounting Standards used by auditors to oversee companies and which frequently mislead on corporate health, argues Tim Bush, Head of Governance and Financial Analysis PIRC Limited, the corporate governance and shareholder advisory consultancy. “International Accounting Standards aren’t fit for purpose. Until this is addressed, any technical reform is simply barking up the wrong tree.”</p>
<h4 id=""gloss-over"">Gloss over</h4>
<p>Treasury is closely involved in the audit process. Auditors rely on treasury to deliver well-supported and thought through cash forecasts, provide valuable insights into how the treasury function works; what systems the company has in place, valuations and the pension offering. Regulatory changes like the transition from LIBOR or knotty considerations around reverse factoring also bring auditors and treasury into close contact. Anecdotes from the frontline in one of the most complex touch points between auditors’ and treasury, hedge accounting, provide a snapshot of how auditors being in the pay of their corporate clients can go wrong.</p>
<p>Grappling with the complexity of hedge relationships is no easy task for audit teams while applicability – you cannot apply hedge accounting to every hedge relationship – and capturing and challenging fair values presented by the company is just as difficult. “Auditors will expect treasury to provide all hedge accounting documentation and data to support fair values and ask questions about why the company has put in place certain hedges,” explains David Passarinho, a treasury accounting expert at Huawei, who joined the global telecoms equipment maker from PwC’s Capital Markets and Accounting Advisory Services division to help Huawei develop a treasury accounting department to – amongst other things – support the audit.</p>
<p>Moreover, some accounting standards like IFRS, are principle rather than rules-based, giving leeway for interpretation. Companies may interpret information in a certain way, but it is incumbent on auditors to cast their own judgement and be sceptical, he says. “Auditors are aware of creative accounting and know bad management may use loopholes in their favour.”</p>
<p>Accounting firms have developed expert teams specialising in treasury to better get into the auditory weeds of hedge accounting and fair valuations. But crack teams of specialists deployed to deal with these complexities come at a price and sometimes auditors are reluctant to use them because the cost will push the price of the audit above the quote. It can lead to crucial red flags being missed, warns Passarinho. “Using specialist teams will increase the audit fees and could push them off budget. This can put the audit firm in danger of losing the audit unless the audit client understands the added-value of employing such specialists.”</p>
<p>It’s possible the problem of audit firms doing a lesser job to keep within budget is on the wane, given rising costs in the industry. The steady climb in audit fees in recent years – to the extent listed companies have experienced a fee increase of between 25-50% – suggests auditors are now pricing their work more accurately and charging more to audit complex transactions and intricate issues like hedge accounting.</p>
<p>Sikka doesn’t agree. High fees have been a characteristic of the industry long before the latest increase and should have more than enough for audit firms to deliver value and dive in deep, he argues. “I’ve seen invoices where audit partners are charged out at £1,500 an hour. When they say they need to be paid more, why can’t they deliver value for that kind of money?”</p>


<blockquote><p>On a like-for-like basis, audit fees have increased substantially because of the limited choice and competition in the market.</p>

<h4 id=""lack-of-competition"">Lack of competition</h4>
<p>For other industry insiders like David Herbinet, Head of Audit and Assurance at Mazars Group, the recent price hikes are less to do with auditors charging more for a better job and more symptomatic of another deep industry malice: an acute lack of competition. “On a like-for-like basis, audit fees have increased substantially because of the limited choice and competition in the market,” he says.</p>
<p>A gradual decline in the number of auditors over the last 20 years means that over 90% of listed UK companies are audited by just four firms – which also audit the vast majority of the world’s 500 largest companies. That tiny pool of choice evaporates even more when companies steer clear of a particular auditor because they are already consulting for the business in another capacity. “Most of the time, companies have a choice of just one of the big four which is just not satisfactory from a quality perspective given the lack of incentive and competition to perform,” says Herbinet.</p>
<p>European and UK policy makers have come up with a variety of strategies to try and break up the dominance of the big four and ensure different firms take on new relationships. Organising a tender for a new auditor is a complex and costly process that companies tend to avoid, but now European rules prevent auditor-corporate relationships stretching over decades with mandatory once-in-a-decade re-tender rules and requests companies change their auditor at least every 20 years.</p>
<p>Critics argue this doesn’t get to the heart of the problem. Mandatory rotation has led to a merry go round of the big four still winning the big deals and has done little to enhance choice. For Clive Bellingham, a partner at PwC for nearly 40 years and Vice President of ICAS, the professional body for chartered accountants, mandatory rotation also results in the loss of valuable knowledge accumulated over time and long-term relationships. “I’m personally not convinced audit firm rotation is the right answer.”</p>
<p>The UK’s latest reforms attempt to boost the number of audit firms competing for work in another approach. Under the proposals, challenger firms will team up on an audit with a Big Four name to help build skills and experience in a supported environment that also brings new teams into long-standing relationships. It could lead to an estimated 20% of aggregate FTSE350 audit fees going to challenger firms after five years and 30% after seven years.</p>
<h4 id=""esg"">ESG</h4>
<p>Climate change reporting could shake up the market. Companies the world over have made net zero claims and corporate reporting on sustainability and climate preparedness needs auditing to protect against greenwashing. Rather than give more work to the existing cohort, auditing ESG statements and accounts could be an opportunity to attract new players into the market. The European Union is currently considering prohibiting the audit of financial statements being conducted by the same firm auditing ESG reports.</p>
<p>It’s an approach that has divided opinion about whether it will complicate or facilitate an already challenging process. For example, auditing ESG accounts includes number crunching gaps like the timeframe companies use for calculating future cashflows tallying with their timeframe for <a href=""/regulation-and-standards/standards/treasury-gets-to-grips-with-scope-3-ttia"">emission reductions</a> – given the latter’s impact on cash flows.</p>
<h4 id=""collective-response"">Collective response</h4>
<p>It looks likely that the reform process will usher in more pressure on other stakeholders to verify company accounts in a collective response. Auditors argue they don’t have the powers of police or regulators and cannot be held solely responsible for poor internal corporate governance – corporate boards need to grasp their own risk management responsibilities and ensure the resilience of the business. Almost two-thirds of auditors believe the UK’s corporate governance code should give directors greater responsibility for promoting, monitoring and assessing their corporate culture, according to a poll by the Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors.</p>
<p>Although more far-reaching proposals modelled on the US’s Sarbanes-Oxley Act which require directors to sign off on companies’ internal controls over financial reporting have been dropped, calls are growing for management and boards to take more responsibility for the preparation of financial statements. It means the role of treasury, with its view on cash and early warning signals of corporate trauma, will come to the fore. “Auditors operate in an ecosystem where governance is key. It is important to ensure enough is being done from a governance perspective by the board and other stakeholders,” says Herbinet.</p>
<p>But the ability of treasury to do more leads PRICS’ Bush to highlight the original problem of the current reform process: treasury’s unique position to facilitate and support the audit process is stymied by current International Accounting Standards. Treasury is in pole position to help ensure corporate health and raise red flags, but treasury expertise has been squeezed out of the audit process, he says. “Sub-standard accounting models based on market value have squeezed out the basic tenets of treasury management focused on how a company has been, and is, funded,” he concludes.</p>

<p>Matthew Rose, Director of Tax, Treasury and Investor Relations at De La Rue. He writes here in a personal capacity and the views expressed are his own.</p>
<p>The impact of the potential reform might not be that significant for UK companies. A UK parent company with a subsidiary outside the UK is already subject to Controlled Foreign Company rules whereby if the subsidiary hasn’t paid a certain level of tax – which the UK defines as three quarters of the UK tax rate and which is already around the 15% suggested by the G7 – the UK parent company may already have to effectively top up that tax in the UK.</p>
<p>From the UK perspective, it might not be that big a change, although whether the existing “gateways” and exemptions or even long-standing international tax treaties may survive unscathed is yet to be seen. After the next G20 meeting we expect some indications of how this may develop. There will undoubtedly be political choices for countries to make.</p>
<p>Under existing OECD proposals known as “Pillar Two” rules, any extra corporate or withholding taxes might only apply to companies with a worldwide turnover of €750m or above. It might be that groups under this threshold may also not be subject to the full force of the future reform. Companies need to stay alert to see if the reform applies to subsidiaries of all sizes and if it does, as per indications from the G7, how it relates to the margins that each subsidiary makes. For example, you can have subsidiaries with low revenue but large margins or with large revenues making low margins. It may be that not all the rules bite, so treasury and finance need to work closely with tax teams.</p>
<p>Companies should look at the entire flow or chain of their profits and taxes too. For example, some territories may have low taxes on profits but then they have high taxes when it comes to trying to extract profits out of the country. Under the new rules if introduced, some countries may choose to increase their headline tax rate because they won’t want another country to obtain any amount above their headline rate up to the 15% or whatever level is finally selected.</p>
<p>Companies also need to understand the existing but expanding rules around country-by-country reporting. Many companies with a turnover of €750m or above may already have to send a detailed breakdown of each of their subsidiaries’ results by country to their parent company’s tax authority – like in the UK. Under the new rules, this may become a requirement for many more companies.</p>
<p>Treasury teams should prepare for the likelihood that companies will pay more tax but be aware that not every country will bring in the same rules at the same time. Whilst some initial responsibility will fall to tax teams because treasury and tax are usually sister departments and have direct reporting lines to the CFO, the impact will spread to treasury, especially if there is more pressure on company cash flows and payments, or if there are different ways required to satisfy tax authorities with any bonds or guarantees. More proactive treasury teams should already be thinking about what additional cash headroom they may need in the future.</p>

<p>There has been a history of inward investment into Ireland since the 1950s and tax has always been an element driving that investment. However, in recent years the model has shifted to Ireland drawing investment, particularly around research and development, because of our sophisticated skills and innovation base. Tax is still an element, but much less so than what it was in the past. We offer high quality skills; we are a gateway to the European labour market, and we have developed specialisations and sectors of excellence.</p>
<p>If Ireland’s 12.5% tax rate is increased, the non-tax elements of our offering will become even more important. This means our physical infrastructure, particularly our digital and housing infrastructure, will be key to drawing investment as well as our skills and talent base. We have real ambition on our non-tax offering and a determination to deliver the best ecosystem we can, ensuring Ireland is a great place for firms to locate.</p>
<p>There is still a lot of technical work to be done to determine what the new global minimum rate would be, including recognition for research and development incentives and other potential carve outs of the model. There is a direction and consensus building around a 15% rate and 15% is not materially different from our current regime of 12.5%.</p>
<p>We view the change as an opportunity. We are no longer the upstart we were previously. We have the substance and scale to attract businesses and if there is a level playing field that prevents other jurisdictions from competing on an aggressive tax base it could be to our advantage. Moreover, Ireland will continue to offer a stable tax offering. Tax certainty will matter, and Ireland will bring that in spades.</p>
<p>There are also challenges in the changes, however. The Pillar One reform, designed to re-allocate some taxing rights to market jurisdictions will impact Ireland. The reallocation of tax bases to be more consumption based is not good for small, open economies with a large export market and a small domestic market. If the reforms do lead to re-allocating more of the tax base to other jurisdictions, that will cost our Exchequer. I think there should be a recognition of the business models of small exporting countries.</p>

<p>Most companies in Ireland are already factoring in some increase in effective tax rates and the reform will have an impact on how companies structure themselves. The framework needs certainty and full agreement at OECD levels and IBEC is following these developments closely. Although it’s too early to make significant long-term decisions and anticipate what the implications are for Ireland’s tax regime, the trend is clear: there is a momentum behind global tax coordination and minimum corporation tax rates.</p>
<p>From a treasury’s perspective, the biggest impact will be cash flow management. When a tax liability arises, companies must comply and make payment within statutory deadlines that can’t be delayed. Therefore, treasury must have cash on hand. This means compliance issues could arise where multinational companies have tax liabilities in jurisdictions where they currently don’t have a physical presence or pay taxes.</p>
<p>Historically, companies have based their investment decisions on a range of factors including taxation matters. With increased tax costs, this consideration has become more important. The rules will also be complex: even calculating if a company is above or below the proposed minimum rate will be complicated. The challenge lies at the tax administration level and there may be a struggle in dealing with this piece of new global legislation.</p>
<p>As of 1st July 2021, 130 countries have backed global tax rules that will affect the largest multinational corporations in the world, on top of a 15% global minimum corporate tax. These updates, expected to take effect by 2023, will mean sweeping changes across the global taxation landscape.</p>
<h4 id=""view-from-the-us"">View from the US</h4>
<p>President Biden’s Green Book (the administration’s fiscal year 2022 revenue proposals released in May), included a proposal to tax the largest 120 companies at 15% of their book income. The approximately 120 companies subjected to the minimum tax are those with net income over US$2bn. It is unclear how this provision will work or how it will be implemented if the OECD agrees to a compromise to eliminate digital service taxes imposed on US multinationals. The US is against unilateral digital services taxes imposed by other countries and continues to support tariffs in response to digital taxes.</p>
<p>The Green Book also included provisions that are affected by switching to the OECD global minimum tax if approved. It suggests an increase to the Global Intangible Low Tax Income (GILTI) rate to 21% and proposes a new provision known as SHIELD (Stopping Harmful Inversions and Ending Low-tax Developments). Both penalise entities within a related party structure that have an income tax rate below 21%.</p>
<p>The US wants a global minimum tax to avoid higher taxes on US parented multinationals. Biden’s proposal includes a 28% federal US corporation tax rate. The added state income taxes and the combined effective US tax rate sums up to 30%, while the OECD suggests a global tax of 15%. This means that US companies can still cut their taxes in half if they move earnings outside the US.</p>
<p>We expect the proposed tax changes to encourage more mergers and acquisitions for companies to align their structures with the benefits of having earnings outside of the US. We may also see the largest 120 multinational enterprises spin off parts of their business to fall below the US$2bn net income threshold.</p>

<p><em>IFRS 16 is the new accounting standard that requires companies to include operating leases on their balance sheets. Since it came into force on 1<sup>st</sup> January this year, what has been its impact and how have treasurers been getting involved?</em></p>
<p>There can be few regulations that don’t have at least one downside. The IFRS 16 lease accounting standard brings transparency to the balance sheet but, for most finance functions, is a source of rather a lot of extra work.</p>
<p>The underlying assets of finance leases have always been reported on balance sheet. The new regulation, which applies to all listed firms with accounting periods ending on or after 1st January 2019, requires operating leases to now be recorded on balance sheet. The statistics in 2016 showed that listed companies had US$3.3trn of lease commitments of which 85% or US$2.8trn were probably off balance sheet then.</p>
<p>Previously, under IAS 17, operating leases could be reported in notes to the accounts of the financial statement as ‘lease commitments’, and even then, only as an imprecise contractual amount; future exercised lease options, for example, were excluded.</p>
<p>The main rating agencies have been incorporating adjusted lease impact for many years, treating off balance sheet operating leases as if they were on balance sheet. However, most other stakeholders could not accurately assess a company’s debt if it was not on the balance sheet. IFRS 16 effectively eliminates the difference between operating leases and finance leases for lessees (though not lessors). It is a rule intended to create transparency for investors, lenders and analysts, giving them greater precision when comparing companies in the same industry or rating category.</p>
<h4 id=""impact"">Impact</h4>
<p>The annual Corporate Debt and Treasury Report issued by international law firm, Herbert Smith Freehills, notes that where IFRS 16 applies, even though it has no cash impact on companies, the effect is that “lessees will appear to have more assets but also more debt”.</p>
<p>Although in the financial services sector it does not necessarily form a material balance (one that could influence the economic decisions of report users), the same cannot be said in the corporate space, where lease numbers can be immense.</p>
<p>Indeed, as a result of that vastness, some corporates chose to be early adopters of the IFRS 16 full retrospective model. This requires them to calculate every single lease to try to reduce the P&amp;L impact. They are effectively restating figures at year-end, as if IFRS 16 had always been applied; the other option – the modified retrospective approach – means comparative figures are not restated to reflect the adoption of IFRS 16, but then the figures appear massively skewed.</p>
<p>IFRS 16 is far-reaching. Approximately 120 nations and reporting jurisdictions permit or require IFRS for domestic listed companies. Of these, around 90 countries have fully conformed with IFRS requirements. Where IFRS 16 has not been directly adopted (in the US, for example), a version that follows it closely will usually have been subsumed into domestic GAAP (US GAAP is broadly the same but does have some key differences with IFRS, particularly in relation to the application of discount rate and the exclusion of the low value exemption in the US).</p>
<p>Obviously, the sectors that have depended more on operating leases, will be most affected by IFRS 16, especially where price of debt is linked to amount of debt. The likes of consumer and retail, telecommunications, transportation, and energy (especially oil and gas) now have their work cut out to maintain compliance. With a retailer such as UK supermarket Tesco citing upwards of 9,000 leases, that effort is significant.</p>
<p>Some corporates have retained pre-IFRS 16 treatment of operating leases in their bank facility agreements. This is the so-called ‘frozen GAAP’ provision that allows the use of accounting principles active when a facility was entered into, thus not requiring adherence to principles that follow, such as IFRS 16. These companies have a degree of protection for a while, but may have to reconcile pre- and post-IFRS 16 figures for covenant compliance purposes.</p>
<p>The challenge here, according to the Herbert Smith Freehills report, “will be for borrowers to agree with lenders the required flexibility for permissions baskets, ratios and related definitions in their bank financings as well as to solve the issue more generally for their floating GAAP financings”.</p>


<blockquote><p>What’s also particularly interesting to CFOs and CEOs – and shareholders – is the impact that the implementation of IFRS 16 has on EPS too; it is dilutive for EPS because interest charges on leases tend to be higher in the early years, hitting earnings per share initially but becoming EPS accretive at the end of a lease when interest charges are less.</p></blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">Simon Lello, Managing Director UK Corporate Banking, MUFG</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The implication, in part, is that companies that are weaker on the ratings spectrum, or without frozen GAAP protection, will have less negotiating power with their banks around tweaking covenants. Indeed, with IFRS 16 in force, banks could start insisting that covenants are increased to include the operating leases now sitting on their clients’ balance sheets.</p>
<p>Where ladder pricing is used on loans (greater debt equals higher pricing), the sudden increase in booked debt could see pricing increase significantly, perhaps as much as threefold, notes Simon Lello, Managing Director UK Corporate Banking, MUFG.</p>
<p>However, because lease liabilities now have to be calculated precisely, with each and every lease modelled using a particular borrowing rate as an assumption, he adds that there have been “some happy outcomes” in terms of that liability being a little bit less than expected. For others though, it has gone the wrong way.</p>
<p>Typically, a company will have to compute an incremental borrowing rate (IBR), being the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow over a similar term and with a similar security the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use assets in a similar economic environment. Alternatively, lease payments can be discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. Treasurers are well placed to opine and advise on all this within their companies.</p>
<h4 id=""treasury-role"">Treasury role</h4>
<p>As part of the preparation for IFRS 16, treasury would have seen the need to put in place robust financial frameworks around the new measure. A basic principle of corporate governance is that companies are subject to restrictions in their memorandum and articles of association in terms of overall borrowing powers, says Lello. “Clearly there was need in every case to check that suddenly having a large number of leases coming onto the balance sheet would not breach that borrowing power.”</p>
<p>There was a lot of work done behind the scenes at most big users of lease debt as they sought to amend agreements, governance and build mechanisms to track compliance. The discussion now, notes Lello, is for any new leases to be evaluated in a similar light as for any other new debt obligation.</p>
<p>Treasurers will also now be looking at the economics of lease transactions, rather than primarily as an accounting ‘solve’ for getting debt off the balance sheet. Indeed, notes Lello, some companies are now more closely comparing the cost of a lease debt with a bond issuance, private placements or bank loans.</p>
<p>A side effect of the new standard is that IFRS 16 is dilutive to EPS at the beginning of a lease and accretive to EPS at the end of a lease as interest charged is higher in the earlier years and reduces over time.</p>
<p>Anecdotal evidence from Lello suggests some treasurers have been “surprised” by some of the high costs of lease debt seen, particularly looking further down the curve in terms of lease size (for example for vehicles, plant and equipment). A silver lining of IFRS 16 is that it presents an opportunity for companies to explore, through the necessary high degree of precision and granularity required to compute IFRS 16 calculations, a data set capable of comparing the relative cost of lease obligations. There is a cost saving opportunity for treasurers who now cast a more critical eye over lease contracts and can promote productive “internal discussions to optimise cost efficiency of now on balance sheet lease debt”.</p>
<p>Due to their skill sets and financing, treasurers have been key players in helping to communicate the balance sheet and profit impact of IFRS 16 both to internal and external stakeholders. Primarily treasurers have been interacting with banks and rating agencies but, they have also been “well-placed” to explain the recalculation of leases more widely, says Lello.</p>
<p>“Treasurers find themselves very much in the box-seat following the introduction of IFRS 16, and this has triggered more regular reporting,” he notes. Whereas before, lease liabilities were typically calculated at the time of the annual and semi report, there is now a continuous testing. Indeed, it is not just a question of increased debt now, it is also a matter of handling raised EBITDA metrics, used to measure a company’s operating performance: this has to be assessed at least quarterly, explains Lello.</p>
<p>“What’s also particularly interesting to CFOs and CEOs – and shareholders – is the impact that the implementation of IFRS 16 has on EPS too; it is dilutive for EPS because interest charges on leases tend to be higher in the early years, hitting earnings per share initially but becoming EPS accretive at the end of a lease when interest charges are less.” This has all had to be articulated carefully to shareholders. Some industries (airlines, retailers) are much more impacted than others.</p>
<h4 id=""whats-involved"">What’s involved?</h4>
<p>Calculations are not always straightforward. They are divided into two parts, with an interest expense and a depreciation charge; it is not something for the inexperienced. The role of the treasury is significant as both an advisor to the business, and as a source of information around new leases taken on and the existing portfolio.</p>
<p>In the calculation of IFRS 16, a discounting formula is used, explains Charlotte Lo, Director, Banking Accounting Advisory Services, KPMG UK. The recognition of assets and liabilities is based on the “relatively simple” idea of discounted cash flow (DCF). DCF calculates the present value of future cash flow, applying a discount because present value is always lower than the cash flow future value.</p>
<p>In this context, a discount rate determines the present value of a lease payment as a measure of the firm’s lease liability. Lease payments can be discounted using either the interest rate implicit in the lease (IRIL) or, more likely, the firm’s incremental borrowing rate (IBR).</p>
<p>Calculating the present value of DCF thus first requires collation of all lease details, including any intentions to exercise options (such as an extension). A discount rate can then be generated, but because leases vary in tenor and the rate represents a specific period only (a ten-year rate cannot be used for a five-year lease calculation, for example) this has to be accounted for. Similarly, where different currencies are used across contracts – and large MNCs may use many – rate calculation requires considerably more work.</p>
<p>Where IBR is used to calculate the discount rate, a market rate such as LIBOR, or another risk free rate (such as SONIA), could be used, says Lo. But this then needs to be adjusted, taking into account the credit risk of the lessee, the lease tenor, the underlying value of the asset, the amount ‘borrowed’ by the lessee, and even the economic environment in which the lease is active (and this may include country and currency).</p>
<p>“It is not easy to come up with the discount rate, but the treasurer can help by providing the risk-free rate and the credit risk of the entity, and they can help source the borrowing rate,” she says. “For that, treasury may be considered one of the key functions to supply inputs of IFRS 16 calculations.”</p>
<p>Of course, every time a batch of new leases comes through, when a new contract is signed for example, a new rate must be secured. Some firms may refresh rates periodically, say every quarter, says Lo, “so it is important that the auditor accepts these rates”.</p>
<p>She believes that treasury can take a more proactive stance here, establishing a self-service model. “In the past, treasury did not necessarily make these rates available but I think there now needs to be a process where it publishes rates from which all internal group companies can source.”</p>
<p>However, Lo offers anecdotal evidence (from the banking sector) revealing that treasurers were initially surprised that IFRS 16 is their problem. “There has been an initial reluctance to incorporate IFRS 16 as part of their processes and controls,” she recounts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some have been unwilling to offer rates “other than for a few core currencies”. This is unhelpful if the finance department then has to agree with auditors how proxy rates are to be used. In its defence, Lo fully accepts that the additional burden on treasury has come as “an unpleasant shock” to some.</p>
<h4 id=""next-steps"">Next steps</h4>
<p>IFRS 16 demands a complex data exchange. For a business with thousands of leases to manage, it will need “more than a spreadsheet” to manage, suggests Lo. To create a useful system, many processes and data flows must be incorporated, including those of treasury.</p>
<p>Although third-party systems are available, allowing journal entries to be created at asset or contract level before uploading into a SAP or Oracle general ledger, it is evident to Lo that manual processes persist.</p>
<p>To overcome this (and many other issues), companies need to be aiming for data centralisation and process automation, with the treasurer a guiding force, looking at the different lease rates across the enterprise. From here, the outliers can more easily be called out – lease rates that seem high, for example – and replaced with other forms of debt, a more economical lease, or even purchase of equipment.</p>
<p>Post-IFRS 16 many companies still have work to do in resetting their covenant packages, notes Lello. The treasurer now has a key role to play, acting as “independent arbiter” to evaluate whether leasing is ultimately a cost-competitive source of ‘finance’. Indeed, he adds, IFRS 16 has ensured treasury now has an additional area in which to be the “expert advisor” to the business.</p>


<h4 id=""the-essence-of-ifrs-16-for-treasurers"">The essence of IFRS 16 for treasurers</h4>
<p>Michael Keeler, CEO of LeaseAccelerator, suggests some key IFRS 16 action points for treasurers:</p>
<p><strong>Expect increased auditor scrutiny.</strong> The new rules will result in greater auditor scrutiny over companies’ leasing processes and controls, so companies will need to track their leases more closely than in the past.</p>
<p><strong>Monitor financial ratios.</strong> IFRS 16 will impact financial ratios including the leverage ratio, return on assets, and current ratio which could impact agency ratings, existing debt covenants and future debt arrangements.</p>
<p><strong>Improve data management.</strong> Leases will need to be tracked more closely under the new rules, so robust data management will be essential.</p>
<p><strong>Assist accounting</strong> in determining the incremental borrowing rate or discount rate to use for calculating the present value of the lease payments. Also, accounting will need help in capturing key financial variables, including weighted average cost of capital (WACC).</p>
<p><strong>Advise on long-term processes, policies and controls.</strong> Treasury can help develop sourcing policies to optimise capital use in the leasing programme. One control could be requiring a lease-versus-buy analysis for every asset request to ensure that the best acquisition decision is made.</p>
<p><strong>Develop long-term lessor relationships.</strong> As the leasing process becomes more visible, relationships with a company’s vendors and landlords will become more important. Strong relationships with lessors will give advantages in the sourcing data and in the negotiation processes for equipment and real estate assets.</p>
<p><strong>Keep financial metrics up-to-date – and share them.</strong> Treasurers can establish an internal process for their organisation to ensure that they keep financial metrics relevant to the leasing programme up-to-date in the organisation’s lease administration software. These data points include the company’s incremental borrowing rate and current market rates.</p>

<p><em>IFRS 16 is coming – and with the new accounting standards expected to bring trillions of dollars of assets onto balance sheets around the world, treasurers need to be prepared. What steps should treasurers be taking, and which challenges should they be aware of?</em></p>
<p>The new IFRS 16 lease accounting standards are due to come into force on 1<sup>st</sup> January 2019. Expected to bring over US$2.8trn of assets onto balance sheets around the world, the new rules will have a significant impact on IFRS and US GAAP reporting firms, affecting everything from financial metrics to debt covenants. So what are the implications for corporate treasurers – and what should you be doing to prepare?</p>
<h3 id=""why-change-the-rules"">Why change the rules?</h3>
<p>In a nutshell, IFRS 16 Leases is being introduced to address criticisms of the current lease accounting requirements in IAS 17 Leases, as Victor Chan, International Director, Ernst &amp; Young GS LLP, Professional Practice – IFRS Services group, explains. He notes that the current requirements have been criticised for failing to meet the needs of users of the financial statements – “particularly because IAS 17 does not require lessees to recognise assets and liabilities arising from operating leases”. In contrast, IFRS 16 “addresses those criticisms by requiring lessees to recognise most leases on their balance sheets and providing enhanced disclosures”.</p>
<p>While the new rules were published in 2016, the history of IFRS 16 dates back a number of years. “The standard was introduced as a response to the financial scandals of the early 2000s,” explains Michael Keeler, CEO of LeaseAccelerator. He says that the IASB began investigating loopholes in the accounting standards that could potentially allow for accounting fraud – and that one of the biggest loopholes discovered by the IASB was that of off-balance sheet operating leases.</p>
<p>“Under the old lease accounting standard, IAS 17, leases classified as operating leases (rather than finance leases) could be reported in the footnotes of financial statements,” Keeler says. “As a result, operating lease liabilities were omitted from a corporation’s total liabilities. While professional financial analysts have always had their own methods of calculating a corporation’s true liabilities, the average retail investor was typically left in the dark.”</p>
<p>IFRS 16 closes this loophole by eliminating the difference between operating leases and finance leases. “Now, all leases, with limited exceptions for short-term and low-value leases, will be treated as finance leases and reported on the balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability,” says Keeler. </p>


<h2 class=""h3 copy__heading"">Finance lease vs operating lease</h2>

<p>Under IAS 17, lessees treated finance leases and operating leases differently:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <strong>finance lease</strong> is one which transfers substantially the risks and rewards relating to ownership to the lessee. For example, this would include a lease in which ownership of the asset is transferred to the lessee at the end of the lease term. Under the previous rules, finance leases were recognised as a liability on the balance sheet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In an <strong>operating lease</strong>, the risks and rewards remain with the lessor. Under the previous rules, operating leases had no balance sheet impact.</p><p><br/><br/></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Under IFRS 16, both types of lease will be accounted for using a single, on-balance sheet accounting model. Lessors, however, will continue to differentiate between finance and operating leases.</p>
<p>The new rules do not require lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for short-term leases of 12 months or less, or for leases of low-value assets.</p>



<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h3 id=""whats-changing"">What’s changing?</h3>
<p>Keeler describes IFRS 16 as “one of the biggest accounting standards changes in history”. Indeed, the IASB estimates that over US$2trn of leases will move onto the balance sheet following the changes – and that half of all listed companies currently using IAS 17 or FAS 13 will be affected by the changes.</p>
<p>Chan points out that when the new leases standard becomes effective, an entity’s financial statements “may look quite different”, depending on the significance of its leasing activities. Where the balance sheet is concerned, Chan explains that IFRS 16 requires lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for most leases.</p>
<p>“Specifically, leases are accounted for based on a ‘right-of-use model’,” he says. “The model reflects that, at the commencement date, a lessee has a financial obligation to make lease payments to the lessor for its right to use the underlying asset during the lease term.” As Chan points out, this is a significant difference from the current lease accounting requirements in IAS 17 for operating leases that are off balance sheet.</p>
<p>Also significant is the impact on the income statement. An Effects Analysis published by IFRS in 2016 explains that for companies with material off balance sheet leases, IFRS 16 “changes the nature of expenses related to those leases”, replacing the previous straight-line operating lease expense with a depreciation charge for the lease asset and an interest expense on the lease liability. The document explains that “Although the depreciation charge is typically even, the interest expense reduces over the life of the lease as lease payments are made,” which results in a reducing total expense as an individual lease matures.</p>
<p>The Effects Analysis does note that the difference in the expense profile between IFRS 16 and IAS 17 is expected to be insignificant for companies holding a portfolio of leases that start and end in different reporting periods.</p>
<h3 id=""implications-for-treasurers"">Implications for treasurers</h3>
<p>For corporate treasurers, the new standards bring a number of possible implications including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Increased auditor scrutiny.</h5>
<p>The new rules will result in greater auditor scrutiny over companies’ leasing processes and controls, so companies will need to track their leases more closely than in the past.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Financial ratios.</h5>
<p>IFRS 16 is expected to impact financial ratios including the leverage ratio, return on assets, and current ratio which could impact agency ratings, existing debt covenants, and future debt arrangements. Keeler says that the effect on each company will vary – “so treasury should research and confirm how these metrics will change when the standard is implemented.”</p>

<h5>Data management.</h5>
<p>Leases will need to be tracked more closely under the new rules, so robust data management will be essential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Lessor relationships.</h5>
<p>Keeler also points out that treasury often takes on the role of managing lessor relationships, which will be important under the new standards as a source of lease data “that companies need to track, but may not currently have access to.” He points out that maintaining these relationships may allow companies easier access to this data in the future – “and potentially advantages in negotiation.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Keeler adds that achieving greater visibility into companies’ leasing programmes can bring opportunities for treasurers to identify unnecessary costs. He notes that many companies have uncovered inefficiencies in their sourcing – “either from not conducting a lease versus buy analysis, or not competitively sourcing assets.” He also says that end-of-term management can be associated with inefficiencies if companies do not stop payments on leases in a timely manner.</p>

<p>As a treasurer you are responsible for daily liquidity and compliance to debt covenants, which is where IFRS 16 will have an implication. So we’re currently working on getting that secured.</p>
<p>IFRS 16 will also lead to certain efforts at work that will probably be demanded from your department in relation to the discount rate, for example – this is a number that probably comes from the treasury teams in order to assist the group accounting and reporting departments.</p>
<p>In fact, the group accounting and reporting departments are the ones who are leading this project here at Wolters Kluwer, although we do of course have a role to play. They are preparing various discussion papers and organising webinars to inform the whole group internally about the changes.</p>
<p>We are also seeing a new data collection effort for the different kinds of contracts, including real estate contracts as well as car leases – every car is a new contract in itself, so there are a high number of leases that will need to be evaluated. Another thing for us is looking at IT data centres and assessing whether such contracts include leases or not.</p>
<p>You can imagine that this is quite an undertaking – first of all getting the information from your business, but also the interactions with auditors, rating agencies and banks. Luckily we have acquired our own software provider, Tagetik, a leading global provider of corporate performance management software and services, which can help organisations get their lease requirements into their systems more effectively. So it’s a great opportunity to use our own products.</p>
<p>As it relates to liquidity, I would say it’s better to arrange this over the summer – don’t wait until the moment when you’re actually in need of your credit facility, but do it right now while it’s still relatively early days.</p></img>

<h3 id=""what-should-treasurers-be-doing"">What should treasurers be doing?</h3>
<p>Naturally, the first step for treasurers is to understand the requirements under the new leases standards. “Compared with the existing accounting standard on leases, there is detailed guidance under IFRS 16 on the definition of a lease, identifying and separating lease and non-lease components, recognition and measurement of lease liability, and the right-of-use asset on initial and subsequent accounting, as well as presentation and disclosure requirements,” says Chan.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Achieving greater visibility into companies’ leasing programmes can bring opportunities for treasurers to identify unnecessary costs.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He adds that the second step should be to evaluate how the new leases standard would impact the financial statements both of the entity and of its peers, including the impact on financial ratios and credit profile. “Corporate treasurers also need to ensure that banks and other lenders understand the impact of IFRS 16,” he adds, pointing out that it may be necessary to negotiate revised covenants with lenders if the impact from the implementation of IFRS 16 will be significant.</p>
<p>The final step, Chan says, should be to evaluate how the new leases standard would impact the financial statements of the entity’s customers, and to update the entity’s model and process for evaluating the creditworthiness of its customers.</p>
<h3 id=""overcoming-the-challenges"">Overcoming the challenges</h3>
<p>Treasurers should be aware of the challenges that may arise while adopting the new standard. Chan says that implementing IFRS 16 may require a closer look at the new standard’s transition provisions. “For example, the standard allows for transition fully retrospectively or using a modified retrospective approach (with various practical expedients) that does not recast prior years,” he explains. “Therefore, comparing financial statements may require carefully considering the transition-related disclosures to understand the impact of the new leases standard across a sector.”</p>
<h4 id=""data-capture"">Data capture</h4>
<p>Keeler observes that data capture is considered to be the largest challenge, noting that corporations will need to capture up to 100 data fields per lease, including information on payments, expenses and end-of-term options.</p>
<p>This may be not be a straightforward exercise, as Keeler explains: “At many large organisations, this data is scattered around systems, spreadsheets and file cabinets in different business units and cost centres around the world,” he says. “Some of the information may not even exist in the corporation’s records.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Corporate treasurers also need to ensure that banks and other lenders understand the impact of IFRS 16.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a result, Keeler says that the project team is unlikely to focus on establishing long-term processes or controls, such as a lease versus buy analysis, or on optimising the use of capital and maintaining lessor relationships. “It will be up to treasury to explain the importance of these policies to the leasing programme and the company as a whole,” he notes.</p>
<p>According to Keeler, this could include pointing out that a lease versus buy analysis control “not only helps optimise the use of capital, but also serves as a data capture point which can be used to prove completeness of lease data in an audit”.</p>
<h4 id=""positive-lessor-relationships"">Positive lessor relationships</h4>
<p>Finally, maintaining positive relationships with lessors can provide another way of tracking down lease data. Whereas many companies do not have access to all the data fields they need to properly complete the accounting under the new standard, Keeler points out that lessors “have built their business off tracking this information”. He adds, “having a strong relationship with the lessors will allow the treasury group to reach out, should there be a question about a lease or a missing data field.”</p>


<h2 class=""h3 copy__heading"">Taking action</h2>
Where specific actions are concerned, Keeler suggests a number of steps that corporate treasurers should take in the time leading up to the implementation deadline:
<ol>
<li>
<p>Help accounting develop a methodology for determining the Incremental borrowing rate or discount rate to use for calculating the present value of the lease payments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assist accounting with capturing key financial variables, including Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Share the information that treasury has on file about the lease portfolio, including which assets are leases, the lessors, and the asset owners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leverage relationships with leasing companies to get the latest copies of leases or other critical data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advise on long-term processes, policies, and controls for the future state design of the leasing programme:</p><ol style=""list-style-type: lower-alpha;"">
<li>
<p>Establish sourcing policies to optimise capital use in the leasing programme. One control could be requiring a lease versus buy analysis for every asset request to ensure that the best acquisition decision is made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop long-term lessor relationships. As the leasing process becomes more visible, relationships with a company’s vendors and landlords will become more important. Strong relationships with lessors will give the company advantages in the sourcing and negotiation processes for equipment and real estate assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep financial metrics up-to-date. Treasury can establish an internal process for their organisation to ensure that they keep financial metrics relevant to the leasing programme up-to-date in the organisation’s lease administration software. These data points include the company’s incremental borrowing rate and current market rates.</p>

</ol>

<h5 id=""pieter-sermeus-zanders"">Pieter Sermeus, Senior Treasury and Risk Consultant, Zanders:</h5>
<p>With the mandatory implementation deadline of 1st January 2018 less than six months from now, the impact of IFRS 9 should not be underestimated. The standard significantly changes the accounting of financial instruments which can directly impact the P&amp;L and balance sheet. The role of the treasurer may be larger than expected, as credit risk on commercial counterparties will now be more in line with the current view on financial counterparty risk.</p>
<h4 id=""proactive-credit-risk-management-through-forward-looking-provisions"">Proactive credit risk management through forward looking provisions</h4>
<p>While credit risks can be a significant threat to business continuity, provisions for credit losses have shown to often be ‘too little too late’. IFRS 9 imposes a much more proactive credit risk methodology, moving from an incurred loss to an expected loss approach with a three stage model, where the provision is equal to the expected loss over the next 12 months or over the lifetime of the instrument, depending on its credit quality.</p>
<p>Correctly calculating the expected loss is based on an accurate estimation of current and future probability of default (PD), exposure at default (EAD), loss given default (LGD) and discount factors. This will increase the importance of risk models and the need for a robust governance framework. In the end, provisions under IFRS 9 will make reserves more timely and sufficient which will have a positive impact on P&amp;L volatility.</p>
<h4 id=""a-more-principles-based-hedge-accounting"">A more principles-based hedge accounting</h4>
<p>Although the basic hedge accounting models under IFRS 9 do not change from those under IAS 39, IFRS 9 is more principle-based, with better alignment of the accounting impact to the underlying risk management activities and an increased qualification of hedging instruments and hedged items. Hedge effectiveness criteria are now more principle-based – abandoning the mandatory 80%-125% effectiveness range – and look, for instance, at the economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument.</p>
<p>Economic risk management objectives will be reflected better in hedge accounting under IFRS 9. It will also offer more flexibility on qualifying hedged items and hedging instruments, especially when there is an underlying economic relationship which may not have qualified for hedge accounting under IAS 39.</p>
<h4 id=""market-based-intercompany-financing"">Market based intercompany financing</h4>
<p>Upcoming tax regulations (such as the Base Erosion Profit Shifting project by the OECD or the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive by the European Commission) are aimed at reducing artificial profit shifting and require arms-length pricing for intercompany loans. If the loan is not made ‘at arm’s length’, it will have to be split in a below-market (or above-market) element and a residual loan element under IFRS 9. The below-market element will typically be recorded as an investment in the parent’s financial statements while being recorded as equity in the subsidiary’s financial statements. Under IFRS 9, this difference in accounting treatment can seriously impact the willingness of a corporate to issue intercompany loans which are not at arm’s length.</p>
<h4 id=""ifrs-9-opportunities"">IFRS 9 opportunities</h4>
<p>IFRS 9 brings fundamental changes to financial instruments accounting and has its challenges, but also offers clear benefits. For corporates that are already familiar with IAS 39, the new standards of IFRS 9 introduce some useful changes to better align corporate objectives with accounting impact and financial results. The role of the corporate treasurer under IFRS 9 may be larger than expected, due to the alignment of credit risk on commercial counterparties with current financial credit risk practices. While early adopters have experienced the migration to IFRS 9 as generally positive, the main appraisal for both IFRS 9 as the corporates implementing it will be in the months ahead, with the mandatory deadline right around the corner.</p>
<p>For accounting periods beginning on or after 1st January 2018, IFRS 9 will be replacing IAS 39 as the accounting standard for financial instruments. However there is more to the standard than hedge accounting; it impacts how financial instruments are classified and measured, how impairments are calculated and what disclosures need to be given.</p>

<h5 id=""robert-waddington-pwc"">Robert Waddington, Director Corporate Treasury and Commodity Group, PwC:</h5>
<p>For corporates, the new standard has been well received, with promises that some of the frustrations of hedging under IAS 39 have been addressed. However, what are these benefits and are corporates ready for the change?</p>
<p>The benefits:</p>
<h4 id=""alignment-of-accounting-and-risk-management"">Alignment of accounting and risk management</h4>
<p>The great news is that IFRS 9 provides an opportunity for alignment between accounting and your risk management. This was an annoyance of many when applying IAS 39 where what made sense from an economic point of view was not reflected in the accounting. This resulted in either P&amp;L volatility from derivatives not being hedge accounted for or even worse, transactions that made economic sense not being entered into.</p>
<p>With more hedging instruments now achieving hedge accounting, I see this as an opportunity for treasurers to reassess how they manage risk.</p>
<h4 id=""reduction-in-p-and-l-volatility"">Reduction in P&amp;L volatility</h4>
<p>As noted above, instruments that did not achieve hedge accounting previously might do so under IFRS 9, thus reducing P&amp;L volatility. In addition most corporates have either used or thought about using options as a way to manage risk. Under IAS 39 the time value of an option was typically excluded from the hedging relationship and recorded in the P&amp;L; causing more unwanted P&amp;L volatility. Under IFRS 9, the movement in the time value of the option during its life can be deferred in reserves therefore, away from the P&amp;L.</p>
<h4 id=""hedge-effectiveness-has-got-easier"">Hedge effectiveness has got easier</h4>
<p>Under IAS 39, in order for a hedging relationships to be effective, the movement in the fair value of the hedging instrument divided by the fair value movement in the hedged item had to be between 80%-125%. Therefore, if the ratio was 80% then hedge accounting could be applied, however if the ratio was just 1% less at 79%, the hedge was deemed ineffective resulting in P&amp;L volatility.</p>
<p>Under IFRS 9 there is now no 80%-125% threshold. However, the standard does still require you to assess effectiveness however in a different way and any ineffectiveness does still need to be calculated and recorded.</p>
<p>Are corporates ready for the change? At our recent IFRS 9 event, 53% of people had either:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Not yet started looking at IFRS 9.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only read the standard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are just about to set up a project team.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With the clock ticking it is vital that corporates focus on it now.</p>
<p>As IFRS 9 looms closer, many treasury teams are looking to embrace a number of advantages that will simplify hedge accounting compliance.</p>
<img alt=""Bob Stark"" height=""150"" src=""https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/regulation-and-standards/accounting/2017-07and08-tt-11-qa__bob-stark-100x150.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=132DDA4333D1198ACD733F8847300B23"" width=""100""/> 
<h5 id=""bob-stark-kyriba"">Bob Stark, VP Strategy, Kyriba:</h5>
<p>Under IAS 39, one of the main issues was that the pursuit of hedge accounting treatment sometimes conflicted with the reason treasury teams were hedging in the first place. Achieving a perfect ‘accounting hedge’ was not necessarily in sync with the ideal ‘economic hedge’. Thus, a key objective of IFRS 9 was to better align the accounting treatment of a hedge with the treasury team’s risk strategy.</p>
<p>One of the most obvious differences between IAS 39 and IFRS 9 is the lack of prospective effectiveness testing and the removal of the 80/125 rule for retrospective testing. It was felt that these particular elements of effectiveness testing could be susceptible to outside factors that falsely suggested the hedge was ineffective. Unfortunately, this could affect whether hedge accounting could continue or could even be pursued in the first place. Under IFRS 9, ineffectiveness amounts will continue to be booked to income accounts but a low effectiveness testing result will not require de-designation of the hedge.</p>
<p>While most corporates utilise forward contracts for hedging, some may reconsider the use of options, as the time value of options receives better treatment under IFRS 9. Under IAS 39, the time value of an option was excluded from effectiveness tests and journalised directly to P&amp;L. This created volatility in the income statement, which is ironically what treasurers were looking to avoid in their initial pursuit of hedge accounting treatment. As a result, many avoided using options in their hedging programmes.</p>
<p>Fortunately, IFRS allows deferral of the option’s time value to the balance sheet for a temporary period. Like the effective portions of the option’s intrinsic value, the time value will ultimately be reclassified back to income accounts. But it is this initial deferral which solves a big concern for those that had previously used options to hedge prior to hedge accounting being first introduced.</p>
<p>Enterprises that hedge commodity risk also have much to gain under IFRS 9. One of the biggest critiques of IAS 39 was that the entire underlying commodity transaction had to be hedged. IFRS 9 takes a different approach, where individual risk components can be isolated for hedge accounting. This will mostly help organisations that have multiple risks within business contracts – and it will encourage them to hedge more because they will no longer be punished for having multiple risks within their business contracts.</p>
<p>With any regulatory update, there are bound to be some negatives. For most, perhaps the biggest surprise within IFRS 9 may be that hedges cannot be de-designated unless the risk management objective itself changes. Under prior legislation, treasury teams could stop their pursuit of hedge accounting and end the hedge if results didn’t go their way or they wanted to try something better. That flexibility no longer exists, which puts more importance upon the setting of risk management objectives when designating the hedge in the first place.</p>
<p>Overall, IFRS 9 seems to have achieved its objective to solve the most popular concerns of treasury teams. The hope is that with IFRS 9 more organisations will be compelled to hedge more of their FX, interest rate and commodity risks, thus better protecting financial assets and business value of their organisations.</p>

Crunch time,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Corporates today are experiencing a degree of ‘uncertainty fatigue’, as they have waited for more than a decade for the convergence of the two main accounting standards – the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP).</p>
<p>The corporate number crunchers want the rules to be laid out so that they can take the necessary measures to become compliant.</p>
<p>“I think the corporate community just wants clarity. They have been waiting for a long time and now want a standardised accounting model so they can start adjusting their systems and get on with it,” says Mark Vaessen, Global IFRS Leader at KPMG.</p>
<p>Since the signing of the Norwalk Agreement in 2002, the US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) have been working towards converging the standards. Most of the short-term and several of the longer term convergence projects have either been completed or are nearing completion.</p>
<p>A single international accounting standard, however, will not signal the end to this journey. Its implementation will be watched closely by many, and future reviews will no longer involve just the FASB and IASB but the rest of the world.</p>
<h3 id=""where-do-things-stand-now"">Where do things stand now?</h3>
<p>Convergence has been achieved for revenue recognition accounting and accounting for leases, but there have been “some challenges to developing completely converged solutions, especially for the impairment and insurance contracts project,” stated the IASB and FASB in their joint update in February.</p>
<p>The IASB is making limited amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, while the FASB is proposing completely new guidance, and as such, their exposure documents will differ.</p>
<p>The joint project to improve financial reporting on financial instruments is being conducted in three phases:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Hedge accounting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expected credit loss accounting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For financial instruments, both boards have eliminated differences in their respective classification and measurement models, and have converged standards on contractual cash flow characteristics assessment, business model assessment, fair value through other comprehensive income and fair value through profit or loss.</p>
<h3 id=""impairment-or-loan-loss-provisioning"">Impairment or loan-loss provisioning</h3>
<p>Overhauling the accounting for financial instruments has been the most important phase to date and aims to develop a more forward-looking provisioning model which recognises expected credit losses on a timelier basis. Currently, both standards use an incurred loss model to determine when impairment is recognised on financial instruments, which entails a loss event to take place before a provision can be made. This model was criticised following the financial crisis as it delayed recognition of losses and failed to reflect accurately credit losses that were expected to occur.</p>
<p>In a March statement, IASB Chairman Hans Hoogervorst said: “We believe the model leads to a more timely recognition of credit losses. At the same time, it avoids excessive front-loading of losses, which we think would not properly reflect economic reality.”</p>
<p>All entities that hold financial assets that are not accounted for at fair value through net income and are exposed to potential credit risk would be affected by the proposed changes covering loans, debt securities, trade, lease and reinsurance receivables, loan commitments and other receivables.</p>
<p>While the aim continues to be a converged standard, the extent of future convergence will depend, in part, on feedback. The boards spent time in developing a three-bucket impairment model, but after considering views by stakeholders, the FASB decided to modify its proposal to include only a one measure approach – the current estimate of contractual cash flows not expected to be collected on financial assets held at the reporting date. The IASB will maintain the ‘three-bucket’ approach but it will be revised to address concerns on which lifetime expected losses should be recognised.</p>
<p>Both proposed models remove any threshold for the recognition of expected credit losses and the information used to estimate and measure this is consistent for both models. The FASB has published a separate document for public comment on an alternative expected credit loss model. The comment deadline for IASB’s draft is 5<sup>th</sup> July and for FASB, 30<sup>th</sup> April, with deliberations expected to be completed in 2013.</p>
<h4 id=""hedge-accounting-1"">Hedge accounting</h4>
<p>The IASB’s move to improve hedge accounting by aligning it more closely with a company’s risk management activities is not a joint project with the FASB. The FASB, however, has sought comments from its stakeholders on IASB’s Hedge Accounting Exposure Draft but has not yet begun deliberations, in conjunction with feedback on its own proposals.</p>
<p>The IASB, on the other hand, has agreed to grant relief from the requirement to discontinue hedge accounting where a derivative is required by law or regulation to be novated to a central counterparty (CCP). An exposure draft has been prepared with a comment deadline of 2<sup>nd</sup> April (<a href=""#hedge-accounting-2"">see below</a>).</p>
<h4 id=""leases"">Leases</h4>
<p>Lease obligations are widely considered a significant source of off-balance sheet financing and the aim is to improve financial reporting by both lessors and lessees by recognising leases on the balance sheet.</p>
<p>For capital/finance leases, the IASB and FASB decided to provide specific transition relief for existing finance, capital, sales-type and direct financing leases. Both bodies will publish exposure drafts on lease accounting in the second quarter of 2013 and jointly redeliberate the proposals later this year. As with impairment, the timing of the issue of final requirements will depend on feedback.</p>
<h4 id=""revenue-recognition"">Revenue recognition</h4>
<p>The aim is to create identical standards on revenue recognition and to clarify the principles that can be applied consistently across various transactions, industries and capital markets.</p>
<p>Both Boards completed the substantive redeliberations of the recognition and measurement principles in December 2012 and plan to take another look at the remaining topics, which include the scope, disclosure, transition and effective date, in 1Q13 and issue final standards in mid-2013, according to the joint report.</p>
<h4 id=""insurance-contracts"">Insurance contracts</h4>
<p>Both Boards acknowledge the difficulties in reaching convergence for insurance contracts, blaming this on the different starting points – the IFRS currently does not include accounting requirements for insurance contracts, while the FASB is proposing amendments to its own longstanding insurance model.</p>
<p>They have reached different decisions on the model, including recognition of changes in estimate, inclusion of a risk margin in the measurement of liability and the treatment of acquisition costs.</p>
<p>The IASB decided to seek feedback on only five key issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Treatment of participating contracts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Premiums presentation and claims in the comprehensive income statement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treatment of unearned profit in an insurance contract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Presenting, in other comprehensive income, the effect of changes in the discount rate used to measure insurance contract liability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The approach to transition.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The IASB plans to publish this in the first half of 2013, whereas the FASB is targeting mid-2013.</p>
<h4 id=""investment-entities"">Investment entities</h4>
<p>Although the investment entity project was, in most part, jointly deliberated by the IASB and FASB, the final requirements will be similar but not identical. The IASB issued final requirements in October 2012 and the FASB will issue a final standard in the first half of 2013.</p>
<p>The FASB is addressing the accounting for investment entities more broadly than the IASB. Joint deliberations on the feedback will commence later this year.</p>
<p>Philippe Danjou, IASB Board Member, has tried to clarify some misconceptions on the convergence in Europe. He says the IFRS do not require – nor are there plans to require – all assets and liabilities to be stated at fair value, and notes a mixed model used under IAS 39, will be maintained under IFRS 9. Also, he says, for derivative financial instruments, there are hedge accounting provisions which neutralise any volatility when the use of derivative instruments is part of a hedging strategy and its effectiveness can be demonstrated.</p>
<h3 id=""will-the-us-embrace-ifrs"">Will the US embrace IFRS?</h3>
<p>KPMG’s Vaessen says the key question going forward will be whether there is enough political will in the US to adopt IFRS. “It has proved very difficult to make decisions with the two Boards trying to agree on everything.”</p>
<p>Despite this, IFRS is accepted in more than 100 countries and, as such, considered to be the global standard setter.</p>
<p>“Large international companies in the US are in favour of IFRS. They have reporting obligations in numerous countries and it is cheaper if they can do it as a group. They will have less reconciliation and bookkeeping to do. Whether you are a treasurer or an accountant, it is easier if just one standard is used.”</p>
<p>“Obviously US companies with a more domestic focus are reluctant to switch to IFRS. The transition would be costly, so they need to know what the benefits are.”</p>
<p>The global economic uncertainty has resulted in a focus on costs, especially in the US where there are other new regulations such as the Dodd-Frank Act. Therefore, this may not be the best time to ask for a big change in accounting rules.</p>
<p>Vaessen does not think a decision will be forthcoming soon. “The expectation now is the US will not decide until perhaps late this year or early next year, at the earliest.”</p>
<p>Gurpreet Banwait, Product Manager at derivatives and hedge accounting solutions company, Fincad, agrees that although there is some convergence, the official convergence is probably still many years away.</p>
<p>So what will happen if the US decides against adopting the IFRS? “It will be unfortunate. But we would still have one world with two standards,” Vaessen says. However, there is a risk that in the absence of a US decision on the adoption of IFRS, a decade of convergence may be followed by a new period of divergence.</p>
<p>On whether China, Japan and India will embrace IFRS fully, Vaessen believes this is very likely. “A US decision would certainly push other countries to decide. Even if the US decides not to proceed, I believe China, Japan and India will in the end choose IFRS.”</p>
<p>The three countries have already made significant moves towards IFRS but have yet to adopt the standards fully, with China and India adapting the IFRS to their own needs.</p>
<h3 id=""challenges-going-forward-application-of-the-standards"">Challenges going forward – application of the standards</h3>
<p>The next challenge going forward for the accounting community will be the consistent application of the IFRS globally.</p>
<p>“Despite it being in only one language, so to speak, there are a lot of different dialects. People are coming to the international standards and are sometimes pushing for their own interpretations.</p>
<p>The IASB set up the Standing Interpretations Committee in 2002 (renamed IFRS Interpretation Committee in 2010) to interpret and “provide timely guidance on financial reporting issues not specifically addressed in IAS and IFRS”. Vaessen questions whether the committee is geared to handle all these enquiries.</p>
<p>The committee recently changed its approach so as to handle more issues but it still needs to step up, especially on the already converged standards and even more so if the US were to come on board.</p>
<p>“There will however be a limit in terms of giving guidance. With principles-based standards, you have to leave room for professional judgement under the particular fact and circumstances, rather than try to give guidance for every conceivable fact pattern. The latter approach runs the risk of ending up with rules, rather than with principles, which would be undesirable. So, overall it is a matter of finding the right balance,” concludes Vaessen.</p>

<h3 id=""hedge-accounting-2"">Hedge accounting</h3>
<p>The IASB’s Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting’ proposes changes to IAS 39 and the proposed chapter in IFRS 9 to allow hedge accounting where hedging instruments are novated to a central counterparty (CCP) in line with laws or regulations introduced on over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives.</p>
<p>The European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) was passed in 2012 but technical standards on OTC derivatives, reporting to trade repositories and requirements for trade repositories and CCP took effect on 15<sup>th</sup> March 2013.</p>
<p>Hedge accounting in a treasury environment could lead to reduced volatility in profit or loss. However, the rules as they stand now are complex and time consuming, with onerous documentation requirements, says Amit Bhana, Manager, Capital Markets Division, Deloitte South Africa, where he heads the hedge accounting function for the IFRS Advisory Service Line.</p>
<p>The changes proposed in IFRS 9 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hedge accounting to be aligned to risk management activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removal of the requirement for a retrospective test, although a prospective test is still required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The threshold for hedge effectiveness testing being removed – replacing the current quantitative requirements and arbitrary bright lines for assessing hedge effectiveness with a qualitative assessment on the basis that ensuring the hedging relationship results in an unbiased hedge, with a second requirement that the hedging relationship achieves more than accidental offset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proof is required of a correlation between hedged item and hedging instrument.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hedge ratios could be rebalanced to improve hedge effectiveness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Risk components of non-financial items can now be hedged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relief is provided for hedging with options.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Treasuries should consider how this will impact their hedge accounting processes and their financial statements, says Bhana. “The application guidance remains complex in some areas, and significant cost and effort may be needed to analyse the requirements and determine how best to apply them. To complement a more principle-based approach, additional disclosures will be required of how a treasury is managing its risks.”</p>
<p>The changes are intended to align the presentation of these risk management strategies with the way that treasurers run their business. Designating hedging relationships without careful consideration of the entity’s documented risk management strategy may result in the entity not achieving hedge accounting. The changes aim to reflect all hedging-related activities in other comprehensive income.</p>
<p>“Ahead of IFRS 9, treasuries should review their current risk management and hedge accounting policies. It is expected that existing hedging relationships will continue to qualify under IFRS 9. However, the criteria to achieve hedge accounting will be significantly different compared to IAS 39, particularly with effectiveness testing. Potentially, hedge accounting can now be applied to relationships that were not possible under IAS 39,” says Bhana.</p>
<p>Finally, treasurers should assess their treasury management systems (TMS) and departmental readiness. Additional system and data requirements include the ability to track rebalancing of hedge relationships, measurement of risk components of non-financial hedged items and hedge effectiveness assessments with more statistical rigor.</p>
<p>Fincad’s Banwait warns if corporates apply all these new charges from EMIR and Dodd-Frank, then this may impact non-financial organisations using derivative contracts to reduce their risks.</p>

Working capital management: filling in the gaps,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Since the financial crisis, working capital management has moved up the list of priorities for CFOs and finance directors. With credit remaining expensive and scarce, treasurers are looking within the business for opportunities to release trapped cash. However, sometimes these opportunities are missed, particularly in the area of inventory. We consider some of the ways in which treasurers can maximise the effectiveness of their working capital management.</p>
<h3 id=""the-rise-of-working-capital-management"">The rise of working capital management</h3>
<p>Working capital management has long been practised as a means of raising finance. However, in recent times it has become ever more popular amongst cash-strapped companies, which have found access to credit restricted and bank financing costly in a post-crisis environment. Effective working capital management is not just for the cash-poor: it can also be used by companies in a better cash position in order to ensure the efficient flow of cash around the business.</p>
<p>The management of working capital involves optimising inventories, accounts receivable and accounts payable, as well as cash. By effectively managing cash flows and overall liquidity, the intention is for a company to reduce its overall working capital requirements. As a result, the company may be able to reduce its need for external funding or maximise yield on positive balances.</p>
<p>In a recent survey by REL, it was discovered that, among Europe’s top 1,000 public companies (excluding financial institutions), overall days working capital deteriorated by 6.3% from 2008 to 2009, from 44 days to 47 days. In a breakdown of the results:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Days sales outstanding (DSO) increased to 55 days – a 7.7% deterioration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Days inventory outstanding (DIO) increased to 39 days – a 5.0% deterioration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Days payables outstanding (DPO) increased to 47 days – a 6.8% improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The report also notes that while five of the top ten companies in the survey did improve their days working capital, they did so by an average of only 13%, while the remaining five companies’ days working capital deteriorated by a staggering 60% on average.</p>
<p>So, where are companies missing out? In this article we look at how companies should be making the most of the opportunities available in the area of working capital management, including the common pitfalls, such as ignoring inventory and neglecting working capital in times of prosperity.</p>
<h3 id=""working-capital-metrics"">Working capital metrics</h3>
<p>Working capital is defined as:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mtext>Working capital</mtext>
<mo>=</mo>
<mtext>current assets</mtext>
<mo>–</mo>
<mtext>current liabilities</mtext>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>It is usually measured with the following three metrics:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Days Sales Outstanding (DSO).</h5>
<p>This relates to the company’s accounts receivable and is defined as the average number of days taken by a company to collect payment from a completed sale. The lower the DSO, the faster payment is collected, and the sooner the cash can be used for other purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Days Payables Outstanding (DPO).</h5>
<p>This is based on the number of days taken by a company to pay its creditors. From a working capital perspective, this should ideally be as high as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO).</h5>
<p>This relates to the number of days taken to convert inventory into sales. A lower DIO means that inventory is being converted into sales more quickly, which in turn means that less inventory can be held and therefore that less working capital needs to be tied up in inventory.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A company’s cash conversion cycle (CCC) is defined as the number of days taken to convert cash invested in the manufacturing process back into cash after the manufactured goods are sold.</p>
<p>CCC is calculated as follows:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mtext>CCC</mtext>
<mo>=</mo>
<mtext>DIO</mtext>
<mo>+</mo>
<mtext>DSO</mtext>
<mo>–</mo>
<mtext>DPO</mtext>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>The shorter the CCC, the shorter the period during which capital is ‘locked up’. The CCC can be shortened by reducing DIO, reducing DSO or increasing DPO. In some cases it is possible for a company to have a negative CCC, meaning that it receives payment from customers for finished goods before suppliers are paid for the raw materials required to produce them.</p>
<p>Days Working Capital (DWC), meanwhile, measures the number of days a company takes to convert working capital into revenue. DWC is calculated as follows:</p>
<figure>
<math>
<mrow>
<mtext>DWC</mtext>
<mo>=</mo>
<mfrac>
<mfenced>
<mrow>
<mtext>DIO</mtext>
<mo>+</mo>
<mtext>DSO</mtext>
<mo>–</mo>
<mtext>DPO</mtext>

<mfenced>
<mrow>
<mtext>Total revenue</mtext>
<mo>/</mo>
<mn>365</mn>
</mrow>
</mfenced>
</mfrac>
</mrow>
</math>
</figure>
<p>The lower the figure, the more efficiently working capital is being turned into revenue.</p>
<h3 id=""not-just-for-the-cash-poor"">Not just for the cash poor</h3>
<p>As a means of reducing the company’s need for external financing, the importance of working capital management has significantly increased since the outbreak of the financial crisis. In a low interest rate environment, effective working capital management is crucial for cash rich companies as well as cash poor.</p>
<p>Roger Blackburn, Treasurer, Kellogg Europe, goes so far as to say, “Any business not currently focused on managing its cash resources and working capital will likely not be in business in five to ten years’ time.” He also points out that, just because a company is cash rich today, it may not necessarily remain so, as it will inevitably have to face increased competition from new entrants into its market sector.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Any business not currently focused on managing its cash resources and working capital will likely not be in business in five to ten years’ time.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Indeed, once predators perceive the opportunities being overlooked by current management, the company will likely be at risk of a leveraged buy-out.” Effective working capital management is arguably crucial to the survival of any company, regardless of its cash position.</p>
<p>Vanessa Manning, Head of Market Management, EMEA, RBS, agrees that working capital management is a top priority even for cash rich companies. In a recent survey conducted by RBS, in which 200 corporates were polled, of those companies that are cash rich:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>More than 55% are looking to take significant action to improve the investment return on cash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More than 50% want to reduce their bank financing costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Almost 60% intend to implement programmes that will result in significant DPO and DSO improvement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""ignoring-inventory"">Ignoring inventory?</h3>
<p>The key areas that can be tackled from a working capital management perspective are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Payables.</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Receivables.</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Inventory.</h5>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Treasurers’ working capital management efforts have traditionally focused on payables and receivables, which we discuss in more detail in our Best Practice Handbook, Managing the Financial Supply Chain, published this month. As Blackburn observes, however, “Ignoring the opportunities in inventory management is like operating with one hand tied behind your back.”</p>
<p>Inventory refers to physical assets, including raw materials, work in progress and finished goods still held at the company. Efficient inventory management depends on the accuracy of forecasts. If demand for a particular product can be forecast accurately, it will not be necessary to hold a significant surplus of inventory. However, as Blackburn points out, this can conflict with the instincts of warehouse staff who like to see their shelves filled to capacity.</p>
<p>In fact, inventory management is one of the areas where companies can most easily find efficiency savings, since it is largely tackled internally. However, it is important to appreciate the ways in which internal targets may materially impact external parties. John Mardle, Partner, Develin, cites an example of a CFO who called for a 10% decrease in inventory within three months: “The emphasis was purely on cost reduction of materials/services coming into the company.</p>
<p>No thought was given in most cases to the types of inventory, where the major inventory value was (ie in Puerto Rico or in Australia), or indeed what category it was (ie work in progress, finished goods, etc). The results were disastrous, with suppliers responding in various ways, such as reducing supply, increasing hauling and packaging costs, introducing minimum batch requirements and time-framed deliveries, all of which actually caused inventory costs to rise.”</p>
<h3 id=""whos-in-charge"">Who’s in charge?</h3>
<p>Inventory management can often lead to internal disagreement within a company, with the treasury and CFO wanting to hold as little as possible, procurement wanting to make the most of discounts available for bulk purchases, and sales wanting high levels of stock to ensure customers receive their products quickly. Therefore, an effective working capital management solution will benefit from the active involvement of all areas of the business – from purchasing (payables), to logistics (inventory), to sales (receivables).</p>
<p>“At Knorr-Bremse,” says Dr Sigurd Dahrendorf, Head of Corporate Treasury, “we have a process named SCE (Supply Chain Excellence) where all these participants work together in a permanent project under personal surveillance of the CEO and CFO.”</p>
<p>Demand chain management is one technique which can be applied in this area. This addresses all the key issues originating from the point of contact with the customer, through to order fulfilment and then to replenishment of stocks to satisfy expected demand.</p>
<p>Although the CFO or finance director may be in the driving seat, working capital management cannot be viewed as solely the job of the finance department. To encourage greater co-operation from other areas of the business, which might see the demands of working capital efficiency as contrary to their department’s preferred approach, it could be worth introducing a working capital target into the company’s overall bonus or variable pay structure. Any related product proposals or capital expenditure requests should also outline their implications for working capital.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“…top down is not enough, it needs to be from the bottom up to get local stakeholder buy-in.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another important way of ensuring that the working capital strategy is adhered to throughout the company is by introducing key performance indicators (KPIs) that relate to the main drivers behind the working capital initiatives as they are rolled out across the group. KPIs for working capital have traditionally been, and continue to be, based around DSO, DPO and DIO. CCC is also increasing in focus. KPIs have two key objectives. Firstly they provide a means for continuous improvement and ensure that both central treasury and local managers are aligned with the group’s strategy and targets. Secondly they can provide a means of benchmarking the company’s treasury team against its peers.</p>
<p>“This top down approach, in terms of the treasury or the CFO setting these KPIs, should always take into account the complete context of treasury – its processes, goals and interfaces,” observes Manning. “But top down is just not enough; it also needs to be from the bottom up to get local stakeholder buy-in.”</p>
<h3 id=""the-role-of-banks"">The role of banks</h3>
<p>Banks can support corporates looking to improve their working capital management in a variety of ways. Banks’ advisory services can provide insight into what other corporates are doing in the working capital space, which can provide a useful opportunity to benchmark against peers and discover possible means of improvement.</p>
<p>In terms of products, in the area of inventory there are products available which can allow treasurers to keep inventory off-balance sheet. In other words, the bank buys inventory on the company’s behalf by using a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and sells it on to the producing company on demand.</p>
<h5 id=""definition-special-purpose-vehicle"">Definition – Special purpose vehicle</h5>
<p>A special purpose vehicle (SPV) is an entity whose operations are limited to the acquisition and financing of specific assets. Their legal structure ensures that their obligations are safe even if the parent company goes bankrupt, which means they can be used to finance large projects without putting the company at risk.</p>

<p>Supply chain finance products have also been given particular attention in recent years. However, criticisms have been voiced that the banks’ services in this area are merely repackaged products, and that supply chain offerings such as reverse factoring are in reality just a means of increasing a bank’s security for its lending. “Banks did initially market new approaches to financing working capital,” recalls Mardle, “but then rapidly withdrew certain products as they found they were not sustainable either for themselves or for their own customers! The major reasons for this were the lack of understanding regarding levels of credit required, the quality of the credit and then the collateral required to support the package.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, supply chain finance products continue to grow in popularity as a means of enabling suppliers to receive early payment while allowing the corporate to extend its payment terms. A report by Demica, published in June 2010, found that 25% of 1,500 respondents had been taking part in a supply chain finance programme for several years and that 10% had joined such a programme in the last year.</p>
<h3 id=""technology"">Technology</h3>
<p>One area in which banks are currently investing is the technology to facilitate tighter control and visibility over working capital. Corporates can take advantage of this in order to achieve end-to-end visibility. Manning observes that technology is an important part of a bank’s offering in the working capital management space: “Innovative technology features very heavily in our approach to delivering what clients want – which is visibility, standardisation and efficiencies across their physical and financial value chains.” New technology allows for much greater automation, which in turn improves STP and can consequently bring down transaction costs. Demand for outsourcing various services is increasing and Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions can provide corporates with a much more cost effective solution for managing their working capital.</p>
<p>Treasurers should consider all the available options when addressing their working capital management strategy. It is therefore worth giving banks the opportunity to demonstrate how they can help, whether this is simply by means of their advisory services, or through specific products or technology offerings.</p>
<h3 id=""going-forward"">Going forward</h3>
<p>While the financial crisis has brought working capital management centre stage, this is not a new practice. According to Sigurd Dahrendorf, “Working capital management is always a very important issue, not only during crisis. At Knorr-Bremse we give this matter special top management attention since it is an immense source of cash generation, regardless of whether the company is cash rich or not.”</p>
<p>Now that the benefits have been more widely acknowledged, it is likely that working capital management will remain a hot topic for some time to come, even beyond recovery from the financial crisis. Treasurers are becoming increasingly focused on improving efficiency in all areas of cash management, and for companies that are weighed down by inefficient and time-consuming processes, now is the time to strip them away.</p>
