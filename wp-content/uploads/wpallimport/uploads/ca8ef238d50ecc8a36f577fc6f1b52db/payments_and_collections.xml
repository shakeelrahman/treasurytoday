<p>The area of instant payments is developing at a fast pace with adoption growing exponentially across all regions. Elena Gomez, Global Head of Domestic Payments, TTS at Citi, notes that over 60 countries are already live around the world. “It’s not just the creation of these high speed and 24/7 payment rails that is important, we’re also seeing a lot of innovation around value-add solutions that are arriving on top of these schemes,” she adds</p>
<p>While some of these innovations may have started in Asia, other regions are following suit: in Latin America, Brazil has recently introduced the new PIX instant payments solution, which has already started processing over one billion transactions a month. “This is a spectacular ramp-up, and is due to them pushing very good value-add solutions such as QR codes, with compelling use cases that allow the digitisation of many flows and the creation of true frictionless payment experiences”, says Gomez.</p>
<p>Turning to developments in EMEA, Declan Hourihan, EMEA Head of Domestic Payments at Citi says there is considerable variety in terms of the maturity of the instant payments landscape, but a clear pattern of growth in real time payment schemes. “The UK’s scheme has been in place for 14 years, but there are now multiple schemes across the region – and with SEPA, we have the ability to reach 36 markets.” He notes that around one in ten payments in the SEPA zone is now made using instant payments.</p>
<p>In the Middle East and Africa, Hourihan explains that instant payments are acting as a vehicle for financial inclusion. “Traditionally it has been a C2C play, but we are now seeing the adoption of B2C and C2B grow and we expect this to continue to grow exponentially,” he says. “We’ve gone live this year with Jordan and we continue to see new schemes emerge across our network including in Egypt, South Africa and in Morocco.”</p>
<p>As development continues – Pay.UK, for example, recently increased the transaction limit from £250,000 to £1m in the United Kingdom – Hourihan predicts that the use of instant payments will change from effectively being a B2C and C2B instrument to something that will become more interesting to treasury teams. “As larger amounts become possible, they can be used for sending supplier payments – obviously not those big treasury payments just yet, but this will really impact B2B and other types of flows as those limits go up,” he says.</p>
<h4 id="innovation-and-use-cases">Innovation and use cases</h4>
<p>As more schemes are introduced, and as existing schemes mature, new use cases are arising. Gomez notes that a lot of value-add features are increasingly being rolled out in many markets – and are even being included as part of the launch solution in markets where new schemes are being introduced.</p>
<p>In particular, she cites the importance of QR codes and Request to Pay or instant direct debit functionalities. “And also alias-based payments – this is where you can make payments using an email address or phone number, instead of having to use a bank account,” she adds. “These additional features are really enabling a new set of use cases, particularly for consumer-to-business and business-to-consumer payments.”</p>
<p>For example, Gomez says that QR codes and Request to Pay present an alternative to online or in-person card and cash payments. “In Asia, the QR code is becoming really prevalent,” she says. “Between QR codes and Request to Pay, there’s a very significant adoption now of instant payments in these use cases.” As an example, merchants are now adding Instant collections as an option during the online checkout process. Some other interesting use cases include digitising cash upon delivery of goods – for example, to pay for food on delivery or custom charges on a package on arrival to your door, ‘eliminating the use of cash in these instances is a powerful use case that brings significant value and convenience to corporates and consumers.’</p>
<p>In addition, she argues that many of these use cases are very transferrable to business-to-business payments. “Specifically, I would say that Request to Pay has the ability to solve existing challenges in B2B collections,” says Gomez. “It enables the collector to send a request to the payer, the payer retains control to approve/reject this request and upon approval an instant payment is made, meaning that the collector can receive that payment instantly. But it’s not just about the speed of that collection – it’s the fact that the message you send with a request, and the payment and the confirmation that you receive, all have the same reference end-to-end, which enables straight-through reconciliation with a direct link between the payment and the open receivable.”</p>
<p>This, says Gomez, is one of the key use cases which is transferable from C2B and C2C flows into business-to-business payments. Alias-based payments, meanwhile, solve a significant risk, which is the issue of ‘fat finger’ errors when collecting the information needed to make a payment. “It’s much easier for somebody to give their email address or phone number correctly, compared to a credit card number or full IBAN,” she points out.</p>
<h4 id="innovation-in-emea">Innovation in EMEA</h4>
<p>In EMEA, specifically, Hourihan says some of the most significant areas of innovation include the use of instant payment rails to facilitate digital collections. “The first generation of instant payments was really about making outgoing payments, but now the focus is turning to collections,” he says, noting that digital collections are being developed in the UK and Poland, as well as in the SEPA scheme.</p>
<p>Another key trend, says Hourihan, is the growing focus on how to leverage the benefits of instant payments in the cross-border space. “There is certainly regulatory interest in simplifying and streamlining the cross-border payments process,” he says.</p>
<p>As such, various industry initiatives are currently underway in this area. Of particular interest is a joint initiative to establish a cross-border channel, which is being developed by SWIFT, EBA Clearing and The Clearing House in the US, together with a number of banks. “At Citi, we use our global network to offer cross-border instant payments in six currency corridors,” adds Hourihan.</p>
<p>As Gomez points out, as innovation continues, the focus needs to be squarely on understanding the real-life problems that need to be solved. “A few years ago, it was difficult to imagine being able to make a cross-border payment in real-time,” she says. “And today that is a possibility.”</p>
<h4 id="impact-for-treasurers">Impact for treasurers</h4>
<p>So what does all this mean for treasurers? “From a treasury perspective, we’ve got to look at the future, where instant will be part of everything we do,” says Gomez. “At present, one of the highest demand is in a world where the consumer is part of the flow – so businesses that are heavily involved in consumer flows are likely to already be involved in supporting instant payments to some extent, while most digital natives are already leveraging instant payments to create best in class experiences for their clients.”</p>
<p>Increasingly, though, instant payments will become a feature of business-to-business payments – “and we are already seeing some indications of this in relation to payments to some smaller-sized businesses,” says Gomez. She notes that the benefits for treasurers are significant: as well as the prospect of 24/7 availability, instant payments come with a unique identifier which travels end-to-end with the payment, greatly expediting reconciliation.</p>
<p>“Another thing to remember is that all of these also provide real access to liquidity, compared to other methods of collection, such as credit cards,” Gomez adds. “This is a differentiator: as you are looking at outgoing payments, you only have to disperse your liquidity at the moment that the payment is being made. And where collections are concerned, you have real access to liquidity at the moment that that the transaction is received, which will become increasingly important as corporates adopt real time payments.” Instant Payments also offer the flexibility, as well as the ability to track important payments on an end-to-end basis.</p>
<h4 id="getting-the-most-out-of-instant-payments">Getting the most out of instant payments</h4>
<p>When it comes to taking advantage of instant payments, Gomez cites liquidity management and automation as two key areas that treasurers need to look at closely. Where liquidity is concerned, treasurers need to adapt to a world in which there are no cut-offs and 24/7 availability, which may have implications for how treasurers manage liquidity. “Now that there isn’t a real end of day, and they may need to have liquidity available for transactions to be processed outside traditional business hours, that’s a very important consideration,” she observes.</p>
<p>Likewise, companies need to have efficient processes if they are to maximise the value of instant payments. “For example, when we’re looking at payments on demand, the end-to-end process needs to be frictionless so that it can happen in real-time,” says Gomez. “This is very different from how batch payments are approached. And as payments become smaller and more frequent, any manual intervention will be difficult to sustain from an operational perspective and will interfere in the client experience.”</p>
<p>So where should companies start? Hourihan suggests starting with one use case in one market in the first instance, and focusing on realising the benefits available. “For example, we’ve got a large client that has decided to use instant payments to digitise their dividend framework – shareholders are receiving funds quicker, and it’s saved them a large overhead, while creating a positive buzz in the market.”</p>
<p>On another note, Hourihan says that companies should not overlook the importance of technical integration with the bank – but this doesn’t mean that the use of APIs is essential. “Some companies say they are not ready to do APIs, so they’re not ready for instant,” he comments. “If you have a very integrated instant use case, where you want somebody to touch an app and make a payment, API is certainly one way to go – but it’s not the only way to go.”</p>
<p>As Hourihan explains, using instant payments can still bring multiple benefits without using APIs, including data enrichment and the ability to receive funds quickly. “File based instant payments can deliver significant benefits and can be a good starting point for an established treasury looking to move into ‘real-time.’”</p></div>

<div style="width: 100%; height: 170px; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 10px; overflow:hidden;"><iframe frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless="" src="https://player.captivate.fm/episode/b4e66623-afb9-4150-ab14-7219281464bf" style="width: 100%; height: 170px;"></iframe></div>
<p>The last few months have seen an unprecedented shift as businesses, some willingly and some out of necessity, move from traditional bricks and mortar to e-commerce models, says Mahesh Kini, Managing Director, Head – Cash Management, Asia Pacific at BNP Paribas.</p>
<p>Based in Singapore, Kini believes that many Asian countries are a few steps ahead of the rest of the world in trying to integrate the impact of COVID-19 into businesses – the region being the first to face the pandemic – and that what he is seeing in the payments space here, marks the cutting edge of change. “The shift from shop-front business model to electronic e-commerce is one thing that we’ll probably see evolve and become the new normal everywhere,” he states.</p>
<p>In a bricks and mortar world, real-time payments aren’t often seen as a necessity. Indeed, cash reconciliations can be done once a week, or even once a month in some businesses. As a result, the supporting treasury management systems (TMSs) and enterprise resource plans (ERPs) are rarely configured to operate in a real-time environment. The changes forced by the pandemic are testing these ‘analogue’ set-ups to the limit.</p>
<p>There are of course payment systems available to facilitate e-commerce, and Central Banks in Asia have been promoting domestic real time payment systems like FAST and PayNow in Singapore, IMPS, UPI in India, NUCC in China, PromptPay in Thailand, or RPP in Malaysia. “Treasurers need support and advice from banks to manage their transition to these new payment systems,” Kini says. Indeed, there is a need to move towards real-time, or at least near real-time, daily reconciliations too. This, he explains, is because rapid dispatch of goods and services demanded by e-commerce users requires matching reconciliation speeds to avoid credit issues, enabling customers to keep buying.</p>
<h4 id="paper-risk">Paper risk</h4>
<p>Problems remain for cross-border payments though. “A lot of countries are still capital controlled,” explains Kini, noting that such payments often require a substantial number of supporting documents and paper flow. He believes that the digitisation of supporting documents will help revolutionise this space too.</p>
<p>In APAC specifically, BNP Paribas offers a digital workflow to help clients send physical documents in an electronic format. Clients are able to scan it to the bank, which is then able to process cross-border payments. “The client stores the physical documents in case the regulators need it in the future, and we keep them in digital format for our own regulatory and audit purposes,” explains Kini.</p>
<p>Arguably, in the current situation, the need for digitisation can be seen across the board. “Companies can go out of business very quickly if immediate changes around adopting e-commerce, new payment channels, and new ways of doing things, are not done,” he says. Decreasing the use of paper through digitisation is one of the main ways to do this. Paper should not be “lining the offices of the clients or the banks”, especially now. With millions of people forced to work from home, the dependency on and the need to exchange paper to complete a transaction is identifiable as a major risk.</p>
<h4 id="benefits-of-choice">Benefits of choice</h4>
<p>The necessary changes are far from a negative. A greater choice of payment solutions can lead to significant immediate benefits, particularly when it comes to cash flows and working capital management. BNP Paribas’ cash management platform is able to integrate with many payment services, such as the aforementioned FAST, IMPS, PromptPay, NUCC, RPP etc. , and in addition to receiving funds, it also helps client reconciliations. “We are able to give written permission that comes from the payment system onto ours, and the client can actually upload that directly into their ERP system to be able to do the reconciliation,” says Kini. Immediate access to that cash, when revenue streams are currently so volatile, can be a lifesaver.</p>
<p>When it comes to card payments, BNP Paribas has a global card acquiring proposition from Europe. The Covid-19 crisis showed that e-commerce is a vital new pillar for business continuity, in a socially distanced world. “If a customer wants to set up an e-commerce portal, we are able to give them a simple solution, with 350 means of payments, which allows them to accept transactions, manage data with dynamic reporting and fraud management.”</p>
<h4 id="building-the-future-now">Building the future, now</h4>
<p>The world is likely to be changed forever by COVID-19. When it comes to payments, the effect is, and will be, significant. The necessary adjustments that have been made now just to survive, will continue to provide buyers with a lot more options in the way they do business with the corporate world than they previously had.</p>
<p>Similarly, for sellers, Kini is seeing a lot of corporates necessarily moving very quickly into the e-commerce space. It’s a move that will have a long-lasting positive effect. In retail in particular, he sees contactless payments in rapid ascendance. “I’m not saying that other solutions will completely disappear – some of them will definitely remain in some shape or form – but I can tell now that change is here to stay in the electronic and contactless payment space.”</p>
<p>And whilst many may be thinking that blockchain will revolutionise everything, Kini knows that progress here will take a long time. Businesses will be thinking “the most important thing is to solve the immediate challenge”. They are right, and when it comes to payments, it is something that really can be achieved now. But it’s worth thinking too that the benefits of payments upgrades now will continue long after the threat of the pandemic has receded.</p></div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>The old notion that ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’ sometimes needs revisiting, just to see if things really are as good as they could be. One long-standing aspect of corporate treasury that has come under pressure on a number of fronts in recent times is that of cross-border payments.</p>
<p>The ability to make payments between domestic systems is still commonly facilitated through the correspondent banking network. This requires banks to set up accounts with selected counterparty banks (a nostro/vostro arrangement). It seems to be a simple ask.</p>
<p>Yet the correspondent banking world appears to be in a bit of a crisis, according to some high profile commentators. “The correspondent banking model is antiquated and inefficient, often resulting in high costs, payments not being delivered on time and illicit activity,” says the latest AFP Payments Guide, ‘The Advent of New Cross-Border Payments Systems’. Or how about this rather anxious extract from none other than BIS: “The continuing decline in the number of correspondent banking relationships in many countries around the world remains a source of concern.”</p>
<p>Whilst most treasurers will be interested more in the timeliness and cost of their payments than how the bank executes them, if correspondent banking is showing its age, it may be time to explore other options, and that may mean stepping beyond the banking realm.</p>
<h3 id="cut-backs">Cut-backs</h3>
<p>“It’s logical that banks have reduced their numbers of correspondent banks; they simply had too many when reciprocity was a bit too easy going,” comments Marcus Hughes, Director of Business Development at Bottomline. “Now the banks recognise the need to better understand every transaction, from a KYC and money-laundering perspective, many are de-risking their network of correspondents.”</p>
<p>It’s a logical step that has led to murmurings as to whether certain countries have been sidelined by the global banking community, simply because it is not prepared to be involved in those jurisdictions: BIS’s concern may be well-founded.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t call it industry retrenchment,” notes Karin Flinspach, European Regional Head of Transaction Banking at Standard Chartered. “But some banks have looked at the high-risk jurisdictions and asked if the business is worth all the due diligence.” Indeed, she believes that as banks with large correspondent networks re-assess the value of managing such large networks, some have chosen to focus on their core markets.</p>
<p>But Shahrokh Moinian, Head of Wholesale Payments – EMEA, J.P. Morgan (the world’s largest clearing bank, moving around US$6trn daily) believes that the issue has been transcended – and that the banks involved in these networks have been able to upgrade their controls and systems “to get to the next level needed by the regulators”. With large banks able to work with smaller players in countries far beyond the financial hubs, he argues that “this is not a major issue from a corporate perspective”.</p>
<p>By and large, most jurisdictions are still reachable via the correspondent banking network, Moinian describing today’s network as “a well-oiled engine that still allows banks to connect with each other”.</p>
<p>Flinspach, who similarly describes these networks as the “lubricant of international trade”, raises a valuable point in that tier one banks have an unwritten duty to help raise the standards of banking governance in the developing regions. Educational programmes can advise the smaller institutions as to how business needs to be conducted to maintain access to the international banking network, promoting models of due diligence, transparency and efficiency around payments. This, she suggests, is in the interests of all stakeholders.</p>
<h3 id="mega-trends">Mega-trends</h3>
<p>In the absence of a global clearing system, correspondent banking has, for many decades, been the only option. It is now a US$200bn business in itself. But that may be about to change, the rise of technology driving rapid progress in most areas of business. Hughes points to the success of relatively recent entrants to the payments arena, such as the niche cross-border FX platforms (such as Moneycorp, Western Union and the API-based Currencycloud), some of which meet a need by focusing on transacting exotic currencies.</p>
<p>Another new alternative channel Hughes cites is Visa’s B2B Connect. This is intended to help financial institutions process cross-border payments globally on behalf of corporate clients. It offers no direct corporate access – transactions by businesses being sent directly from their bank to the beneficiary bank – but it does take care of KYC, settlement and FX elements in one place. “It’s early days,” he comments, “but it has potential to be an interesting alternative.” Mastercard Track is a similar platform “with great ambition and potential”.</p>
<p>There are also now a number of blockchain-based currency initiatives which could resolve access issues. However, the volatility of cryptocurrencies, with the furore around Bitcoin, and now Facebook’s Libra currency, still raging, has served to increase the need for proper regulation in this space, especially around money laundering. Amongst much high-level criticism, former ECB president, Mario Draghi, has said that Bitcoin and crypto “are not designed in ways that make them suitable substitutes for money”. Crypto is unlikely to be on the treasurer’s agenda anytime soon.</p>
<p>Overall, some of the new alternative providers (the cross-border FX platforms in particular) “have taken market share from the banks,” admits Flinspach. Arguably though, the most significant change she sees is one of ‘attitude’, and this may stoke up the market more than any single innovation.</p>
<h3 id="from-b2c-to-b2b">From B2C to B2B</h3>
<p>The change is being driven by rapid progress in B2C payments, where the sharp uptick in e-commerce has seen consumers rapidly getting used to shopping and paying on their smartphones, and tracking delivery, in almost real-time. The slickness of operation, delivered in the main by fintech disruptors, has created great expectations, notes Moinian.</p>
<p>“Some of these consumers go to the office in the morning and become treasurers, and they are starting to anticipate the same experience from their cross-border payments,” he says. The expectation around digital is also pushing many firms – even those in traditional sectors such as FMCG and automotive – into adding direct sales, using online channels to reach end-users. This generates a subsequent need to offer the new (and often geographically disparate) customer base many more payments options.</p>
<p>There is another key trend to observe, says Moinian. With increasingly stringent rules around anti-money laundering, cybercrime, fraud, sanctions and embargos, although for the authorities “it’s about controlling the flow of movement”, ultimately it means that there are increased barriers to entry into the correspondent space for banks.</p>
<p>With intensified regulatory pressure, and with speed-to-market of the essence for those in the new ‘challenger bank’ space, some players will be looking seriously at by-passing correspondent relationships, perhaps instead connecting with FX cross-border payment providers. It’s all indicative of the changing face of the cross-border payments landscape – but does this mean the end for correspondent banking?</p>
<h3 id="work-together">Work together</h3>
<p>In the past few years, the industry has seen the international payments space evolve. SWIFT’s gpi has arrived, giving cross-border payments more speed and considerably more transparency, both in terms of the actual whereabouts of a given transaction, and the charges and deductions that each bank levies on it.</p>
<p>Every day, more than US$300bn in messages is being sent via gpi (with about 2,000 active corporates on board). Currently offering bank-only direct access, gpi is now being piloted at the corporate access level, aiming to give treasury more control over payments. With error investigations and case resolution functionality being tested, and more ideas in the pipeline, Hughes declares that it is “the best thing SWIFT has done in the last 20 years”.</p>
<p>Another welcome – and complementary – advance has been the introduction of the blockchain-based Interbank Information Network (IIN). This started as a J.P. Morgan platform for exchanging payments information with its clients; it has now been joined by more than 360 banks (Deutsche Bank being the most recent) with more than 65 now live since launching in 2018.</p>
<p>The associated information that goes onto the network is whatever the different parties decide to upload, says Moinian. In practice, it means, for example, that for a payment that raises a sanctions or fraud issue, where it used to take up to two weeks to resolve, it can now be fixed in minutes. With other banks free to develop their own solutions on the platform and roll them out to the wider industry, he believes it is on the way to becoming “a new standard in the correspondent sector”.</p>
<h3 id="collaboration-and-interoperability">Collaboration and interoperability</h3>
<p>With the higher cost of entry having seen some banks slow down on investment in this space, Moinian believes that the changing nature of correspondent banking has seen the spirit of collaboration extending “because banks now understand the need to encourage the network effect”.</p>
<p>Indeed, the more banks join and share data in projects such as IIN, the more the resolution of payments issues is expedited, and thus the more other banks will see the benefits and join. It’s something that Flinspach also observes, suggesting that “it’s now all about bringing together different partners – financial institutions, fintechs and corporates – to create and build new networks”. But alongside collaboration she says there must be the desire to offer interoperability.</p>
<p>Many fintechs started on the back of the B2C e-commerce explosion, and the sector is still driven by consumer demand for digital wallets and other means of making electronic transactions. But the fintechs need the banks to clear their transactions in the countries in which they operate. Between bank and fintech, it now shows every sign of being a symbiotic relationship, where once it was purely competitive. As Moinian also notes, for the whole piece to work optimally, “it’s increasingly important for us to have interoperability between the different payments rails”.</p>
<p>Currently, through SWIFT, traditional banking offers one rail for large B2B transactions. But as many corporates start selling directly to consumers, cross-border solutions for smaller payments will be needed. To make these viable, they need to be cheaper for the banks to run and for the end-user to use. Solutions such as J.P. Morgan’s cross-border ACH-style platform for corporates can enable, for example, a wire that starts in the US to find its way unhindered to an e-wallet in China.</p>
<h3 id="partnerships">Partnerships</h3>
<p>This is why, in the same way that there is bank-to-bank collaboration in this space, so the fintech community is forging partnerships with banks. Both parties are now fully cognisant of what each brings to the arrangement: teaming up enables customers to use the fintech front-end of their choice, but supported by solid banking payments rails.</p>
<p>The advent in the payments space of bank-issued APIs – where third parties (Payments Service Providers or PSPs) are able to access basic account information – is a good demonstration of the willingness to achieve this outcome.</p>
<p>Banks continue to spend a lot of money publishing APIs, especially in the EU where PSD2 has forced through the concept of open banking as a means of levelling the playing field. But without proper standardisation of APIs, there is still a way to go. It might be perceived an issue that although SWIFT presents as the formal bank-to-bank arrangement on connectivity, as yet there is no such formal agreement between the bank and fintech communities.</p>
<p>But serious attempts have been made by a number of bodies, including the Berlin Group (almost 40 banks, associations and PSPs from across the EU which is working on ‘NextGenPSD2’) to reach a standard. And Moinian comments that connectivity so far has not been an issue. “The fintechs are very agile developers, and the lack of a standard does not seem to be a problem for them.”</p>
<h3 id="asking-questions">Asking questions</h3>
<p>Notwithstanding the positive effects of change in the correspondent banking space, as BIS notes, some banks have reduced their global reach. “It’s as good a time as any for corporates to review their bank relationships, asking questions about reach, pricing, service and delivery times,” says Hughes. “With banks having de-globalised, it may mean corporates now need more relationships to get the reach they need.”</p>
<p>Obviously, treasurers should clarify the service offered by their existing panel of banks, and how this might fit with corporate strategy, mindful of current market volatilities. It is also important to gather information on the latest technologies before deciding which payments partners (and it may not be a bank) fit their future planning.</p>
<p>With collaboration and interoperability as guiding criteria, treasurers should seek reassurance from its providers that each is investing at the right level and in the right technology. Every bank’s API offering must be investigated too: although Hughes sees their development as “a bit chaotic”, the whole process lacking standardisation (SWIFT is talking about stepping in), APIs could be the means of opening up new payments front-ends that corporate customers wish to use. In this increasingly multi-channel world, where direct sales is on the rise, the more payments tools a corporate offers its customers, the greater the chance it has of retaining their business.</p>
<p>Of course, banks don’t have to work with fintechs if they believe they have the solutions that their clients want. But it is worthwhile for treasury to probe the bank’s development skills and agility because this is essential for a rapid response to a changing market.</p>
<p>At a purely practical level, bank membership of initiatives such as IIN and gpi matter because it shows the degree by which that institution is prepared to collaborate to expedite cross-border payments and solve issues for its corporate clients.</p>
<h3 id="new-world-order">New world order</h3>
<p>It may once have been true that treasurers were not overly bothered by the machinations of the correspondent banking network, as long as their payments were successful. However, in a changing world of increased risk and demanding customers, treasurers need a forward-looking approach.</p>
<p>“It’s not just the correspondent banking network that is changing; with all the political changes that we are seeing today, there may be certain banks that treasurers will no longer be able to work with, and others that they now can,” notes Flinspach. “Treasurers must set themselves up to be a lot more agile, and a lot more inquisitive about how banks operate and how political actions such as sanctions impact them.”</p>
<p>With similar pressures bearing down upon them, banks and fintechs are under no illusion that they must collaborate to ensure cross-border payments interoperability. Correspondent banking may now be just one rail amongst many in this new environment, but reports of its demise are, it seems, greatly exaggerated.</p></div>

<p>That’s the view held by Victor Penna, Head of Cash Management for Europe &amp; Americas, and Global Head of Structured Solutions Development, Cash at Standard Chartered.</p>
<p>The adoption of real-time payment systems across the globe is creating a world in which many consumers, merchants and even financial institutions expect to pay businesses at the drop of a hat.</p>
<p>The concept of paying now is not new. After all, paying by cash is an immediate payment transaction, but it is the growth of real-time payment options that is building a new standard, certainly among consumers. This new standard is now driving change for traditional corporate payments.</p>
<p>So how is the real-time payment landscape changing, and what effect is it having on corporate payments and collections?</p>
<h4 id="growth-and-impact">Growth and impact</h4>
<p>“Real-time payments were born out of concerns over competition in the banking industry, and their growth can be explained due to the need to get the cost down for consumers,” says Penna. “If you do that, then you’ll encourage more people to use banking services. This is particularly the case in emerging markets such as India or parts of Africa or Asia, where it isn’t unusual for up to 50% of people to be unbanked.”</p>
<p>The arrival of real-time payments can have a profound effect on corporate payments and collections. To take an example, if a corporate dealing with lots of consumers moves to a payment system that is closer to real-time, the company will be less reliant on consumers having credit cards.</p>
<p>“The dominant model of e-commerce for the past 20 years has been Amazon, which allows consumers to pay for goods using a credit card,” explains Penna. “But in emerging markets, the use of credit cards is not that popular as they are primarily an instrument for people with money, such as the middle class.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, real-time payments allow businesses to reach down to the market and capture a much broader base of consumers. “If you are dealing with a market where 30-40% of the population is unbanked, then the credit card model won’t work for you,” Penna says.</p>
<p>He adds that these markets are seeing the rise of alternative payment instruments – “things like mobile money and peer-to-peer payment types like AliPay or WeChat Pay. By tapping into these alternative payment methods, businesses are now able to do business with these consumers.”</p>
<h4 id="winners-and-losers">Winners and losers?</h4>
<p>In a real-time payments world, Penna believes the main winners will be consumers and small businesses, simply because they will be able to interact and buy services from organisations in a much more efficient way. However, he is also of the opinion that service providers could also potentially be winners, along with banks.</p>
<p>“Real-time payments are giving rise to a world of micropayments,” he explains. “So rather than everything being about a large corporate selling to another large corporate, it can really be about a large corporate reaching a much bigger consumer base by selling higher quantities in much smaller amounts.”</p>
<p>The past 10-20 years have seen the remodelling of business and the end-to-end markets, due to the whole wave of technological change flowing through different industries. The losers in this space, therefore, will be the ones that fail to remake the way that they do business with their consumers. “It will all be about making the purchase of services online a frictionless experience, specifically through mobile apps, because this will result in a complete remaking of a lot of industries,” says Penna.</p>
<h4 id="the-road-ahead-for-treasury">The road ahead for treasury</h4>
<p>For Penna, the road ahead for real-time payments and treasury is certainly an exciting one, with most countries set to have a real-time payment system in the next decade. He adds, “With more than 50 systems either currently in operation or under development, I think pretty much the whole of Asia will be operating on a real-time payment basis within the next 12-18 months.”</p>
<p>Should Penna’s prediction come to pass, the road ahead for treasury will be a difficult one – but he believes the challenges can be overcome through education. “Treasurers need to reach out,” he says. “They need to speak to some of their more innovative and forward-thinking banks, not to mention some of the fintechs that are directly operating in this space, to get an understanding of just what is going on in the market.”</p>
<p>So when will real-time payments become the industry standard? “I don’t think anybody has the definitive answer, but the most important thing for treasurers right now is to educate themselves on the options available,” says Penna. “Banks also need to play a role in this, as well as building solutions that are relevant for clients. As their industries and business models evolve, they will need a completely different set of services.”</p>
<p>Real-time payments are here to stay, so the message is clear: fail to adapt to the sunny uplands of the instant and digital future, and it could be your business that is left out in the cold.</p></div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading">The BNP Paribas toolkit making the most of international payments</h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>When it comes to processing cross-border payments, banks are continually developing new ways to help their clients fulfil their business payment objectives, fast and securely. BNP Paribas is ringing the changes with its digital Toolkit.</em></p>
<p>Treasurers have frequently faced challenges when making cross-border payments. However, with the advent of digitisation and interbank initiatives continually reshaping the payments ecosystem, businesses can begin leveraging ways of tackling these challenges. And not before time.</p>
<p>For Reuben Kane, FX+ Distribution, Global Markets at BNP Paribas, there are several issues at stake in the current cross border-payment environment.</p>
<p>“The first is being able to track and trace both incoming and outgoing non-STP payments, and being able to rapidly and easily identify and reconcile all payments,” he says. Secondly, in accounts receivables (AR), for example, he notes a challenge around pricing where there is little clarity along the payment chain on applicable FX margins.</p>
<p>Another persistent issue is in mitigating the ever present risk of fraud and cyber-attacks. Of course, there is also the necessary burden of compliance with KYC, AML and sanctions screening rules that particularly impact cross-border payments.</p>
<p>These issues are not insurmountable, says Kane, noting that from an operational perspective, their resolution lies in the almost universal treasury goal of achieving 100% straight through processing (STP). Naturally, this goal has its roots in technology.</p>
<p>“Treasurers are expected to deliver more with less in the current environment and I think digital technology is going to be a key driver and a key enabler of that,” he says. Indeed, he adds, BNP Paribas has positioned itself to help corporates leverage digital best practice, potentially saving clients time, money and resources.</p>
<h4 id="full-response">Full response</h4>
<p>Aurore Degive, Senior Product Manager, Payment &amp; Collection, Cash Management at BNP Paribas, echoes the benefits of digitising cross-border payments.</p>
<p>“It used to be that we would just send an email when we needed extra information to release a payment, and this could take time,” she says. In collaboration with its clients, BNP Paribas has developed an electronic platform called Inquiro. This, says Degive, enables the interactive, user-friendly management of inquiries and payment status, deploying customisable alerts and the client payments history to speed up resolutions, all without their intervention.</p>
<p>BNP Paribas is also heavily engaged in payments technology at an industry level. Degive notes how SWIFT’s gpi solution – with BNP Paribas as a founding development partner – is now delivering traceability to cross-border payments. But she explains how the bank is already starting to build on gpi’s value proposition. “Gpi is the industry standard, but we are developing a range of solutions for treasurers to help them track their payments and at will, both via e-banking and by integrating gpi directly with their ERP systems.”</p>
<p>Where FX pricing calculation and application has been an issue for treasurers, as part of BNP Paribas’ international payments solution set, Kane highlights the benefits of the bank’s currency conversion tool, FX+ Payments. This is designed to give “full control and transparency” over the FX payment cycle as it sits seamlessly within the corporate treasurer’s existing workflow, “guaranteeing competitive and transparent conditions”. BNP Paribas has designed FX+ Payments to complement the strategic FX management of clients, their workflow and their architecture, he explains.</p>
<p id="video">With solutions such as these being made readily available to treasurers, the processing of cross-border payments has seen many of the historical issues removed or mitigated. Of course, challenges and opportunities in the international payments space persist – it is the nature of a dynamic and, at times, volatile trading environment – but both Kane and Degive believe that BNP Paribas is positioned as a strong partner for its corporate clients. And, they say, it is intent on sustaining its role as an innovating bank, working for the development of clients and the industry as a whole.</p></div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>The payments revolution is picking up a head of steam globally and nowhere is it advancing quite so rapidly and innovatively as across Asia.</em></p>
<p>Few aspects of the global economy have evolved as rapidly in recent years as payments, with growing consumer and corporate demand for faster transaction experiences driving proliferation of platforms across the space.</p>
<p>The meteoric rise of e-commerce accurately reflects the rise of the alternative payments and platform proliferation, with Worldpay’s 2018 snapshot of global payment methods reckoning the still relatively young industry’s volume will surpass US$4.6trn by 2022. According to Worldpay, alternatives to credit and debit cards now account for more than half of e-commerce transaction volume. A survey of 36 countries by the payments technology company, meanwhile, reveals there are at least 140 online payment methods in use today.</p>
<p>While cash remains the leading payment at the point of sale (POS), here too its long reign of supremacy is nearing its end. Worldpay’s study projects that cash will be supplanted by debit cards as the leading POS payment method in 2019, falling to fourth place in 2022, trailing debit cards, credit cards, and eWallets.</p>
<p>While the payments revolution is a truly global affair, at the regional level it is Asia that undoubtedly stands at the forefront of payment innovation, particularly in mobile commerce. Worldpay says the outlook for e-commerce across the region continues to be defined by “extraordinary” rates of growth, with five-year compound annual growth rates projected at 21.3% in Malaysia; 20.2% in Vietnam; and 18.6% in the Philippines and Indonesia. In China, the headline payments story remains the widespread adoption of digital wallets: “Led decisively by Alipay and WeChat Pay, app-based payments via mobile devices redefine the scope of the possible. Chinese consumers are categorically choosing the seamless integration and trusted environment offered by these all-inclusive apps.”</p>
<p>While wallet use is ubiquitous in China online, accounting for nearly two-thirds of e-commerce transactions, Worldpay also notes that eWallets are so popular among Chinese consumers that they also lead payments at the point of sale, representing more than a third of card-present market share.</p>
<p>Elsewhere across the region, Worldpay is forecasting growth and dramatic shifts in payments in India: “Home to the world’s second largest population that remains far from saturation in either internet access or mobile phone penetration, we project e-commerce growth in India at 21.2% CAGR for the next five years.”</p>
<p>Looking forward, Worldpay believes Asia offers seemingly “infinite promise for commerce and payments” though, with payment methods varying widely across the region, both between and within countries and across the spectrums of development from urban to rural, “companies operating in Asia face a complicated and demanding payment landscape”.</p>
<p>While local conditions across Asia may vary, Worldpay can readily discern some key regional trends: “At the point of sale, we project dramatic shifts from cash to eWallets over the next five years with debit and credit cards maintaining current share. On the e-commerce side, meanwhile, we project continued global leadership in the adoption of eWallets; led by China, we expect eWallets to account for two-thirds of regional payment volume by 2022.”</p>
<p>Worldpay’s assessment of Asia, the vitality of payment innovation across the region compared to other geographies, is echoed by Jonas Falk, Managing Director of ball-bearing manufacturer SKF’s Treasury Centre, Asia &amp; Pacific in Singapore. He says that in comparison to Europe and the Americas, Asia appears to be moving much faster in developing and adopting novel financial technology and solutions, with the rapid development of faster payment rails across the region one of the results. Indeed, Falk believes the pace at which payment rail technology and its application is evolving across the region means that getting the right regulatory frameworks in place to accommodate advances in the space has become “especially urgent”.</p>
<p>Looking further ahead, Falk believes it not unreasonable to hope that at some point in the future SKF itself might end up with just one bank account for functional currencies per country: “Today, if you look at the payments landscape we have a lot of different types of payments…domestic, international, clearing, different types of cross-border payments and so on. I hope payments in the future will be just like sending an SMS.”</p>
<p>He adds: “In many ways we are still having to deal with platforms, IT infrastructure that date back to the 70s. Over the next few years that is going to change, we will have more options. We are really beginning to see it happen now, we are seeing a lot of open source, open banking applications, APIs, customised peer to peer connectivity, with boundless financial functionality such as funding, discounting, payments and settlements and all integrated with existing processes.</p>
<p>“Over the last year or two we have seen an enormous trend in banks launching portals to attract communities; they are opening up now and deliver connectivity. It’s a very exciting time as it seems we are taking some important steps that will inform the future of banking and payments. We don’t have a global payments platform as yet but in the future that may be possible. That would create a lot of data so analysing it, exploiting it, will be very important and beneficial not just for treasury but for the organisation as a whole.”</p>
<h4 id="banking-on-real-time">Banking on real-time</h4>
<p>Among the banks, HSBC, which derives the bulk of its global profits from Asia, also believes the region is at the vanguard of the payments revolution. Thomas Halpin, Global Head of Payments Products, Global Liquidity and Cash Management, HSBC says: “Asia Pacific has some of the most advanced real-time payment schemes in the world. Countries across the region are not only accelerating their adoption of real-time payments but also using the latest mobile payments technology in their schemes. The key driver has been the need to serve a modern digital consumer who is always connected, values convenience, and expects a great experience across all of their devices, especially on mobile.”</p>
<p>Halpin explains that up until just a few years ago the traditional payments infrastructure in Asia was unable to meet digital consumer needs. As a result, internet platform providers – such as India’s Paytm and PhonePe; Indonesia’s Go-Jek; and China’s Alipay and WeChat – were able to use eWallets as an alternative, providing fast and convenient payments as part of a broader mobile enabled user experience.</p>
<h4>Chart 1: Asia Pacific payment methods</h4>

<p class="source">Source: Worldpay 2018 Global Payment Report</p>
<p>“Now, the rapid upgrade of payment rails across Asia Pacific is accelerating the trend towards mobile payments. For example, use of overlay solutions such as QR codes are key features of real-time payment schemes in the region to a far greater extent than they are in other schemes around the world.</p>
<p>“At the same time, financial inclusion is also fuelling the growth in real-time payments across the region, as governments see an opportunity to use new technology to provide financial services to citizens who previously did not have bank accounts.”</p>
<p>As payment rails proliferate and diversify across the region, so do the challenges and opportunities for banks and their clients. Nicholas Soo, Regional Head of Payments Products, Asia-Pacific, Global Liquidity and Cash Management, HSBC, is clear that for banks the development of real-time payments presents a tremendous opportunity to help clients transform their business: “We are talking to treasurers about how they can use real-time payments to streamline payments and collections, and how they can harness the new infrastructure alongside technologies such as APIs to gain a competitive edge.”</p>
<p>As an example of this in action, Soo points to how in India HSBC is helping a large microfinance institution to instantly verify applicant account details, via an API callout to the real-time payments network, prior to making the payment. The solution aims to ensure that there are no returns due to incorrect bank details and the applicant has access to funds almost as soon as the loan is approved.</p>
<p>Soo says that one of the big challenges for banks operating across the region is lining up the resources to go live with real-time payments in multiple countries simultaneously. “As well as new markets going live, many countries are upgrading existing infrastructure or adding new overlays. Often, we work to tight timelines for new real-time payment implementations and no two schemes are ever exactly the same. However, we are able to apply some lessons learned from one country to another.”</p>
<p>He strongly advises corporate treasurers to work with other teams across the business to understand the impact of real-time payments on internal practices and their client and vendor relationships: “For example, our corporate clients are working out how to treat inward credits from their customers over the weekend.</p>
<p>“Buyers are taking advantage of the 24/7 nature of real-time payments, which means they expect their credit lines to be updated in real-time on a Saturday or Sunday, to enable them to get deliveries on Monday. As a result, corporates are having to adapt their own ways of working.”</p>
<h4 id="critical-mass">Critical mass</h4>
<p>While the region continues to power ahead in developing real-time payments infrastructure and platforms, Soo says success ultimately depends on their widespread usage and achieving that is by no means straightforward: “You can only reach critical mass when regulators, banks, payment solution providers, and large corporates work together. This was particularly true in India – it’s Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) launched in 2013, but volumes grew exponentially over the past 24 months with the confluence of a large number of banks going live, greater consumer awareness, and business need for instant disbursements and refunds from large corporates, non-bank financial institutions and e-commerce players.”</p>
<p>Countries that have seen the biggest uptake in real-time payments are those where regulators have made it their mission to drive adoption, he says. Hong Kong, for example, is looking at different use cases to enable government departments make payments using the Faster Payments System, or to receive payments from the public settling government bills in the same manner. In addition, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and financial institutions are looking to promote wider adoption of mobile retail payments through a common QR code standard for merchants and consumers.</p>

<p>Soo adds: “The importance of financial inclusion in some countries provides a powerful reason for regulators to ensure market participants move to real-time payments. To take India again as an example, the launch of Aadhar (a unique 12-digit identity number for residents) enabled millions of Indians to open bank accounts, and it is expected that most of the payments will be through the real-time payment rails.”</p>
<p>For HSBC’s Halpin one of the most remarkable aspects of the transformation under way in payments across APAC is that even though it is a relatively new development for the region it already seems like business-as-usual, such is the speed with which infrastructure and novel are being adopted by banks and corporate across the region.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, he believes the development of real-time payments will accelerate the move to open banking, the internet of things and smart cities – all of which are predicated on the fast and secure exchange of large amounts of data, which is made possible by real-time networks.</p>
<p>“The next step will be for the real-time revolution to spread to cross-border payments. SWIFT gpi is already increasing the speed and convenience of international payments. But there remains a real opportunity to better connect different real-time schemes around the world. So, a traveller from Singapore could scan a QR code and pay for a purchase in Thailand within seconds.</p>
<p>“As with domestic schemes, success will require regulators, banks and corporates to collaborate, albeit on an even larger scale. But the prize will be even greater ease, speed and certainty for businesses and consumers making international payments across the region.”</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p><em>As the global transaction banking landscape continues to evolve, where are the opportunities, how should banks be positioning themselves for success – and how can they work effectively with fintechs to leverage new developments?</em></p>
<p>From the rise of APIs to the arrival of real-time payments around the world, a variety of catalysts and developments are continuing to drive the global transaction banking landscape forward. At the same time, innovative fintechs are developing new technologies and services which are placing pressure on banks either to compete effectively with these new initiatives, or to join forces with fintechs. How can banks position themselves for success in this rapidly evolving market?</p>
<h4 id="challenges-on-the-horizon">Challenges on the horizon</h4>
<p>A report published last year by McKinsey, Global payments 2018: A dynamic industry continues to break new ground, identified six main challenges facing the transaction banking industry in the short to medium term. These included:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Determining who will be the next competitor “in a fast-moving and crowded global digital business”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Harnessing the next digital innovation and “striking a balance between the scarcity of capital and development resources and proliferation of technologies and initiatives”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leveraging digital platforms “to meet clients’ expectations for a seamless end-to-end experience”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Digitising to improve operational efficiencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developing digital services to create new revenue streams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Managing change and attracting new talent.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The report warns that with the pace of digital disruption accelerating across the GTB value chain: “If they fail to pursue these disruptive technologies, banks could become laggards servicing less lucrative portions of the value chain as digital attackers address the friction points.” In order to avoid this fate, the report states that banks need to embrace digitised transaction banking.</p>
<h4 id="resistance-is-futile">Resistance is futile</h4>
<p>The importance of embracing digitisation in transaction banking is widely recognised – but for banks, achieving this may involve stepping outside the comfort zone.</p>
<p>“The question is, how much can banks embrace the enrichment of data round transactions using open APIs, and how much will they resist it?” says author and commentator Chris Skinner, whose roles include chairing the Financial Services Club. “Because at the moment I see a lot of resistance – I don’t see so much embracement.”</p>
<p>Skinner says that while a small number of banks “see digital as part of their DNA and are trying to transform their organisations from the ground upwards”, these are few and far between. He adds that most banks “still see digital as a project, and are resisting embracing what it can actually do for their organisations and their businesses”.</p>
<p>While Skinner says this applies to all banks, he sees transaction banking as the “low hanging fruit”, because nearly everything happening in the fintech world focuses on transactions as the starting point. “So if a bank is resisting enriching data in transactions by using open partnerships, then they are actually missing a trick.”</p>
<h4 id="from-overlay-services-to-falling-fees">From overlay services to falling fees</h4>
<p>There are certainly plenty of opportunities to embrace digitisation in the current landscape. Jerry Norton, Head of Strategy UK financial services at CGI, cites the rapidly maturing instant payments market, and the improving global interconnectivity between correspondent banks and payment providers, as the most interesting developments this year.</p>
<p>“Not only will this lead to further infrastructure provision and the refresh of commercial banking business and technology, but more importantly to new ‘overlay’ services for customers and participant banks alike,” he says, noting that this, in turn, will lead to better customer propositions and journeys while facilitating innovation and lower costs. “For example, SWIFT gpi will allow customers of banks to track their payments and credits internationally.”</p>
<p>But alongside the opportunities brought by innovation, banks will also have significant challenges to overcome. Norton notes that individual fees for payments are likely to reduce as a result of competition and regulation. “Banks should plan for direct payment revenues to fall to next to nothing,” he says. “Therefore banks will have to seek volume and/or use value added services to compensate for potential overall revenue reductions.” Consequently, transaction banks “will have to find new ways of charging, rewarding loyalty and developing new services”.</p>
<h4 id="embracing-innovation">Embracing innovation</h4>
<p>Key to this is embracing innovation and understanding how new developments can best be harnessed.</p>
<p>“A key balancing act to be faced is how to capitalise on the innovation whilst supporting the barrage of regulation being imposed, and how to carefully balance efficiency in the face of these rapid changes,” comments Hasan Khan, Head, Transactional Products &amp; Services for Standard Bank Group. He adds: “There is no denying that businesses underpinned by digital capabilities are better placed than those struggling with legacy infrastructure.”</p>
<p>Where transaction banking is concerned, there’s no shortage of technology innovation poised to transform services and processes, from AI and RPA to APIs and blockchain. But it’s also important to keep a clear focus on the real challenges faced by corporate treasurers, and the developments which have the potential to address these.</p>
<p>“Every year, we ask what clients are looking for in terms of innovation and what we could do better from a transaction banking standpoint,” says Hubert J.P. Jolly, Global head of Financing and Channels for GTS at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “And when we survey them about innovation, we don’t see terms like blockchain, API or cloud come up recurrently. If there’s one area that is always raised up as a major challenge for our clients, it’s know your customer (KYC) and on-boarding.”</p>
<h4 id="real-time-payment-networks">Real-time payment networks</h4>
<p>Among the most significant developments in the transaction banking world is the rise of real-time payment networks. The launch of the UK’s Faster Payments Service in 2008 has been followed by numerous other initiatives, such as Singapore’s FAST platform, Australia’s New Payments Platform (NPP) and Europe’s RT1 instant payment system. Other schemes are currently in the pipeline. Replacing older clearing systems, these services bring people and businesses the ability to send payments instantly – and while the focus of development so far has been on domestic initiatives, cross-border real-time payments initiatives could follow in the future.</p>
<p>Ad van der Poel, head of Product Management for GTS EMEA, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, explains that of particular interest for treasurers is the impact that real-time payments have on liquidity management. Historically, treasurers have had daily or weekly payment runs, which requires them to ensure there is enough liquidity in the relevant accounts at the time when the payment file goes out. “But if you talk about 24/7 real-time payments, in order to do a payment you need money in that account all the time,” says van der Poel. “So implementing real-time payments is not just about the payment part – it’s about how you manage liquidity as well.”</p>
<p>Van der Poel points out that in the B2C arena, real-time payments also have implications for customer expectations. “If a business accepts real-time payments from their clients, then their clients will expect that the service or goods they are paying for will be available in real-time as well,” he says. “So businesses also need to look into the broader service they offer their clients when they are thinking about real-time payments.”</p>
<p>As companies increasingly need holistic intraday liquidity management, fintech capabilities are beginning to appear in this space, says André Casterman, CMO at transaction data management technology provider INTIX and NED at Tradeteq, an investment platform for bank-originated trade assets. “The challenge for banks is to pull data from different back offices in order to have a continuous, consolidated liquidity view,” he notes. “That’s where fintechs can help as add-ons to internal systems for capturing the data and giving a consolidated view of the liquidity position.”</p>
<p>Alongside the many benefits of real-time payments, these systems also have implications where fraud is concerned. A white paper published in 2018 by data analytics company FICO notes that while new payments infrastructures bring efficiency and convenience to consumers and businesses, “those same payments infrastructures also offer those benefits to criminals”. The paper adds, “the speed at which money is now transferred via a real-time payments environment puts an immense amount of strain on legacy technology and manual anti-money laundering processes.”</p>
<p>Van der Poel says that while real-time payments mean payments are completed immediately, “that just means that you have to execute the controls you have in place very well. It’s more about educating our clients about how they prep their payments, which is key to all of this.”</p>
<h4 id="innovation-in-trade-finance">Innovation in trade finance</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, trade finance is another area where innovation could bring major changes. Casterman says that fintechs have a role to play in digitising the trade distribution space. “Fintech platforms can act as a bridge enabling the exchange of assets from transaction banks to capital market investors,” he explains. “They can help banks originate trade flows – whether that’s loans, letters of credit, receivables or supply chain finance – and distribute them as quickly as possible to liquidity providers, such as pension funds and hedge funds.” He adds that these developments can help banks overcome the balance sheet challenges arising from Basel III.</p>
<p>Within the area of trade finance, Casterman cites the rise of new platforms and ecosystems within both the corporate-to-bank and bank-to-investor space which make it possible for multiple parties to engage in transactions. “Banks will increasingly join these platforms in order to operate their transactions with their counterparties, rather than having all the intelligence in their back office and just using the messaging platform to communicate,” he predicts. “So the bridges banks will be using are not just messaging bridges, but more workflow related platforms.”</p>
<p>Casterman also says that banks are facing new competition in the area of receivables financing. “Some banks might tell you it’s not competition because these platforms are financing clients that the banks don’t want to finance,” he says. “But one day, these platforms may be attractive to the corporates that the banks do want to finance, so the banks should certainly be watching these developments.”</p>
<h4 id="fintechs-competition-or-collaboration">Fintechs: competition or collaboration?</h4>
<p>Indeed, the spectre of competition from fintechs is a regular feature of discussions about the future of transaction banking. In recent years, banks have been assessing whether the arrival of innovative fintechs within the transaction banking space should be regarded as a threat or an opportunity. On the one hand, innovative startups, characterised by a level of agility which is difficult for banks to achieve, have been able to take advantage of technology to offer a variety of services in areas ranging from payments to investments. But fintechs also lack the scale and established customer base associated with transaction banks.</p>
<p>Standard Bank’s Khan notes that fintechs have the ability to target specific customer pain points and address them in an innovative way. “Consequently, collaboration has definitely become more important – as has knowing when to co-operate and when to compete.”</p>
<p>While the potential competitive threat presented by fintechs are certainly a concern for banks, CGI’s Norton argues that there are “bigger threats from within the industry itself”. He says that while fintechs have helped show transaction banks the potential of new services, and how this potential can be realised, “it is much more likely that the transaction banks will make those changes themselves, or team up with fintechs in order to do so. It is less likely that fintechs will be able to take business from transaction banks on their own.”</p>
<p>Bank of America Merill Lynch’s (BofAML’s) Jolly says that there are two different types of fintechs. “The first are public software enterprises that our clients use to drive efficiency in their treasuries, such as ERP and treasury workstation providers,” he says. “The second are the smaller fintechs that are looking to potentially disrupt the transaction banking space.”</p>
<p>Where the first type of fintech is concerned, Jolly emphasises the need for banks to engage with vendors to understand how their offerings could impact clients’ treasury functions. “The second bucket is more of an opportunity than a competitive threat,” he continues, explaining that BofAML has the ability to on-board fintechs as vendors and market their products as part of BofAML’s offering.</p>
<p>“Our view is that it’s an opportunity – but you need to have a platform to be able to work with these fintechs quickly, embed them with your services and be able to market their services,” he says, noting that this approach is “best for the fintech, and best for our clients”.</p>
<p>Of course, not all banks willingly embrace collaboration with fintechs. Skinner says resistance can arise from concern about damage to customer base retention. “If you open up to partners, the feeling is that you are opening up to choice, and therefore the customer may switch or go away – rather than saying, ‘If we don’t give the customer the choice, they’re going to switch and go away anyway’.”</p>
<p>“Transaction banks have realised that there is no option but to leverage disruptive tech in solving real world problems,” says Vinod Madhavan, Head, Trade for Standard Bank Group. “And towards that, working with fintechs is a no-brainer.” But like Skinner, he differentiates between banks which have fully embraced this, and those which are still in ‘watch and wait’ mode. “Standard Bank Group is in the former category,” he adds, pointing out that fintechs have much to gain from partnerships, “as they get to leverage the existing infrastructure and existing client base that banks can get to the partnership.”</p>
<h4 id="poised-for-success">Poised for success</h4>
<p>Against this backdrop, how can transaction banks best position themselves for success? CGI’s Norton says that banks should “aggressively open up their processes, data and systems to allow third-party access, whether directly by customers or via third parties”. At the same time, he says that banks need to “court suitable fintechs and introduce flexible new services to help corporate customers in their own digital journeys”.</p>
<p>This means adapting to the changing needs and expectations of corporate clients. Jolly explains that CashPro®, BofAML’s digital portal, has shifted over time as clients have increasingly embraced technology and digitisation. “It’s the idea over time that this will become a digital assistant,” he says. “We’ve already installed live chat, and one of the big enhancements we launched last year was giving clients the ability to use CashPro® Assistant to refresh their KYC and exchange documents securely.”</p>
<p>Last but not least, Standard Bank’s Madhavan emphasises that transaction banks need to focus on delivering value to clients – for example, by focusing on solving real-world problems – and on helping clients to grow, manage risk and tap into operational efficiency. “While doing so, it’s critical that transaction banks focus on doing the ‘right business the right way’,” he concludes. “Leveraging the disruptive tech, and collaborating with fintechs, positions transactions banks well towards doing the same.”</p></div>

<p style="clear:both;">In parallel corporate treasurers are using digital disruption to quicken their shift to strategic treasury. Robotic process automation is minimising time spent on routine and repetitive operational tasks. Artificial intelligence, machine learning and analytics are helping treasurers to gain insights that enhance their role as internal business consultants. To contribute to enterprise-wide top-line growth, corporate treasurers seek new tools to support business transformation.</p>
<p>Virtual accounts are one such tool, providing the functionality to set up business wallets: an increasingly prevalent driver behind disruptive business models. Virtual business wallets serve as the foundation of many commercial applications, helping to create a digital ecosystem through which companies can improve operational efficiency and improve customer relationships. Corporate treasurers can bring business wallets as a fresh idea to internal business partners to support new business expansion.</p>
<h4 id="evolution-towards-virtual-accounts-treasury-focus">Evolution towards virtual accounts: treasury focus</h4>
<p>In support of the need to segregate cash flows for transaction visibility and efficiency, bank solutions have evolved. Initially “virtual IBANs” allowed businesses to reroute identified incoming payments to a specified physical account while facilitating better customer cash application. The emergence of receive-on-behalf-of (ROBO) and pay-on-behalf-of account structures (POBO) went further by enabling treasurers to rationalise physical accounts. However, on-behalf-of (OBO) structures added complexity by reducing transaction-level visibility, thereby creating the need to track and reconcile intercompany positions.</p>
<p>Virtual accounts combine one physical bank account with a virtual reporting structure that is uniquely configured to a company’s needs for segregating cash flows to solve for all three treasury needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Account structure rationalisation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved cash centralisation of both payables and receivables (via OBO).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhanced visibility with flexible virtual account reporting and reconciliation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The next application of virtual account management (VAM) is the shift from an internal bank account orientation to an external commercial focus.</p>
<h4 id="next-evolutionary-leap-for-virtual-accounts-business-focus">Next evolutionary leap for virtual accounts: business focus</h4>
<p>Virtual accounts can be a technology-enabled tool that can facilitate new business models for future expansion. They allow the segregated reporting of transaction activity by customer and supplier relationships. This extends the benefits of VAM beyond treasury for a range of business purposes.</p>
<h4>Forward looking opportunities:</h4>
<h5>Simplifying reconciliation for e-commerce platforms:</h5>
<p>Born digital companies, including e-marketplaces and gig economy platforms are expanding into new markets and undergoing explosive growth. Companies can automate reconciliation using millions of virtual business wallets to generate invoice-level data across different currencies and jurisdictions. This simplifies the reconciliation of incoming customer payments to expected receipts and the management of returns and rejects at a massive scale.</p>
<h5>Heightening connectivity in digital ecosystems:</h5>
<p>A supplier wallet lets sellers store and track value in a virtual account that remains on a company’s balance sheet. Technology and e-commerce companies can use supplier wallets to gain visibility into supplier relationships and heighten connectivity within a digital ecosystem.</p>
<p>Supplier wallets let merchants pay, receive and track multiple currencies in a single wallet without any FX. This supports a seamless buying and selling experience with customer stickiness. For example, a Chinese vendor sells via an e-commerce company’s US website and buys on the e-commerce company’s European website. A supplier wallet allows the vendor to use proceeds from US sales to make purchases in Europe, incentivising the merchant to buy more goods through the e-commerce company.</p>
<p>The supplier wallet becomes an integration point for understanding a total business relationship that was bifurcated into a seller in one jurisdiction and a buyer in another. Supplier wallets become a rich source for marketing insights, which track commercial activity through the lens of payments. Real-time data structured by currency, geography or business function easily integrates with other business intelligence.</p>
<h5>A supply chain and working capital tool:</h5>
<p>Treasurers can introduce virtual business wallets to internal business partners as a strategic tool for financial supply chain and working capital management. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>E-marketplace sellers can aggregate micropayments in their wallets to better time payment for optimal FX rates while extending days payables outstanding (DPO) for your company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hotels that accept advanced payment from customers online can use business wallets to pay their hotel owner-operators sooner.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="a-treasury-ecosystem-that-scales-with-the-business">A treasury ecosystem that scales with the business</h4>
<p>Virtual accounts can help companies to create an enterprise-wide treasury ecosystem that grows and shifts alongside the business. This network combines virtual accounts for treasury management and business wallets for commercial purposes to better interconnect business strategy and cash flow. It allows for a greater level of integration of the business relationships that drive cash flow, and, in so doing, supports scale efficiency, fast growth and new ways of operating that bring value to your business ecosystem.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>The world is moving to real-time payments whether treasurers like it or not and there are some benefits and some pitfalls. Being able to make immediate payments may help you manage cash and liquidity but most of the benefits are to other business processes.</p>
<p>In 2008, the main corporate use case in UK for Faster Payments was believed to be as a backstop if BACS, the domestic ACH system, failed. I argued that there were far more areas where business processes would change, including forecasting the growth of immediate loans and compensation.</p>
<p>Firstly, the cost of an immediate payment is significantly less than a corresponding RTGS payment and so may be attractive for some types of payment, especially with the UK leading the way by proposing to increase the payment limit to £10m from £250,000. Treasurers could reduce some bank costs by taking advantage of multiple, regional or national immediate schemes.</p>
<p>With immediate payments, reimbursement of expenses and payroll of weekly staff can be made as soon as approved, and supplier payments can be delayed until the date due. While this more dynamic operating practice is far more reactive, it can cause difficulties such as monitoring liquidity more closely, since many immediate payment schemes require pre-funding. Payment on delivery also becomes much more efficient, not only for the customer but also the supplier. Where immediate payments can support your business is limited only by your company’s imagination, and one business uses the references embedded in immediate payments to confirm ownership of the account and, thereby, identity.</p>
<p>Whether or not your business makes immediate payments, consumers will expect your business to receive them efficiently. They expect you to know immediately when they have been paid and to see that reflected on their statements, so efficient cash application procedures and systems are important. Many businesses still work on daily cycles but the always-on, connected nature of commerce does not lend itself to end of day statements and reconciliation. For this reason, open banking or access to accounts via APIs will go hand-in-hand with the new instant payment schemes to bring the instant corporation to life.</p>
<p>Should treasurers be concerned about faster payments? Since immediate payments are generally irrevocable this means you and the A/P team should be on the lookout for errors and fraud, such as CEO or invoice scams where criminals persuade you to make payments to accounts in their control. This has also led to real-time, money-mule networks whereby proceeds of crime, once obtained, are difficult to track and recover. This in itself may be a key reason for a treasurer to think about faster payments.</p>
<p>In short, whether or not we want to make them, real-time payments challenge our businesses to become more real-time immediate themselves and treasury, with its view over the banking relationships, is at the heart of the business transformation.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>I believe that real-time payments are not too much of interest to treasurers, or at least not in general.</p>
<p>They may give an advantage to ‘cash out’ when it comes to retail outlets though. If, for example, a company works with small outlets, and from which it must get ‘cash on delivery’, then there will definitely be an upside to real-time. If, on the other hand, we are talking about B2B operations that are linked to medium and large companies, then immediate payments, in my opinion, will not give any real added value.</p>
<p>In any case, many companies have processes of internal authorisation that can cancel out the advantages of paying immediately. But, above all, most are now using systems that easily allow the execution of payments, regardless of whether they are immediate or not. If we are talking about payments made intra-day, then without a doubt they can be useful. But, for me, the idea of ‘instant payment’ is not yet something I consider to be particularly useful for most businesses.</p>
<p>That said, although real-time payments have a certain utility, and perhaps even an important advantage, if used by companies to cash out from small and disparate outlets, I believe that real-time payments could create new problems around cyber fraud. As such, surely treasurers will have to change the way they work if they want to use these systems?</p>
<p>Indeed, treasury policies are part of the future of the financial management of companies. Each and every change to policy must therefore be taken into consideration. For companies that do decide to use the real-time method of payment, there will necessarily be a lot of policy changes to implement. Those who choose not to adopt this model will obviously not have to completely rewrite policy, but may have to take it into consideration when using this new method for one-off or particular payments – even though I suspect this would only be on very rare occasions.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>“Real-time” or “instant” payments (RTPS), unlike other traditional payment methods, guarantee immediate availability of funds to the beneficiary of the transaction. Treasurers need to assess the impact of this form of payment on their treasury function and utilise RTPS, where beneficial, while ensuring that they address the accompanying challenges.</p>
<p>Firstly, from the strategic perspective, RTPS can have a significant impact on treasury risks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Organisations can receive incoming flows in real time, enabling them to have their funds sooner, plan outgoing payments based on incoming flows more accurately and hence reduce the liquidity management buffer required to ensure the adequacy of funds for day-to-day obligations. This could result in finance cost savings as well as reduced counterparty and refinancing risks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instant receipts and payments can facilitate more accurate cash flow forecasting, better cash visibility across countries and faster cash concentration through real-time intra-day sweeps. This enables organisations to put idle cash to use faster, reducing cash management risk and finance costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RTPS in foreign currency enable the use of spot FX deals rather than risking a rate change in a few days’ time when payments would otherwise be made, reducing the FX rate uncertainty.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>RTPS can also have an operational impact on treasury functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The concept of cut off times and the need to build clearing time into payment schedules is no longer necessary. This also reduces the need for extensive reconciliation processes (eg payment “instruction to execution” reconciliations) and provides the opportunity for greater standardisation and automation, allowing treasurers to streamline processes, improve control and save costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if RTPS are not widely used within an organisation, they can still act as a last resort solution to facilitate overlooked last-minute payments, in order to avoid missed payments that can lead to penalties and reputational loss.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, treasurers should adequately address the challenges of RTPS in line with the risk appetite of their organisations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Given the instant nature of these transfers, RTPS can be an attractive target to fraudsters. Treasurers should ensure that the control environment is robust not only from external intruders but also from internal staff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treasurers should adequately mitigate the risk of giving an erroneous payment instruction, as there is little scope to reverse this prior to execution, compared to more traditional forms of payment such as BACS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The value of RTPS will be limited unless foreign exchange exposures are managed using real-time currency conversion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RTPS are yet another type of payment added to the long list of payment options open to a corporate that can further complicate the daily cash management activities. Treasury functions may thus require a regular review and amendment in processes and controls. This will help mitigate new risks and maintain efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Group companies that are net payers may experience an increase in their working capital needs and may require additional external financing and intra group funding or guarantees.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Nevertheless, real-time incoming payments can help improve the client experience as they may enable the faster delivery of products and services to customers, providing the treasurer with the opportunity to play a more commercial and strategic role in the organisation.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>“As treasurers, we have long suffered from inefficiencies when making cross-border payments,” says Javier Orejas, Head of Banking, EMEA &amp; Americas at the International Air Transport Association (IATA). “This is largely because those payments are dependent upon not just the debtor and creditor banks, but also different correspondent banks and possibly even different clearing systems. With no synchronisation, it can create errors and delays and, ultimately, more work for us.”</p>
<p>Until recently even the most efficient and digitally savvy bank could not guarantee the full end-to-end efficient and transparent cross-border payment experience their corporate customers demanded. This is because international payments are sent via the correspondent banking network and banks are dependent on one another for the timely processing of, and relay of information about, the payment.</p>
<p>A large-scale, global collaboration by the financial community to standardise processing and reporting of international payments was therefore required. Without this, corporates were left wanting: wanting a cross-border payment experience that gave them certainty as to the whereabouts and costs of the payment so they could efficiently send and receive funds, manage their cash and reconcile their invoices.</p>
<h3 id="time-for-a-change">Time for a change</h3>
<p>Built for the digital economy, SWIFT’s global payments innovation (gpi) emerged in 2017 to address the needs of corporates for fast, efficient and transparent cross-border payments. The initiative took a collaborative approach from day one. Banks, fintechs and the corporate treasury community worldwide, together with SWIFT, combined their expertise to determine how gpi should be developed to meet the service levels needed for cross-border payments in today’s business environment. Speed and efficiency were key, as well as consistency in the customer experience corporates can expect from their banks, transparency on the progress of a payment at any given moment, and ease of integration into existing back office systems.</p>
<p>“For us transparency to the overall transaction life cycle and defined SLAs within gpi are going to be the biggest benefits for GE,” says Peter Claus-Landi, Senior Director Treasury at General Electric. “We see this as an opportunity for us to improve our cash forecasting and optimise liquidity, because we will finally know how long it will take a payment to get from point A to point B. We also look forward to seeing data around the lifting of fees for these transactions, which will allow us to seek the most cost-effective routing solutions with our banks. I also believe that these insights could put pressure on banks to rethink their transaction-based pricing models.”</p>
<p>In the year and a half since its launch, SWIFT gpi has seen a rapid take up, with over 220 banks and other payment providers globally now signed up, including 49 of the top 50 banks on SWIFT. Today, gpi payments account for nearly 30% of the cross-border payments traffic on SWIFT, and this is set to keep rising as more and more banks join.</p>
<p>By using SWIFT gpi, banks are able to provide superior service levels to their corporate customers, enabling them to: pay for goods and services internationally in a fraction of the time it took previously; shorten their supply cycles and reduce their exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates; track their payments from end-to-end and in real time; improve their cash management; and receive a confirmation notice when the money reaches the recipient’s account.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>According to IATA’s Orejas, “What gpi does, through bank collaboration, is establish a set of strict business rules to make the process much smoother. As a treasurer, this translates into an enhanced payments service, with same day use of funds, transparency of fees, end-to-end payments tracking and the certainty of having remittance information transferred unaltered. This ultimately allows us to more efficiently manage our cash positions and improve our working capital management. What’s more, because gpi offers the potential to monitor the underlying data and charges behind every payment, we could even see a refresh of bank pricing and T&amp;Cs.”</p>
<h3 id="increasing-value-for-all-corporates">Increasing value for all corporates</h3>
<p>Lack of transparency poses a major challenge for treasury teams – particularly those managing an in-house bank or payments factory – situated at the centre of a company and its multiple entities. As the centre of expertise for payments in the company, and also when managing relationships with the company’s banks, treasury regularly faces questions and requests for updates on a payment’s progress.</p>
<p>“I think most corporates are at the mercy of the same issue – and that is a lack of cross-border payment visibility,” says Thibault Moncouet, Corporate Finance Operations, Airbus Intergrated Treasury. “Having tracking capabilities means knowing precisely where any payment is on the network at any given time. The time we spend trying to get more information about the state of payments, not least in dialogue with the banks, is recaptured.”</p>
<p>The most advanced banks today are already passing on the increased transparency directly to their corporate customers by making gpi payment tracking information directly available through their e-banking portals. As such this is a win-win for banks and their customers as it improves customer satisfaction and means that banks need to spend less time answering operational queries related to payments’ statuses and claims of non-receipt of funds, as the information is directly available to the corporate.</p>
<p>It is easy to see how quickly the value of gpi can spread. By just one bank making gpi tracking information available via their portal, thousands of corporate users instantly benefit.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-new-standard-for-multi-banked-corporates">Creating a new standard for multi-banked corporates</h3>
<p>For all the benefits that offering gpi tracking information directly to corporates via bank portals provides, this also poses a significant challenge for corporates having multiple banking relationships.</p>
<p>For a company with ten, or even 20 banking relationships, it is extremely time-consuming and resource intensive to have to go into each bank’s web portal or contact each bank for an update. What’s more, banks do not all provide the same details, for example about fees or routing, further complicating treasury’s task of reconciling payment amounts with the back office. And finally, even when information is available in the banks’ web portals, corporates still need to transfer it to their own treasury management systems to fully integrate gpi into their business processes.</p>
<p>To address these issues, in early 2018 SWIFT launched the gpi for corporates pilot programme to define and implement gpi standards for corporates working with multiple banks. The new standard aims to streamline the process for corporate treasurers by allowing them to initiate and track gpi payments to and from multiple banks in a single format and integrate gpi flows in ERP and treasury management systems.</p>
<p>“It is important for us that our banks offer a standardised solution, instead of us having to adapt our systems differently depending on the bank we are working with,” says Moncouet. “The gpi for corporates pilot is the perfect opportunity for us to collaborate with peers and banks to co-create a common solution that responds to our requirements. In addition, a common gpi experience across banks will allow us to benefit from additional insights regarding our payments. This includes track and trace capabilities, and information regarding cost and bank performance. SWIFT gpi enables better strategic decision-making and much improved straight-through processing.”</p>
<p>The service is tailored to meet the specific needs of multi-banked corporates. In addition to allowing them to initiate and track payments, corporates also receive confirmations once the payment reaches the final beneficiary bank. This makes the entire cash management and cross-border payment process much more efficient including, for example, when the final beneficiary claims that they have not received the funds. In such a case, if the instructing corporate has received a confirmation, they can respond directly to the end beneficiary that the funds have arrived at their bank and avoid potentially lengthy disputes.</p>
<p>The new gpi for corporates service harmonises practices across banks, including how fees are reported and bank routing information. It can also easily be integrated with corporates’ existing treasury management systems and connectivity channels, and allows messages to be exchanged in both SWIFT FIN and ISO 20022 format.</p></div>

<h5> </h5>
<h5>From your interactions with clients all over the world, what do you see as the main challenges companies are facing regarding payments management today?</h5>
<p>From our perspective, as both an integrated and cloud-based solution and service provider, we are seeing common issues around transparency, efficiency, fraud prevention and compliance. Companies are often lulled into thinking they have all these issues covered. But further specialist investigation frequently reveals this not to be the case. Consider fraud prevention. A business may believe that it has all the elements in place to secure it from attack, and yet most organisations have not centralised their payments processes. A business with 50 subsidiaries globally could have as many payments systems and bank connections, and many more people able to approve payments. Unless each and every one of these nodes are managed fully and effectively, former employees, for example, may still be able to access corporate systems as signatories. It may sound unlikely, but we know it happens.</p>
<p>Centralisation is not something that must be imposed upon all payments processes, but it should concern the underlying technology. If everyone works on the same central system, wherever they are, it means the same central mandatory handling rules can be imposed and managed. This facilitates controlling, for example, access and permissions around a whole range of payment elements such as amount, bank, customer and country. Centralisation of technology also effectively erects a fraud prevention barrier, giving a single view across all nodes. In the fraud prevention context, our system can even enhance that level of control through our ‘always on’ system-wide rules-based fraud monitoring, analysis and early-warning tools.</p>
<h5>If a lack of system centralisation is the root of the common issues, the problem is exacerbated by aspects such as customer expectation, industry regulation, and the unremitting need for treasurers to ‘do more with less’. Covering all that ground suggests a complex solution is required.</h5>
<p>That’s not the case. Central to most corporates is the desire to focus on their core business. In the payments space, I believe most companies, wherever possible, would choose not to get overly involved in matters such as format handling, connectivity, fraud and compliance checking. There is a relatively easy way to overcome this because those corporates can outsource these tasks to a payments managed services provider such as Serrala. They still control and run their business processes but the moment a payment is approved, it can be forwarded to us to run those onerous back office functions such as format conversion, mapping and routing, routing optimisation and the connectivity to the most appropriate banking channel. Of course, as we respond to our customers’ growing requirements, so we can deploy our expanding knowledge and solution set to help many others enjoy the same benefits.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning here that access to this broad and deep industry experience cannot be achieved by a business working in isolation. And this is a potentially complex scenario to manage. An international business dealing with just five network banks across 100 countries will have to develop and execute for every bank in every country, a country-specific payment dialect. In this case, 500 different formats are required. Using the right technology approach and a trusted vendor allows the treasurer to focus on what needs to be paid, how and when. With our payments routing optimisation algorithms, factors such as bank fees and even agreed wallet-share can be handled automatically. Now consider how a large company manages this alone. It’s a huge workload for that business, even across a relatively small network.</p>
<h5>You have a large client-base; in what state do you find many companies when trying to tackle these issues?</h5>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, only a very small number of corporations are fully centralised from a payments perspective. But a business can be centralised and still be at the mercy of multiple technology solutions. Even more commonly, we see systems fragmented along country- or region-specific lines.</p>
<p>Typically, we see organisations asking their banks to help them bring order to their processes, instructing them to take on the mapping and connectivity to other institutions. From what I see, the banks are usually not equipped to be able to execute these requirements automatically. Ultimately, the customer has to manage their own payments processes and find the right solution to handle their instructions in the necessary transparent, efficient and secure manner.</p>
<h5>Paint a picture of how centralisation positively affects treasurers in areas such as order-to-cash, procure-to-pay, payments, cash visibility and data and document management.</h5>
<p>When seen from an order-to-cash standpoint, centralisation means considerable process time savings, working capital optimisation, process security and strong compliance. And for global organisations, it can mean fewer automatic write-offs of outstanding debt; this can represent a huge amount of money saved.</p>
<p>Perhaps for historical reasons, many corporates run their payments separately from invoice processing. On the procure-to-pay side, an invoice generated by the supplier will be checked, matched, posted and eventually paid. Where technology centralisation has been implemented effectively, the functions can be seamless. A business can start with an open invoice, and end with a payment in the supplier’s account, with no need for human intervention. In our system, this can account for more than 85% of cases.</p>
<p>The reduction in exceptions alone means time- and cost-savings can be significant here too. But with a straight through automated process, so long as the master data from the supplier has not been changed in any way, there can be certainty that fraud has not been attempted. Seamless automation can also ensure all invoice discounts from suppliers are accredited. In a manual set-up, often these are missed, again potentially costing the company time and money to correct, if they are even acknowledged. It should be noted too that where seamless automation generates more accurate days payable outstanding (DPO) figures, working capital optimisation can increase accordingly.</p>
<p>In my view, centralised payment processing means it is possible for a business to collect and manage data at a single node, for everything from a single manual treasury payment to instructions from global payments factories and bulk payments on-behalf-of. By combining managed payments services with clear authorisation pathways, the organisation is able to assume control of the payment and all its related historical data.</p>
<p>Of course, the standard internal business processes used to create payments files will vary from function to function, the different needs of Accounts Payable and Treasury, for example, placing different requirements on the system. However, with the rise of real-time payments systems, these different business processes must be able to align in order to handle the data flow to banks in all the available channels. This will be the case whether accessing in the ‘classic’ mode direct to bank, or through modes such as credit and virtual card payments and even blockchain payments (the latter we see currently rising up the agenda). In effect, companies that wish to have the luxury of choosing between real-time and bulk payments will have to be able to align their entire payments stream.</p>
<p>For every business, everything starts and ends with a payment one way or another. It demands full visibility if the start and end points are not to be left to chance. All the information from order-to-cash and procure-to-pay must be automatically integrated and available in the treasury system, alongside treasury’s own transactional data.</p>
<p>Linking current with historical payments information falls to effective data and document management. A centralised payments data and document view, drawn from both short- and long-term files, enables the treasurer to immediately access everything needed to deep-dive into a specific transaction – such as an underlying invoice or requisition – prior to authorising or investigating a payment.</p>
<p>Given the volume of traffic in this space, from a data volume management perspective, I believe that it is important to be able to control and archive according to need. Not least of the reasons for having accessible data where it concerns European clients is GDPR compliance, in terms of both understanding the relevance of holding that data and in being able to easily delete it when requested to do so.</p>
<h5>What solutions are available that can help corporates achieve best payments practice?</h5>
<p>At Serrala, we cover a range of technologies. We are still very strong on our FS² SAP-integrated solutions, drawn from our vast experience as Hanse Orga. But we have grown and today we also have a new cloud suite we call Alevate. Each solution set can be run independently but we know that businesses are often more complex than that and so we are seeing a huge market interest in the combination of these two worlds; we call this our Hybrid Cloud offering.</p>
<p>The Hybrid model allows our customers to decide where and how to work. Accounting and payments teams, for example, may be SAP-focused, running on an installed platform, but treasury may favour the flexibility of cloud-based work. With connected data in the Hybrid environment, both sets of needs can be met, with each ‘view’ being available to the other, as required.</p>
<p>We can also provide a solution to the banking sector, helping their own corporate clients to benefit from our treasury and payments experience. Here, we are offering the entire cloud-based functionality for order-to-cash, procure-to-pay, treasury and cash visibility, payments, and data and document management under the name of BCrest. I talked earlier about the back office solution that banks increasingly seek to offer in support of customers. This solution helps them to address corporate client needs along the entire financial supply chain, streamlining and automating their processes. But BCrest enables banks to offer corporate clients more than treasury functionality; it is a source of data analytics.</p>
<h5>What advantages, other than solving immediate efficiency challenges, can or should the right integrated solution deliver to businesses?</h5>
<p>The main driver for most technology quests will be automation and efficiency. But today many requests are steered by fraud concerns, where authentication and access can create major issues for businesses. There is also a cost and resource savings imperative, not least from a working capital optimisation standpoint.</p>
<p>Often a project of this type is about preparing and strengthening an organisation for merger and acquisition or carve-out plans. The need for scalable solutions is therefore essential to allow data in- and outflows, to allow for the integration or divestment of entities with maximum speed and efficiency. The Serrala Hybrid approach is based on facilitating communication between the different parts of the business from day-one and, given the power of GDPR, ensuring post-carve out that all necessary data has left the seller’s system.</p>
<h5>What questions must a business ask of any potential vendor when seeking to automate some or all of these processes?</h5>
<p>There are some very fancy solutions on the market today but few of them are true end-to-end propositions. When seeking the most appropriate solution and vendor, it is important to take up references, asking how many customers and live implementations globally it has, and in which regions and countries. Question the technology and its ability to integrate in a dual installed and cloud environment, and, if the corporate requires managed services, to what extent are these available.</p>
<p>Obviously it is vital to prepare questions around software needs, from an IT and a functional viewpoint, but equally so to probe the vendor’s services, the relevance, breadth and depth of its knowledge of the markets, and how the corporate can be supported going forward because this should be a long-term relationship.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Corporate card programmes provide a level of convenience to companies and their employees by means of increased controls and compliance for their travel and entertainment spends. Through a myriad of card solutions available – virtual, travel and entertainment, purchasing and B2B – a programme can best be maximised by ensuring the optimal balance of form and function of card usage.</p>
<p>Let’s look at both viewpoints:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Cardholder:</h5>
<p>A corporate card provides the employee of a company with a payment tool to use for business-related expenses in the most convenient manner. Choosing a card issuer that provides a solution with high acceptance points ensures that employees are never out-of-pocket and by digitising spends on the card, transactions can be tracked against company policies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Company:</h5>
<p>An efficient corporate card programme enables the company to analyse and optimise its policies. By digitising transactions, companies are able to acquire enhanced visibility of its card programmes to ensure a higher level of adherence to its policies and also leverage the data for supplier negotiations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a few basic steps to get the most out of your corporate card programme:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Data:</h5>
<p>Start by getting a good view of your existing card programmes. If the programme is global, having a single global provider facilitates easy and consistent access to big data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Policy:</h5>
<p>Define a consistent policy across the organisation. An issuer with the right system controls can support your programme, resulting in better adherence to policies and provide data and audit tools to ensure stronger compliance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Processes and programme management:</h5>
<p>Embark on a journey with an issuer with strong digital capabilities to simplify programme management through online platforms. Many successful programmes leverage a shared service centre and thus access to digital tools becomes even more critical in overall management and execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Negotiate and partner:</h5>
<p>Leverage the data collected over time to maximise relationships and negotiate prices with strategic partners to drive economic value. Card programmes provide a great deal of data and issuers that form the right partnerships can augment that data further to implement cost-effective partnerships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Optimise:</h5>
<p>By benchmarking your programme with industry data, companies can further maximise their opportunities and drive financial and operational efficiencies of a corporate card programme. Companies can get more value out of a programme by implementing expense management systems to further enhance the data capture of a cards programme.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The value of a corporate card programme can be further enhanced by extending the programme beyond the travel expenses to include other supplier payments, typically non-strategic and indirect. A procurement card programme is a great complement to the corporate card and in the digital age, the procurement card has gone virtual with enhanced capabilities and controls. An example is Citi’s Virtual Card Accounts (VCA) for corporate clients; we are the only bank to launch this across 11 markets in the Asia Pacific region.</p>
<p>A powerful electronic global payment solution that offers unparalleled control and flexibility without the need to issue plastic cards, VCA allows clients to generate unique 16-digit virtual card numbers with transaction-level controls, enabling additional security and improved reconciliation to a client’s purchasing process.</p>
<p>It provides enhanced card transaction data that enables streamlined programme reporting, improved audit capabilities and automated back-end reconciliation processes. Collectively, VCA’s flexible, real-time capabilities empower organisations to improve transaction management and reduce risk, while driving greater spend to their existing commercial card programme.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>As the global economy continues to grow, cross-border economic flows and business travel are also forecast to rise sharply. According to data from the Global Business Travel Association, annual business travel is expected to increase by 25% between 2013 and 2018, reaching US$34bn.</p>
<p>On-the-rise business travel brings with it increased demand for solutions to manage travel and entertainment expenses (T&amp;Es). Companies are constantly looking for ways to reduce the costs of managing numerous trips by employees and corporate cards have been the solution-of-choice as they help to alleviate the hassles of organising cash for business trips. This, in turn, helps to reduce administrative costs associated with cash and treasury management.</p>
<p>A study by Fraedom, a spend management system and technology provider which was recently acquired by Visa, showed that 86% of all corporate cards issued have been used in the last 60 days. Companies in different sectors are also increasing their issuance of corporate cards to employees, helping to make multi-currency transactions more seamless.</p>
<p>Beyond the convenience of being just a payment tool, corporate cards backed up by spending management solutions make it easier for employees to streamline expense reporting and monitor adherence to corporate policies.</p>
<p>The complexities of business travel can give rise to a range of compliance issues. For example, business travellers can, unknowingly, trigger additional and unexpected corporate and individual tax obligations. In some cases, taxes and payroll withholdings may be required. It is essential for companies to actively manage or plan ahead of business trips, as penalties and interest can start to accrue, and lead to significant financial impact.</p>
<p>To this end, the use of corporate cards coupled with relevant controls, reporting and expense management solutions allow more control and visibility into T&amp;Es and enable companies to keep track of business travel activities closely. Features such as improved reporting systems can analyse spend data by category, such as expense type and Merchant Category Code, as well as monitor employee compliance with corporate travel policies. They can also create usage parameters to meet strict compliance and regulation requirements.</p>
<p>Concerns over leaks of company information and online payment fraud may also arise as more business trips are booked through online travel and metasearch platforms instead of traditional travel agents. To minimise the risk of exposing company information during online transactions, companies can deploy one-time virtual card solutions which allow for a wide variety of spend controls so the card can only be used for its intended purpose once.</p>
<p>While business travel continues to gain importance, using corporate cards to monitor and control spending helps companies work smarter. This is how companies can minimise the costs incurred and reap the benefits of business travel.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Helping companies meet their go-green targets, enabling organisations to reduce their carbon footprint, and supporting organisations to drive their employee satisfaction scores are some innovative ways in which clients can use their corporate cards. Rather than purely limit the use of corporate cards to the traditional T&amp;E or Business to Business (B2B) procurement programmes, here are some ways in which companies are making the most of the corporate card programmes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Monitoring/reducing carbon footprint and meeting go-green targets:</h5>
<p>Companies have been known to use the rich business intelligence provided by corporate cards to help their environmental and social governance targets through a variety of mechanisms. From mandating public transport (such as train or plane travel) over car hire for long-haul trips, and reducing the use of paper by going electronic (think about how much paper is used in a manual procure-to-pay process), companies can reduce the carbon footprint incurred by business travel and customer statements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Driving employee satisfaction scores by adapting policies to suit traveller needs:</h5>
<p>A leading eCommerce organisation was looking to better manage its business travel expense, while also addressing employee feedback around better work-life balance at the same time. The company changed its travel policy to promote ‘bleisure’ travel, ie to combine business travel with personal time, which brought forward two benefits – i) cheaper weekend business class rates for the organisation and ii) the flexibility for business travel for employees, resulting in significantly improved employee satisfaction scores.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Bridging the consumer/corporate divide:</h5>
<p>As the world grows increasingly electronic, Corporate treasurers demand more of the same experiences on their corporate cards that they can benefit from with their consumer cards. Take, for example, the fact that transport organisations in a number of countries around the world are discouraging or have simply stopped accepting cash. Consumers simply ‘tap’ their contactless credit cards to have the accurate fare deducted on buses and train/subway stations. A natural extension of this need is for business travellers to have the same experience. Another example is the increasing ubiquity and convenience afforded by mobile payment digital wallets to consumers. As the world moves from physical to digital currencies, from physical to digital tokens, so are cards moving from physical to digital formats. Not only are organisations embracing virtual cards, they are also becoming increasingly invisible by being embedded in the travel booking or procure-to-pay process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Maximising the visibility and spend on cards, reaping greater benefits:</h5>
<p>Security and fraud remain top of mind for organisations. However, organisations regularly ‘leak’ millions of dollars in legitimate card usage through the use of alternative payment methods, losing on not just the visibility but also the rebate. The number one reason (by far) for card declines is not fraud, but rather insufficient credit. By simply monitoring usage via a report, companies can drive greater efficiencies in their card programme.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Corporate cards have been around for over half a century and have been a strategic tool in the treasurers’ toolkit to help achieve their goals. As issuers, we owe it to our clients to be more vocal about how corporations and treasurers are making the most of their corporate card programme so that the benefits can be reaped by the entire industry.</p></div>

<br/>
<p>Payment innovation is arguably the big trend right now. In the past decade, activity in the payments space has exploded. Driving this first were regulators looking to build more robust, faster and unified digital payment rails – SEPA and the emergence of instant payment systems are two prime examples.</p>
<p>More recently, fintech firms have delivered a new wave of innovation, building platforms to improve the payments experience. M-Pesa in Kenya, Alipay and WeChat Pay in China are examples of companies that have significantly disrupted payments, especially in the C2C and C2B spaces where they have essentially killed off the use of physical cash.</p>
<h3 id="whats-behind-the-real-time-revolution">What’s behind the real-time revolution?</h3>
<p>To set the scene and understand the drivers behind the real-time revolution in payments, Treasury Today spoke with Jonas Hedman, Associate Professor at the Copenhagen Business School, who is an expert in how digitisation is transforming businesses and society and currently working on a research paper on real-time payments for the SWIFT Institute.</p>
<p><strong>Treasury Today:</strong> What impact are instant payments systems having on businesses and the economy?</p>
<p><strong>Jonas Hedman:</strong> Instant payment systems are having big implications. Most notably they are helping to create a smoother and more efficient economy.</p>
<p>Instant payments are changing how corporates think about cash flow and cash flow planning. This means treasurers must be proactively engaged to ensure that they are managing their cash effectively.</p>
<p>The same is true for banks. The old world was defined on batch processing and cut-off times, meaning that banks could predict how much money would be on their books at the end of the day. In the real-time world, payments happen 24/7 so this is no longer the case. And the implication is that if banks cannot get a control over this, it might make them a bit more reluctant to lend to individuals and businesses.</p>
<p>So, while instant payments are a positive development for end users, there are risks and challenges that the financial ecosystem needs to think through and solve.</p>
<p><strong>Treasury Today:</strong> How might the instant payments space evolve in the coming years?</p>
<p>The world will become real-time and we will see all countries operating an instant payment and clearing infrastructure. There will also be the emergence of more cross-border instant payment systems. What will be most exciting is the value-add services that banks and fintechs build on top of these payment rails. This will be where the next revolution happens.</p>
<h3 id="game-changing-treasury">Game-changing treasury</h3>
<p>The development of instant payment systems is changing the game for corporates and creating plenty of new opportunities. Already, multiple companies have leveraged fintech payment solutions or real-time payment rails to improve their operations, cut costs, mitigate risks and enhance revenue. Companies are also using these payment rails to enhance their customer experience by offering services like real-time refunds.</p>
<p>We are also seeing the emergence of entirely new business models based on real-time payments. For example, in the insurance sector, companies are starting to offer micro-insurance to clients where previously this wasn’t cost effective.</p>
<p>Treasury Today spoke with Carola Schmitz-Becker, Vice President Corporate Treasury at Deutsche Post DHL, to find out how instant payments are providing the foundation for DHL’s treasury to operate in real-time.</p>
<p><strong>Treasury Today:</strong> Why has real-time become such a big topic for your treasury team in recent months?</p>
<p><strong>Carola Schmitz-Becker:</strong> We started investigating this topic last year. Particularly, we are interested in implementing a real-time zero-balancing system that would enable us to do intra-day sweeps from local subsidiary accounts into a master account. This would give us an immediate overview of our aggregated liquidity positions across countries, which would help us better forecast cash flow and deploy free cash.</p>
<p><strong>Treasury Today:</strong> Will using instant payment rails for payments and collections be useful for DHL as well?</p>
<p><strong>Carola Schmitz-Becker:</strong> Yes, instant payments enable us to speed up our operational processes. For example, the earlier we receive a payment from our customer, the sooner we can make the delivery. Also, parcels often get held up in customs because there is a surcharge that must be paid. Instant payment means there is no additional lag introduced to this process and the shipment can get back on the move.</p>
<p>Instant payments are also very applicable to eCommerce. We operate several online shops and I see instant payments and the fact you can debit directly from a customer’s bank account potentially replacing expensive credit cards schemes in this domain, or at least putting pressure on their pricing.</p>
<p><strong>Treasury Today:</strong> What is stopping corporates adopting instant payments?</p>
<p><strong>Carola Schmitz-Becker:</strong> The transaction limits that exist in most instant payment schemes currently limits their applicability to most treasury operations.</p>
<p>Banks must also develop their instant payment offering further. For example, I am yet to find one that interfaces with our ERP system. This is crucial for us in order to deliver efficiency and promote straight-through processing.</p>
<p><strong>Treasury Today:</strong> What will the trend of real-time mean for corporate treasury in the years to come?</p>
<p><strong>Carola Schmitz-Becker:</strong> It is hard to say for sure but I imagine there will be a lot more standardisation and automation in treasury departments. This will likley be driven by new technologies that are fully integrated using APIs, building a digital ecosystem. It might reach the point were treasurers are just dealing with exceptions and spending most of their time focusing on pure strategic matters. It is all very interesting and its an exciting time to be involved in corporate treasury.</p>
<h3 id="staying-on-top">Staying on top</h3>
<p>The impact of instant payments is as big on the banks, who are working hard to bring innovative solutions to their clients. Lothar Meenen, Global Head of Corporate Cash Management Sales at Deutsche Bank outlines the bank’s thinking on this crucial subject.</p>
<p><strong>Treasury Today:</strong> What impact are instant payments having on your clients?</p>
<p><strong>Lothar Meenen:</strong> Instant payments are having a huge impact on our clients. The ability to be paid faster has a positive impact on their working capital metrics, it also helps with liquidity management. Beyond this, instant payments are reshaping our clients’ business models, giving them the opportunity to move into new geographies and business lines.</p>
<p><strong>Treasury Today:</strong> How are instant payments transforming your clients’ business models?</p>
<p><strong>Lothar Meenen:</strong> Instant payments are a game-changer, I can’t stress this enough. And we are already working on some revolutionary projects with clients. For example, we are working on a pilot project with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to reduce the cost of processing payments for airlines. This includes using instant payments and is spurred by the European Union’s Payment Service Directive 2 (PSD2). The result is a payment process that creates much more visibility, reduces cost, enhances control and is quicker for clients.</p>
<p><strong>Treasury Today:</strong> How can treasurers best prepare to operate in a real-time world?</p>
<p><strong>Lothar Meenen:</strong> The real-time world is about more than just payments; it is about real-time FX, liquidity management and other treasury processes. What this means is that it is incredibly important for treasurers to analyse what is happening in their industry to stay ahead of their competitors. There is also a need to engage stakeholders in the business, especially around IT, to make sure that the business is ready to adapt and change in line with market forces. On top of that, treasurers need to develop a real-time mind- and skill-set.</p>
<p>This is a lot of work, but instant payments and real-time treasury are not passing trends, they will become the ‘new normal’. Treasurers must prepare for this.</p></div>

<div class="people right company">
<p><br/>Payments are at the heart of the transformation happening in financial services. Facilitating this is the proliferation of instant payment systems around the world. In Europe, for example, such systems are in use in many of the non-eurozone countries, including the UK, Denmark and Sweden. And within the eurozone, there is SEPA Instant Credit Transfer (SCT Inst), which went live late last year.</p>
<p>For individuals, the value of being able to send payments to beneficiaries at any time, and in less than ten seconds, is clear. Yet for corporate treasurers, the use cases for instant payments are not quite as obvious. However, Francis De Roeck, Head of SEPA offering at BNP Paribas, believes that there is a “hidden dimension to instant payments” that can give treasurers across all industries the chance to “redefine the payments and collections process in their businesses to create immense value”.</p>
<h3 id="payment-use-cases">Payment use cases</h3>
<p>One of the most powerful aspects of instant payments is the fact that payments are settled in real-time. In some industries, this can be revolutionary, enabling the business to offer a much-improved customer experience, says De Roeck. “For example, insurance companies can pay out claims instantly,” he says. “Companies can also quickly and easily offer refunds to unsatisfied clients.”</p>
<p>Internally, the speed of instant payment schemes means that processes can be optimised. Most notably, supplier payments can be synchronised with the production cycle. Payments will no longer be a blocking factor in the supply chain and as a result, just-in-time delivery and payment become a reality, says De Roeck.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the fact that instant payment schemes are always on means that treasurers can be in full control of when they make payments. “Because treasurers no longer need to factor in cut-off times, weekends and bank holidays, corporates can hold onto their liquidity until the last moment,” explains De Roeck. “This streamlines the process for recurring payments substantially and even enables corporates to generate alpha by holding onto their surplus cash a little longer.”</p>
<h3 id="optimising-collections">Optimising collections</h3>
<p>Treasurers can also generate value from instant payment schemes on the collections side of the equation. For example, De Roeck notes that it can reduce the credit risk and the risk associated with handling cash when companies accept payment-on-delivery. “This also increases customer satisfaction as clients will no longer need to pay anything up front because payment can be guaranteed on delivery,” he adds. “Presently, this use case is most impactful for B2C companies, but over time it could replace SEPA Direct Debits for B2B deliveries and payments.”</p>
<p>Additionally, instant payments can transform the checkout experience for customers in both physical and eCommerce stores. “These payment schemes can be very disruptive here, allowing corporates to think about ways to make the payment processes frictionless and even invisible,” says De Roeck.</p>
<h3 id="be-prepared">Be prepared</h3>
<p>Despite the clear benefits of instant payments demonstrated by these use cases, two polls of the audience during the webinar found that, on the whole, treasurers are yet be convinced. “The results from the two polls conducted are not that conclusive as far as the need for instant payments is concerned right now,” comments De Roeck. “However, we might assume that the whole society is moving, via different use cases, to the application and the need for instant payments.”</p>
<p>In the not too distant future, he suggests that we may witness SCT Inst becoming ‘the new norm’, whereby regular payments transacted via a variety of instruments will evolve to instant payments for a range of use cases.</p>
<p>And to that point, De Roeck recommends that corporates start thinking about how the notion of instant payments can impact their operations today. “Even if you are not ready to start using the schemes, your customers will be,” he warns. “As a result, corporates may start receiving payments at unfamiliar times. This will require their processes to be rethought and reengineered.”</p>

<br/>
<p>For every company on the planet, receiving payments is an everyday occurrence. Yet it is an area fraught with challenges. This may be because customers do not pay on time, requiring the seller to chase down payments, wasting valuable time and resources. Or it might be because incoming payments are not easily reconciled, leaving the seller unsure who has paid them and for what.</p>
<p>According to Coralie van Zyl, Head of Product Development Payments and Collections at BNP Paribas, the root of the problem is the friction that often exists in the invoicing and payments process. But it is friction that can, with a few changes, be removed.</p>
<p>Dennie Servranckx, Product Manager Collections at BNP Paribas advises that there are three key areas that corporate sellers can address to improve the buyer’s payment experience, and the likelihood of them paying on time. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Communicate payment instructions clearly and consistently: this will prevent the buyer making mistakes and having to spend time re-entering payment details into their own system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider the payment culture of the payer and adapt to this: there are clear differences in the way corporates in certain countries pay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offer the payer a range of payment methods: forcing a company to act in a certain way can delay payments and even damage the relationship. Analyse customer needs and offer their preferred payment methods.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Addressing these areas can not only ensure corporate sellers are paid on time, they can also help solve the issues sellers face once they have received the payment. For example, van Zyl notes that one of the biggest collections issues for corporates is reconciliation.</p>
<p>“Corporate sellers face challenges here because they are often reliant on the buyer inputting data about the payment in the payment file,” she says. “Typically, this information is either incomplete or not completed at all, leaving the seller in the dark regarding what they have been paid for.” As a result, it is not surprising that over 50% of invoices require some manual intervention, according to a recent client survey by BNP Paribas.</p>
<h4 id="poll-results">Poll results: Are you using data for optimising collections?</h4>
<p><img alt="poll-results-are-you-using-data-for-optimising-collections" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/cash-and-liquidity-management/payments-and-collections/2018-03and04-tt-10-web__poll-results-are-you-using-data-for-optimising-collections__967x200.png?la=en&amp;hash=FDCE20F4E872575F7DF2D5C78C76C2CC"/></p>
<p>Making payments frictionless for the buyer can solve this issue. Indeed, BNP Paribas has found that there is a high level of correlation between frictionless payment methods and high levels of STP collections. Servranckx highlights the use of credit transfers – one of the most common forms of B2B payments – as an example. “These can be very easy to use for the buyer but when wrong or no information is included, there can be a lack of straight through reconciliation for the seller,” he says. “To change this, the seller can start using products such as virtual accounts and begin achieving better reconciliation rates without impacting the buyer’s processes.”</p>
<p>Servranckx further suggests that corporates look at e-invoicing platforms as a way to make life truly frictionless for their customers. “All the payer then has to do is accept the invoice to generate a credit transfer, these are especially effective in the B2C space,” he says. “For the seller, reconciliation is easy because all the information is there.” Direct debit and the acceptance of cards can have the same effect.</p>
<p>To conclude, van Zyl recommends that corporates evaluate their current collections processes to highlight the problems. She then recommends that they put themselves in the shoes of their customers, to find out where the friction is being created. “If you operate in a market where you know credit transfers are popular, for example, then offer that method of payment to your clients,” she says. “You can then supplement this with a virtual account solution to make sure that these payments can be easily reconciled.”</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p>The payments landscape is undergoing a deep and wide transformation, creating the opportunity for innovation. Successful innovative solutions are those that address specific problems that corporates face in paying and collecting their dues domestically and internationally.</p>
<p>For example – India’s large mobile network operator aims to reshape its customers’ payment experience by providing a digital way to pay their phone bills and top up their credit. The operator – who has over 100m telecom subscribers, previously facilitated a traditional way of bills payment and purchases of credit, either through branch or distributors. This posed operational challenges, inconvenience, and delayed realisation for the operator.</p>
<p>To address this problem, the operator opted for Unified Payment Interface (UPI) – a digital solution which enables a payment through a smartphone. The solution empowers its customers with a fast, secure and around the clock payment option, with a wide coverage across the country’s bank accounts. HSBC created an innovative payment solution by combining UPI with a dynamic virtual payment address, which helps to automate the operator’s top-up and bill collections by accurately identifying the payor and the related bill/invoice. The instantaneous transfer of both value and accurate information for millions of users led to significant improvement in operational efficiency, business turnover through faster credit top-up and customer convenience.</p>
<p>On another front, advancing globalisation has enabled corporates to manage a larger base of international suppliers/customers, and this, in turn, has encouraged the growth of cross-border open payments. This can be linked to a real case study, where an Australia-based travel platform found that their supplier payments processes were inefficient and risky. Following significant growth and successful expansion, the customer had to manage several accounts opened in different markets and realised that they were making a higher volume of small payments to suppliers in different countries and currencies, using expensive and error-prone cross-border payment mechanisms.</p>
<p>Recognising that the process was too cumbersome to manage, HSBC proposed an innovative payment solution which simplifies global payments and minimises the cross-border banking fees through direct access to domestic clearing systems, using a product called Global Disbursement. The solution is aligned to the customer’s centralisation strategy, enabling them to make cross-border payments using only one account – one remittance file for multiple payments distributed globally in different currencies. This, in turn, helped the customer to improve efficiency through streamlined payment processes, reducing transaction costs by utilising in-country accounts and giving them greater control over payment flows.</p>
<p>Innovation in payments is rapidly developing, driven by evolving patterns of consumer and corporate needs. As the journey of the payment innovation progresses, the best value will be achieved from solutions that unearth and address the unmet and anticipated needs of corporates.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Asia Pacific continues to push the boundaries of technology. The region is fast becoming a hotbed for fintech innovation, including new payments initiatives rolled out by both the public and private sector. McKinsey predicts that by 2020, the global payments industry will generate an estimated US$2.2trn in revenue, over US$400bn more than the figure for 2015 (US$1trn).</p>
<p>While it all seems promising, unfortunately, historically there has been a lack of solutions for today’s corporates that address the issues of speed and transparency when it comes to payments. Today, customers are demanding not only faster settlement, but also improved customer service around their international transfers. It’s often difficult to track and trace cross-border payments as there is no confirmation or receipt of payment by the beneficiary, and most of the time they are not reflected real-time.</p>
<p>Banks are starting to address this issue by offering an enhanced cross-border payments experience to their corporate customers. Recently, DBS became the first bank in Singapore and Hong Kong to execute cross-border payments with end-to-end corporate payments tracking in these two markets, leveraging on the SWIFT global payments innovation (gpi) service. Gpi is a solution that resulted from a collaboration between SWIFT and the global banking community, which has rapidly become the new standard in cross-border payments. Since January 2017, more than 120 leading transaction banks have signed up, 30 of which are already live and performing real transactions using the service. To-date, over three and a half million payments have been processed using SWIFT gpi.</p>
<p>In the past, corporates and SMEs have struggled to track cross-border payments, as these transactions are routed through multiple banks, with different processing times that can take up to five days. Gpi payments are credited within 24 hours from initiation – mostly within a few hours and even minutes – which means corporates can now track their payments in real-time and get confirmation of that credit directly from their banks. This is made possible by an innovative payments tracker that comes with gpi. The Tracker is a cloud-based application accessible via APIs, and banks are using these APIs to embed the gpi Tracker information into their payments flow applications and front-end platforms.</p>
<p>While the current first phase of gpi focuses on business-to-business payments and helping corporates grow their international business, the second phase will include additional digital services to further transform the cross-border payment experience, such as the ability to immediately stop and recall a payment, no matter where it is in the correspondence banking chain.</p>
<p>The financial industry is facing unprecedented changes, driven by regulation, customer demand and technology evolution. Globalisation and digitalisation have encouraged companies of all sizes and sectors to internationalise their businesses. However, under the current correspondent banking model, banks need to monitor their overseas accounts via debit and credit updates and end-of-day statements, causing inefficiencies and significant costs along the way. Already, gpi banks are exploring how distributed ledger technology could help speed up the reconciliation of their nostro accounts. Innovation is an ongoing process, but to start with, corporates need to be equipped with the right solutions to enable better cash flow management and increased speed and visibility on critical payments.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Payments innovation is a hot topic for discussion due to the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The rise of the platform application based economy – the reality is that the financial supply chain (making payments and receipts) has fallen behind the on-demand/real-time international service models followed by corporates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multi-regional regulatory push for creating 24/7 real-time domestic payment rails and open banking via APIs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The potential for a better tomorrow through the technology that made bitcoin possible – distributed ledger technology.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These factors, combined with the lack of significant changes to the incumbent infrastructure for payments since incubation, make it ripe for disruption by fintech firms with a fresh pair of eyes.</p>
<p>Corporates making payments have a need to ensure that solutions provided are reliable and timely. These mission-critical examples of moving money define how an organisation is perceived in terms of ease of doing business with. This explains corporates’ inclination towards improving the certainty and timeliness of transactions. The expectation is that primary financial intermediaries, which are predominantly banks, are to improve the way payments are made.</p>
<p>Though a bulk of corporate payments are still going through payments rails with their banking partners, some early adopters are experimenting with new payment technologies directly with fintech firms for both cross-border and domestic payments. As their financial services partner, banks are held accountable to provide tested, reliable and secure connections to new value transfer networks.</p>
<p>Standard Chartered is helping its clients, corporates and institutions alike, by providing multiple payment methods given the nature of the supply chains they transact in. The drive to provide a wider payment optionality, via our payment connections, is a key component to becoming the core bank for our corporate client relationships. This need led to the development of the bank’s proprietary connections to over 17 mobile wallet partners in 14 markets as these services have become more relevant and significant for commercial B2B, C2B and B2C payments.</p>
<p>Understanding the importance of collaboration and co-creation, we are also working along with the corporates and third-party providers. For example, the bank is integrating its existing infrastructure to enable payments through social networks payments networks such as WeChat and 24/7 real-time payment channels like UPI.</p>
<p>Two other initiatives that Standard Chartered is involved in are our collaboration with SWIFT gpi and RippleNet. SWIFT gpi through its existing infrastructure has a much wider industry adoption, RippleNet is a redesign of the existing cross-border payments infrastructure.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>The biggest trend in financial services right now is not fintech nor the blockchain; it is the move from batch to real-time. This is the view of Tony McLaughlin, Managing Director, Emerging Payments and Business Development, Treasury and Trade Solutions at Citi. In this article, he charts a course for the payments industry, providing some action points for treasurers.</p>

<p>When the UK launched Faster Payments in 2008, it ushered in a new era for payments around the world: the age of real-time had begun. Many other countries soon followed suit, announcing the completion of their own instant payment rails. By 2020 faster payments will be ubiquitous in all major markets.</p>
<p>The proliferation of digital businesses and the rise of eCommerce has been the key driving force behind this rise. Businesses thrive when they offer their customers a quick, efficient and user-friendly payment method. They have demanded changes in the infrastructure to facilitate this. Regulators have responded, mandating the development of payment rails to ensure that they keep their economies functioning and competitive by supporting digital business.</p>
<h3 id="riding-the-real-time-rails">Riding the real-time rails</h3>
<p>The emergence of instant payments is having a profound impact on the services that banks such as Citi can offer its corporate clients. To provide an example, Tony McLaughlin, Managing Director, Emerging Payments and Business Development, Treasury and Trade Solutions at Citi, cites how the bank is providing eCommerce companies in India with the ability to use a non-card collection method. The solution leverages India’s Unified Payment Interface (UPI) and enables eCommerce companies to pull cash directly from their customer’s bank accounts in real-time using a tokenised address, such as an email address or phone number.</p>
<p>“This is a powerful tool for eCommerce companies in India,” says McLaughlin. “It enables them to reach an entirely new ‘un-carded’ client base. It reduces costs as they will no longer have to pay an ad valorum fee to use card rails. It also mitigates fraud and charge-back risk.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Citi is helping the new wave of digital providers to grow their businesses. It is providing them with access to faster payment rails, “reducing the friction between the bank account and the merchant, improving the user experience”. Citi is plugged into 12 faster payment schemes around the world, allowing it to offer access on a global basis to these companies.</p>
<p>Traditional businesses are benefiting from instant payments. Insurance companies, for instance, are using faster payment rails to credit their customers more quickly when there is a claim, removing friction when dealing with their clients. Something similar is happening in the aviation industry, where airlines are using faster payments to offer their customers refunds or compensation.</p>
<p>Yet despite the benefits that instant payment rails are already offering companies in certain segments, corporate usage remains minimal. McLaughlin notes that there is little benefit in paying faster for B2B businesses but this should not mean that they should ignore faster payment rails, as these do more than move money faster: they also move more data using ISO 20022 XML-based messaging, which provides more scope for transfer of information as well as value.</p>
<h3 id="the-search-for-transparency-and-efficiency">The search for transparency and efficiency</h3>
<p>Increasing the data flow and offering more transparency through the payments process is a core tenet of SWIFT’s global payments innovation (GPI) initiative. Launched earlier this year, GPI provides corporates with the ability to track payment status end-to-end.</p>
<p>“Corporates have long been calling for these characteristics, especially the ability to track and trace payments,” says McLaughlin. “This is clearly a positive development that will give our clients greater visibility and control over their payments,” he adds. The challenge though will be moving the banking industry onto GPI and gaining critical mass so that clients can have a consistent payment experience around the world.</p>
<p>Although a positive step, McLaughlin is calling for a more dramatic change in the industry. “Banks have always been able to provide corporates with payment notifications, using SWIFT ACK [acknowledgement] messages,” he says. “As an industry, we decided to only send messages for those payments that failed and worked in the mode of management by exception.”</p>
<p>The reason for this, explains McLaughlin, is because of the shortcomings of the legacy banking infrastructure. The banking industry today is built on batch processing, with long, end-of-day cycles and store-and-forward messaging on the SWIFT FIN network. “Even if we did send these ACK messages for all payments, they still wouldn’t provide corporates with the real-time information they desire.”</p>
<p>Indeed, McLaughlin notes that this legacy way of working dramatically limits banks’ ability to offer the services that corporates are demanding, beyond track and trace. “To upgrade our services in a meaningful way, the whole industry needs to move from batch to real-time processing. Everywhere we look, this change is occurring and banks need to act.”</p>
<h3 id="hyperconnected-open-banking">Hyperconnected open banking</h3>
<p>Linked to the move from batch processing to real-time is the transformative way that banks, corporates and clearing systems are connecting. “We are entering an age of hyperconnectivity, delivered through APIs, that facilitates real-time banking,” says McLaughlin. “Soon, every bank and every clearing system will be accessible through APIs.”</p>
<p>In Europe, this trend is driven by PSD2. “The banking infrastructure will be opened up to non-bank players using APIs,” he explains. “This is unleashing creativity, especially in the fintech world, and it will transform the payments landscape.”</p>
<p>Individuals thinking about the impact of PSD2, should look at what has happened in China. “The dominant mobile money players in China are not banks, they are technology companies that have built applications that overlay the traditional financial infrastructure,” he explains. “PSD2 in Europe will allow technology companies to do the same thing.”</p>
<p>Although this might seem like a threat to the banks, McLaughlin highlights that it does not have to be. “If banks focus on just being PSD2 compliant, which many are, then this could be extremely damaging for them,” he says. “What they should be thinking is what services they deliver over and above the minimum that will offer value to their clients. If they don’t, the fintechs will.”</p>
<p>For McLaughlin, it is about banks thinking strategically about their offerings, and exposing all these micro services to the world through APIs. McLaughlin notes how Alipay in China provides a good example of this. “It is embedded in lots of ecosystems enabling it to provide data to companies who can thereby improve their customer experience.”</p>
<p>In Europe, McLaughlin highlights how banks could step in and offer finance at the point of sale online. Using APIs, banks could expose their credit services to merchants, enabling them to offer their customers the ability to pay now or pay later – using bank credit – when checking out online. “Everybody wins in this example: merchants can potentially increase sales by offering finance and a seamless user experience; customers will be happy because they have options when making a purchase; and banks will be able to make money by financing the transaction.”</p>
<h3 id="corporate-action">Corporate action</h3>
<p>In this time of change in the payments space, there is a lot for corporates to be thinking about. “I would recommend that corporates speak to their banks about their API strategies,” says McLaughlin. “Most importantly, they should be encouraging them to work with other banks to create a standard set of APIs for the industry – this is crucial. Otherwise, multi-banked corporates will face lots of different integrations, increasing the complexity and potentially limiting the benefit that these can offer.”</p>
<p>Finally, McLaughlin recommends that corporates cut through all the noise around payments and focus on the developments that will really benefit their operations. “There is so much opportunity that can be unlocked in the payment industry,” he concludes. “But it is important to focus on the solutions that are solving problems and not get caught up in the noise created by those solutions looking for problems.”</p>
<p>The emergence of instant payment rails is just one aspect of the entire payment industry’s move from batch to real-time processing, says McLaughlin. “This is the real mega-trend.”</p>
<div class="boxed">
<h3 id="do-not-forget-blockchain">Do not forget blockchain</h3>
<p>It would be remiss to talk about payments without mentioning the blockchain. At present, there are many companies looking to overhaul the existing payments ecosystem using the technology. McLaughlin says that Citi is actively exploring applications of blockchain and has supported clients such as Nasdaq who have built their own blockchain ecosystems.</p>
<p>“Blockchain may find its greatest application in domains where the counterparties don’t trust each other and are poor at record-keeping. This is not a description of the payments world,” says McLaughlin. “Payment systems are comprised of two elements – messaging and settlement. We are investigating whether blockchain based solutions are superior in either of these two layers, but so far results are inconclusive. Meanwhile, the real revolution is taking place in the emergence of real time payments, open banking and APIs.”</p>
<p>McLaughlin advises that it would be unwise to ignore blockchain as the technology is still in the early stages of development and there are several examples of foundational technologies that went through long gestation periods, such as the relational database, first invented in 1970 but only properly commercialised in 1979.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>From SEPA to FAST and from gpi to Ripple, innovation in the payments landscape is occurring faster than ever before. Whilst this disruption makes the future of payments somewhat uncertain, ultimately the real winners will be corporates who can look forward to a faster, cheaper and more seamless payments experience. Treasury Today explores some of the latest developments.</em></p>
<p>At the end of last year, the first Amazon Go grocery store in Seattle opened its doors. Described as a “just walk out” shopping experience, the store is revolutionary because it enables customers to simply take what they want off the shelves and walk out of the store without the need to queue at a checkout and make a payment.</p>
<p>Amazon has not started providing free groceries – instead, it has created what might be the world’s first frictionless payments experience. This works by using various technologies that detect which products a customer has picked from the shelf. These are then registered to a digital cart (found on the Amazon Go app). Then, when the customer leaves the store, this is recognised in the app and the digital cart is turned into an invoice that triggers an instant payment across the Amazon Payments service.</p>
<p>It is a fascinating case study, and one that highlights not only how technology is changing the way everyday tasks are conducted, but also how seamless the payment experience can be.</p>
<h3 id="payments-in-vogue">Payments: in vogue</h3>
<p>Amazon is by no means the only organisation to be focusing on payments. Indeed, the payments space has become saturated of late as an assortment of banks, credit card companies, fintechs, central banks and other industry players look to remove friction and make paying a more seamless experience.</p>
<p>This is hardly surprising: solving payment problems can be very rewarding. The Boston Consulting Group, for instance, predicts that payments revenues could grow to more than US$2trn a year by 2023. As a result, venture capital money has been ploughed into the industry.</p>
<p>The focus of these companies has so far been on the retail space and customer-facing businesses have been the first to feel the impact of these developments, especially the need to accommodate a plethora of new payment methods. But the rise of these alternative payment methods, whilst receiving a lot of the mainstream media coverage, is arguably just the tip of the iceberg when talking about the broader transformations happening in the space.</p>
<h3 id="sepa-looking-back">SEPA: looking back</h3>
<p>Innovation in payments isn’t new, despite the recent popularity and the excitement drummed up by fintech. As Mark Evans, Global Head of Payments Advisory, Global Liquidity and Cash Management at HSBC highlights: “SEPA remains one of the biggest development in the payments space of recent times.”</p>
<p>Indeed, SEPA has been important for a whole host of reasons, but one of the most notable has been its role in establishing ISO 20022 XML as a payment messaging standard. “A common messaging infrastructure is important and the benefits of creating this have been highlighted by SEPA,” says Evans. “And as more and more domestic payment systems are built using similar XML standards, banks are able to standardise payments processing and focus on delivering more innovative experience to our clients.”</p>
<p>Aside from setting standards, SEPA helped get the banks (and corporates) thinking differently about payments. As Evans explains: “The execution of payments is now heavily commoditised and what corporates are really interested in is what value banks can add before and after payment execution.” Banks have been working on ‘additional optional services’, which can be developed in order to add value to clients’ payments processes.</p>
<p>Indeed, Evans notes that the success of SEPA has created challenges for corporates operating elsewhere in the world. “We often run into challenges, where our clients expect SEPA-like capabilities and are disappointed to find they are unable to routinely replicate this operating model elsewhere,” he says.</p>
<p>The evolution of SEPA doesn’t stop here, however, and Evans highlights how banks are increasing their focus on overlay services. He notes that HSBC is working to help its corporate clients further improve their payments efficiency, for instance. “We are working to develop solutions that help clients more efficiently manage accounts associated with payment execution, and remove the operational burden associated with so called, payments Master Data,” Evans explains.</p>
<h3 id="life-in-the-fast-lane">Life in the fast lane</h3>
<p>Away from SEPA, a more recent trend in the payments space has been the proliferation of faster payment systems. The UK was a first-mover in this instance when it launched its Faster Payments scheme in May 2008. Since then, over 30 similar systems have been developed or are under development around the world.</p>
<p>Faster payment schemes enable customers to make electronic payments almost instantaneously, seven days a week and 24 hours a day. Payments are typically made via a phone or internet-enabled device and involve the transfer of money between accounts – to pay other people, pay bills or make regular standing order payments.</p>
<p>Interestingly, while SEPA has set the standard for pan-regional payments, it is Asia Pacific that is arguably setting the standard for real-time domestic payment systems. Some notable solutions in the region include Fast and Secure Transfers (FAST) a real-time payments initiative from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, built using ISO 20022; India’s Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) and UPI; and the soon to launch New Payments Platform (NPP) in Australia.</p>
<p>These payment systems are the building blocks on which further payments innovation can be built – many of which the banks are just beginning to explore. Yet, it is important to note that whilst these are exciting developments, the impact of these systems in the corporate space remains limited. Many schemes, for instance, enforce maximum value limits (S$50,000 in Singapore, for example), reducing their usefulness to corporates making high-value payments.</p>
<p>It is also debatable whether corporates need the ability to make real-time payments at all. After all, in the B2B space companies typically have standard cycles for payments based on overnight settlement. Perhaps one of the most transformational effects of Faster payment schemes is their support for “Request for Payment” services using mobile phone numbers, emails or other aliass. Ironically, it could be that Faster payments make their biggest impact for corporates on the receivable side of their business.</p>
<h3 id="swifts-gpi-initiative">SWIFT’s gpi initiative</h3>
<p>Although domestic faster payment systems may only have a limited impact on corporate operations, the developments occurring in the cross-border space – where often the real challenges sit – may have a more immediate effect.</p>
<p>Indeed, the increase in the volume of cross-border payments, driven by globalisation, and the digitisation of commerce has only increased the volume of cross-border payments for corporates. When sending payments cross-border, corporates often struggle with transparency over the payments in terms of fees and credit confirmation. There is also limited remittance data that can be sent along with the payment, creating issues when it comes to reconciliation.</p>
<p>It is these cross-border challenges that SWIFT’s global payments innovation (gpi) initiative is looking to solve for treasurers. Launched in early 2015, the gpi initiative is intended to improve corporate treasurers’ experiences when making cross-border payments by increasing speed, transparency and end-to-end tracking of transactions. The initiative aims to do this by establishing a service agreement for banks, which will then be responsible for turning this into a value proposition for their clients.</p>
<p>Despite the widespread focus on new technology, SWIFT has bucked the trend and designed the gpi initiative to work without significant changes to existing infrastructure. “This was a very deliberate action,” says Wim Raymaekers, Global Head of Banking Market at SWIFT. “We want to bring the benefits of gpi to treasurers as soon as possible and the existing technological infrastructure enables this.” To that point, SWIFT and the banks – perhaps rather uncharacteristically – have been rapid in pushing forward with gpi, which went live in February.</p>
<p>That isn’t to say that SWIFT hasn’t been innovating. “Providing same day value and transparency over fees is done by enforcing the new standards,” explains Raymaekers. “But we have introduced some new tools to enable the end-to-end payments tracking function and built a data layer that flows with the payment, enabling the transaction of rich remittance data. The aim of this technology is to enable the ‘DHL of payments’ – something that corporates have been requesting for some time.”</p>
<p>With over 90 banks already on board, gpi is an initiative that SWIFT is promising will further improve as time goes on. “We have already helped solve a number of challenges that corporates face when making cross-border payments,” says Raymaekers. “And we will continue to develop gpi utilising new technology as and when it comes available. Decoupling the business rules from the technology has enabled this and will mean that gpi will be able to stand the test of time.”</p>
<p>To provide just one example, Raymaekers says that SWIFT has launched a proof of concept (PoC) to explore whether distributed ledger technology (DLT) can be used by banks to improve the reconciliation of their nostro databases in real time, optimising their global liquidity.</p>
<h3 id="breaking-the-rules">Breaking the rules</h3>
<p>There are those, however, that believe the existing payments ecosystem needs to be renewed for any true progress to be made. Ripple is probably the most vocal company in this space. Its vision is to create something that it calls the ‘Internet of Value’. As Daniel Aranda, Managing Director of Ripple Europe, explains: “We believe that value can be moved around the world the same way as data, seamlessly and instantly.”</p>
<p>For those at Ripple, the issue with the current payments ecosystem is that it relies on central master ledgers to track who owns what and who has paid who. “These ledgers sit within banks, broker-dealers, central banks, clearing systems – and when payments need to go cross-border, this system starts to break down because these ledgers don’t easily interoperate,” says Aranda. “As a result, international payments take from three to five days to settle and have an error rate of 5%. This means that making payments between countries is slow, unreliable and expensive.”</p>
<p>The result is a payments infrastructure that Aranda says is “woefully inadequate to meet the corporate treasurer’s needs – in particular, that of managing liquidity and foreign exchange risk and having real-time data to hand.”</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p>So how does Ripple and its ‘Internet of Value’ seek to change this? Its technology is built around an open neutral protocol called the Interledger Protocol (ILP), which standardises the process of settling transactions across different ledgers and networks. This offers cryptographically secure end-to-end payments flow with transaction immutability that allows companies on different networks to transact directly.</p>
<p>Contrary to some beliefs, Ripple is not looking to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Its technology is designed to fit within a bank’s existing infrastructure and complies with risk, privacy and compliance requirements.</p>
<p>“With the ability to transact directly, instantly and with certainty of settlement through Ripple’s distributed financial technology, corporate treasurers have much to gain,” says Aranda. This includes the ability to direct funds immediately as and when needed to support operations globally as well as support all currencies from centralised accounts. Treasurers will also be able to reduce counterparty risk and credit costs by having the option to request for immediate payments from customers and improve cash management and reduce working capital and liquidity costs. Finally, reconciliation errors can be minimalised through detailed invoice data.</p>
<p>“2016 was the year that banks began to accept distributed ledger technology to be used for commercial payment solutions, particularly in cross-border payments,” concludes Aranda. “2017 could be the year that financial institutions increase the adoption of digital assets like Ripple’s XRP to fund their payments in real time and, in the process, cut down their dependency on nostro accounts.”</p>
<h3 id="moving-in-the-right-direction">Moving in the right direction</h3>
<p>With so much innovation under way, and more still to come, it is extremely difficult to predict exactly what the payments ecosystem will look like in ten years’ time. Indeed, technology is moving so fast that ten years ago, the term ‘distributed ledger’ did not exist in conversations around payments.</p>
<p>SEPA and Faster Payments, as government-led initiatives, are clearly here to stay, and they should provide the underlying architecture for payments innovation to truly flourish. Exactly what rails cross-border payments will travel on is less certain.</p>
<p>For corporate treasurers, the new payments landscape might seem overly complex and uncertain. There are a lot of moving parts and a lot of players in the game. Consolidation is clearly needed: a situation with multiple systems at play is not the most efficient scenario.</p>
<p>But with a 2016 Saxo Payments study indicating that 63% of finance professionals were not satisfied with how long international transfers take to arrive in the recipient’s account, the good news is that all these developments aim to streamline the payments space, making it faster and cheaper for corporates to transact both domestically and cross-border.</p>
<p>Any diligent treasury professional will, therefore, be keeping well abreast of these changes and should be engaging with their banking partners closely. Treasurers should also talk to other industry players such as SWIFT and Ripple to see what is out there and the benefits these new systems can bring.</p></div>

<br/>
<p style="clear:both;">Corporate treasury departments have long been under pressure to improve working capital metrics. The easiest and most practical area to improve has typically been the procure-to-pay side of the equation. Treasurers have therefore tended to focus on this area, centralising, streamlining and driving efficiency across the accounts payables (AP) process.</p>
<p>The same cannot be said for the order-to-cash side of the working capital equation, which has proved a notoriously complex area to centralise and automate. With many treasury teams and shared service centres (SSCs) already short of resources, accounts receivables (AR) has become increasingly burdensome as considerable time and effort is tied up in reconciliation and cash application processes. To alleviate this, some corporates have drafted in local teams to handle reconciliation activity. Indeed, Citi Treasury Diagnostic Research highlights that approximately 50% of the bank’s clients manage receivables processing/cash application at the country level. But there are questions as to how sustainable this method is.</p>
<p>Corporate treasury teams are recognising that this is the case and as Ireti Samuel-Ogbu, EMEA Head of Payments &amp; Receivables, Treasury and Trade Solutions at Citi comments, treasurers are becoming increasingly focused on “speeding up and building efficiency into the order-to-cash cycle”. It is an intelligent move because even minor improvements can have a multitude of benefits including significant cost savings, freeing up credit lines and enhanced working capital.</p>
<p>How, though, can the complexity of streamlining AR be overcome and what tools are available to enable treasurers to realise the benefits of AR optimisation?</p>
<h3 id="barriers-to-efficiency">Barriers to efficiency</h3>
<p>Before analysing the strategies and tools available, Samuel-Ogbu says that it is important to understand fully the challenges that stand in the way. These challenges are interlinked, but perhaps core to many companies’ struggles is the disconnect between the settlement and invoicing process. “This disconnect means that it is often not clearly apparent who has paid and for what,” says Samuel-Ogbu. “So from an accounting perspective the money is unreconciled.”</p>
<p>This disconnect exacerbates the second issue faced by many corporations: a lack of straight through reconciliation (STR). Samuel-Ogbu highlights that the AR process of many corporates is highly inefficient, with teams of people required to match receipts to AR ledgers manually and deal with exceptions. This is often driven by a lack of data standardisation through clearing, truncation issues and inefficient client payment behaviour.</p>
<p>Indeed, as companies expand their geographical footprints around the world, the challenge only becomes more acute. “Even though we are in an era defined by digitisation and innovation, we must remember that in the vast majority of countries, especially in the emerging markets, cash and cheques remain king,” says Samuel-Ogbu. “Cash, by default, has to be manually managed and this adds risk, time and inefficiency to the AR process.”</p>
<p>A further issue is the large number of bank accounts and banking partners that corporates may adopt during global expansion. “Collecting receipts in multiple currencies is a challenge in itself. But if you overlay that with a multitude of accounts with different banks, that just adds to the cost, complexity and lack of standardisation across the AR process,” says Samuel-Ogbu.</p>
<h3 id="going-digital">Going digital</h3>
<p>Given the broad scope of these challenges there is, unfortunately, no silver bullet. However, the interlinked nature of the obstacles does mean that solving one problem opens the door to solving another. As organisations of all shapes and sizes increasingly shift their business models onto digital platforms, treasury teams are being presented with opportunities to remove paper from AR processes – the first step when looking to optimise this area.</p>
<p>“A number of platforms have been developed that help digitise paper invoices, for instance,” says John Walsh, EMEA Head of Domestic Payments &amp; Receivables, Treasury and Trade Solutions at Citi. “Whilst creating some efficiency, it only solves part of the problem. The invoice flow is still disconnected from the settlement of the payment, meaning that manual reconciliation still has to take place.” Cash and cheque receipts also warrant manual reconciliation.</p>
<p>The need to look beyond ‘traditional’ payment methods is a must for corporates looking to streamline AR. “This goes beyond simply being an efficiency play,” says Walsh. “Offering digital collection channels and managing receivables more efficiently potentially offers the business, especially as it moves to online channels, the opportunity to improve its sales and customer experience.”</p>
<p>Even in those instances where it remains impossible for cash to be completely eliminated, Citi is working hard to ensure companies can still streamline their AR processes. “In the Middle East, Africa and Eastern and Central Europe we are piloting a solution that enables our corporate clients to deposit cash they have received into a machine on their premises,” says Walsh. “This provides our clients with a ‘digital’ experience because the cash deposit is instantly shown in their accounts along with the information they inputted around the payment.”</p>
<h3 id="bringing-it-all-together">Bringing it all together</h3>
<p>Whichever method the treasury department adopts to switch from paper to electronic receipts, the result is the opportunity to leverage a host of solutions that can help streamline and automate AR. Virtual accounts are a powerful tool in this area and can help treasurers rationalise the number of physical accounts held, as well as addressing AR and reconciliation issues.</p>
<p>In the case of Citi’s offering, Samuel-Ogbu explains that the solution works by using an automated payer identification service that begins with the bank assigning unique account numbers to its client’s payers. The individual account numbers can then be created within the ERP system for all the client’s payers. These ‘virtual accounts’ are shared with the bank for identification purposes. “Payers can then initiate payments to their virtual account number, which Citi will process and automatically link to the client’s real account number,” Samuel-Ogbu says. “This is then credited with the payment and identifies who the payer is, which helps the reconciliation and cash application process.”</p>
<p>This goes a long way to solving AR issues for Citi’s clients. But to further enhance the solution, the bank has also developed its unique AR matching service that overlays the payer identification tool. The solution consolidates payment data in an electronic report and uploads it directly to the client’s ERP system, which auto matches the data and highlights any exceptions. As well as accelerating collections, the solution eliminates the need to match and manage receivables manually.</p>
<p>“If you pair these solutions together then you have an incredibly powerful tool that automates the matching of the invoice and settlement – the key issue when dealing with reconciliation,” notes Walsh.</p>
<h3 id="linking-trade-finance-value-add">Linking trade finance: value add</h3>
<p>The potential for treasury to add further value does not stop there, however. Citi’s focus on this area has seen the bank find innovative ways to add further value to what its clients are doing. “When discussing virtual accounts these are often talked about as being the zenith,” says Samuel-Ogbu. “But what is often overlooked is that further improvement to the working capital cycle can be sought by overlaying a virtual account/receivables matching solution with trade finance tools.”</p>
<p>When it comes to speeding up DSO, Samuel-Ogbu adds, “having the ability through these solutions to demonstrate to the bank that you know exactly who is paying you and for what, enables you to use discounting more strategically. This really transforms the AR process from a burdensome task to one that can add significant value to the bottom line.”</p>
<h3 id="the-time-is-now">The time is now</h3>
<p>For the many treasury professionals who have previously struggled to solve AR issues, the promise of these solutions may be viewed with some degree of cynicism. Walsh can understand this: “It has only been in the last one to two years that all of these elements have come together to create a true value-adding proposition for our clients,” he says. “Before now there were still issues that meant adopting similar solutions required a little too much work.”</p>
<p>But with the solutions now available in 40 markets across EMEA and Asia, Samuel-Ogbu states that “now is the time for treasurers to begin taking advantage of what is on offer”. Working with a bank that has a global network can be “particularly advantageous” as well, she says. “The fact that Citi has local capabilities in over 90 countries means that we are able to handle local collections for our clients, feed these into our reconciliation tools and then provide a consistency and richness of data back to the corporate treasury and SSC.”</p>
<p>Samuel-Ogbu also states that Citi’s global footprint gives the bank a distinct advantage when developing further solutions for clients operating globally and receiving in multiple currencies. “We are exploring a centralised collection solution where our clients can receive funds in multiple currencies and then select these to automatically be converted into their operational currency – removing further complexity from the AR process.”</p>
<p>Treasurers may also be interested to hear that Citi’s focus on AR doesn’t stop there. The bank is actively developing a number of different solutions, including evolving its virtual ledger solution. It is also exploring how APIs can impact this space and developing a consolidated reporting tool that corporates can use to manage all their receipts.</p>
<p>Finally, the proliferation of faster payment schemes around the world may provide further opportunities for corporates. “We are exploring ways that we can provide our clients with an instantaneous collection mechanism along these rails,” concludes Samuel-Ogbu. “It could be revolutionary, watch this space.”</p></div>

<br/>
<p>At BNP Paribas’ Cash Management University in May 2016, a poll was conducted of the 200 corporate treasurers in attendance before and after a presentation on SWIFT’s global payments innovation (gpi) initiative. Treasurers were twice asked the question: what do you think will be the biggest disruptive force in the payments landscape in the coming years? Before the presentation, SWIFT gpi polled barely a handful of votes. After the presentation, it was the near unanimous winner.</p>
<p>“At the start, treasurers didn’t know precisely what SWIFT gpi was about so they didn’t vote for it,” says Wim Grosemans, Head of Product Management International Payments, BNP Paribas. “But after we had finished explaining what it means, well, then everyone wanted it.” The story shows just how excited treasurers become once they learn what SWIFT gpi is setting out to achieve. So, for the benefit of any treasurers still in the dark, what exactly is SWIFT gpi?</p>
<h3 id="a-game-changer-for-cross-border-payments">A game changer for cross-border payments</h3>
<p>In simple terms, SWIFT gpi is a SWIFT-led initiative gathering 70+ banks across the globe (which represents the vast majority of worldwide payments volume) intended to improve corporate treasurers’ experience when making cross-border payments by increasing speed, transparency and end-to-end tracking of transactions. A forerunner to the initiative, BNP Paribas is also a very active member of the panel of 20 leading banks who signed up as SWIFT gpi pilots. Treasurers have long suffered from inefficiencies when making cross-border payments. Unlike domestic payments, the processing of cross-border payments is dependent upon not just the debtor and creditor banks, but also different correspondent banks and, potentially, different clearing systems. The lack of synchronisation is a source of errors and delays that creates more work for the corporate treasurer.</p>
<p>Through collaboration with the banks signed up to the initiative, a new set of strict business rules has been developed to make the process much smoother. It will mean that banks will be able to offer a greatly enhanced payments service to their corporate clients, one that boasts same day use of funds, transparency of fees, end-to-end payments tracking and the certainty to have remittance information transferred unaltered. Each bank will have the responsibility to translate the innovation brought by SWIFT gpi into a value proposition for their customers. Given the opportunities these improvements will present to treasurers to more efficiently manage their cash positions and improve working capital management, it is, perhaps, no wonder that the initiative is causing such a stir in the treasury community. “Ultimately, the initiative is designed for the corporate treasurer,” says Wim Raymaekers, Global Head of Banking Market at SWIFT, “and we think it will improve their lives exponentially.”</p>
<h3 id="building-on-existing-technology">Building on existing technology</h3>
<p>Treasurers will be pleased to hear that they will not have long to wait either. Results from the pilot launched earlier this year are to be presented at Sibos, SWIFT’s annual financial services conference, with the service set to go live in early 2017. Raymaekers says that one of the key reasons SWIFT has been able to make SWIFT gpi a reality in such a short space of time is the decision to not pin everything on still-nascent technologies – like blockchain – that are going to require a lot more time to develop. While Grosemans and Raymaekers are as excited as everyone else in the industry about blockchain, for the time being SWIFT gpi will focus on the technology banks have in place today. Additional innovations will be incorporated into SWIFT gpi as and when new technologies become ready to deploy. Continuous improvement is a key feature of SWIFT gpi.</p>
<p>“We made a conscious decision at the start of this initiative to first gather banks to design solutions on the existing technology,” says Grosemans. “That was the only way we would be able to develop a solution quickly that would have benefits for the corporate treasurer.”</p>
<p>As SWIFT and the banks consider how the solution will develop, Grosemans would like to encourage corporate treasurers to join the discussion. “We are extending an open hand to corporate treasurers. We want them to be included in the conversation so that we make sure we are addressing the pain points that are important to them and bringing relevant added-value. Ultimately, we are doing this for them. But the founding fathers are indeed the banks, and it is for us to work together before taking our innovation to the market.</p>
<h3 id="corporates-to-join-in-the-conversation">Corporates to join in the conversation</h3>
<p>Referring back to BNP Paribas Cash Management University, Grosemans says the need to involve corporate treasurers in the development of SWIFT gpi is one of the reasons why industry events are so important in terms of raising awareness in the treasury community. “After the presentation, SWIFT gpi was what treasurers thought would have the biggest impact on the industry in the coming years. It shows that education and providing information to treasurers is going to be important as we look to progressively include them on this journey.” SWIFT gpi will be deployed step by step. Current schemes will continue to coexist with the new SWIFT gpi. This is not a revolution, nor a big bang but rather a smooth and steady transformation of the correspondent banking business with a new standard progressively settling in. But then, even Rome was not built in a day.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Financial institutions today are feeling increasingly under pressure, trying to deal with multiple regulations and financial crime compliance obligations while needing to ensure that their technology and operations are optimised for efficiency. This leaves little remaining budget for innovation, and yet without innovating, firms will lose out to new, faster entrants that are riding the wave of the new consumer demand for near real-time, transparent and seamless applications.</p>
<p>In this rapidly evolving environment, corporate customers require more from their cross-border payments experience. Today, when a corporate treasurer sends a request for a cross-border transaction to his bank, he typically has no sight on what actually happens with that demand, often creating a source of potential discussion and frustration between seller and supplier with respect to effective payment reception and related costs.</p>
<p>Recognising this situation, SWIFT has united nearly 60 of the world’s largest transaction banks to work on an innovative solution – the global payments innovation initiative.</p>
<p>The initiative will allow corporate treasurers to benefit from the same day use of funds, track payments from start to finish in real time, have full transparency of fees, as well as significantly improving reconciliation between payments and invoices through richer and unaltered payment information. All using the same platform they have in place today, allowing them to grow their international business, improve supplier relationships, and achieve greater treasury efficiencies.</p>
<p>The banks involved in the initiative have already agreed on a first service level agreement (SLA) that will enable corporates to enjoy cross-border payments with greater speed, transparency and predictability – a service that is being piloted this year and will go live in 2017.</p>
<p>In the longer term, the initiative is building a vision for the future of cross-border payments in conjunction with its member banks. As part of this, SWIFT is devoting significant resources to instigate the opportunities and challenges of deploying blockchain, and distributed ledger technologies more broadly, on our platform. While the initiative aims to first make improvements based on the existing infrastructures, in parallel, we are also building a roadmap on the adoption of new technologies in order to ensure corporate customers receive the best possible payments experience in the near future.</p>
<p>Innovation is not only about creating a revolutionary new technology or business process, it is also about driving adoption to make real world change. SWIFT is ideally placed to support the community in working more effectively together to find common solutions that meet business expectations and satisfy regulatory realities.</p></div>

<p>For decades, the way in which cross-border payments are made has barely changed, yet over recent years, there has been a wave of innovations across the payments landscape. We see three key drivers: globalisation, changing user needs and increased competition.</p>
<p>Globalisation is boosting the number of consumers with buying power. This increases global commerce and therefore cross-border payments, which in turn creates a demand for faster, less expensive and more reliable cross-currency payment options. Between 2010 and 2013, annual cross-border payments increased by 14%; yet between 2008 and 2013, the average value of cross border payments dropped by 25%<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, this is a trend we expect to continue.</p>
<p>User needs are changing, particularly amongst the millennial generation, who, it is predicted, will comprise 75% of the global workforce by 2025. This generation has grown up with mobile devices and a willingness to try new technologies. They are also an ‘immediate’ group, demanding that things be arranged instantly and at a reasonable cost. This is directly driving the adoption of new technologies such as blockchain and creating a demand for greater transparency of cross-border payments.</p>
<p>Lastly, the rise of fintechs has led to increased competition in the payments space, and today we see banks under pressure to invest in new technologies and partner in innovative ways to remain competitive. Yet while technology is developing faster today than at any time in history, we’re still not seeing rapid adoption by the corporate world, despite the many benefits, including those listed below, on offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As payments continue to migrate to instant schemes, corporates gain more flexibility and better optimisation of their working capital.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Payments which currently go from bank account to bank account, will be able to use e- or mobile wallets, and this creates further opportunities to reach new customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New payment mechanisms such as blockchain and XML have the ability to carry more data which will improve reconciliation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With today’s rapid pace of technological change, none of this is far away – but to get there, much work still has to be done by the wider industry to ensure that the changing needs of corporate treasury can be achieved. That is where most of the conversation is now taking place. There’s no doubt that we are in exciting times, and one thing is certain – the next five years will bring with it more capabilities than we have seen in the past decade.</p>

<p>From SEPA Instant Payments to the potential benefits of blockchain technology, today’s payments landscape is arguably more dynamic than ever before. Many of these developments will have direct relevance for corporate treasurers.</p>
<p>In terms of the drivers, regulation is a key force behind innovation, not least in Europe. Take the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2), for example. Although it is still a work in progress, PSD2 could potentially enable all of a corporate’s bank accounts to be linked up via an application programming interface (API). For treasurers, this could mean being able to easily see a complete picture of the company’s cash positions in one place, which could significantly reduce the operational challenges of being multi-banked.</p>
<p>Another example of regulation driving innovation is the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer Scheme (SCT Inst), which stands to introduce real-time payments across Europe. Whereas SEPA Credit Transfers (SCTs) are currently processed in batches, SCT Inst will be processed at a transaction level, and funds will be available in the beneficiary’s account within ten seconds. SCT Inst will go live in November 2017, with an initial value limit of €15,000, and treasurers will be able to process payments 24/7, 365 days a year.</p>
<p>Alongside innovation, the payments industry is also experiencing enormous disruption. The barriers to entry have been lowered by regulatory initiatives (including PSD2) aimed at increasing competition in the sector. This has made room for non-bank entrants, such as established technology vendors, mobile phone companies and fintech start-ups. While this is both an opportunity and a challenge for incumbent banks, greater competition should ultimately result in cheaper, faster and more efficient payments – which can only be good news for treasurers.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this disruption is also driving greater collaboration within the banking industry. A good example of this is the R3 consortium of over 40 leading financial institutions, including ING, which calls for members to work together to unlock the potential of blockchain technology. Within the payments sector, blockchain could significantly enhance transparency, efficiency, speed of settlement, trust and security, as well as reducing costs. And although blockchain remains at the ‘proof of concept’ stage, it is certainly a development for treasurers to watch closely.</p>
<p>It is also worth remembering that many payments innovations will have an impact on collections. This is not just a question of upgrading point of sale (POS) terminals to accept mobile payments. Real-time payments, for instance, mean that companies must be prepared to recognise incoming payments at any time, any day of the week. As a result, treasurers will need to consider how to improve their collections processes in line with payments innovations, with the aim of achieving 100% straight through reconciliation.</p>
<p>The good news is that banks are helping treasurers respond to this need through product innovation. Virtual bank accounts (VBAs), for example, are proving to be an increasingly popular tool among treasurers looking for more streamlined and efficient collections.</p>
<p>Leveraging digital advances, virtual cash management (VCM) solutions enable treasurers to rationalise bank accounts, centralise multi-entity cash, and improve cash visibility. It also facilitates the set-up of ‘on behalf of’ structures –another important development in both the payments and collections spheres – which offer treasurers the possibility to reap significant efficiency gains.</p>
<p>In summary, innovation in the world of payments is being driven by a confluence of regulatory, digital and disruptive forces. And while there are exciting developments such as blockchain in the pipeline, there are also many innovations and solutions, like payments on behalf of (POBO), that treasurers can take advantage of today.</p></div>

<p>While much of the payment innovation hitting the headlines largely focuses on intermediating consumer flows and transforming end user experience, corporate treasurers face a balancing act to capitalise on the opportunities arising from the changing landscape and emerging technologies, whilst managing counterparty risk, productivity and scalability.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>New commerce and trading models</strong> – The exponential growth in e-commerce requires digitally native and traditional companies alike to scale up rapidly to access new customers in new markets and support payments and collections in more currencies and in more countries. Consequently, treasurers need to assess their cash management models (account structures, collection instruments etc.) and their robustness to continually deliver on the business’ growth agenda and effectively manage changes in the organisation’s FX risk profile.</p>
<p>Procurement practices are evolving with the uptake in dynamic discounting platforms providing opportunities to optimise supplier financing programs, creating new avenues for corporates to effectively deploy excess liquidity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Payments – faster, simpler, interconnected</strong> – The advent of real-time payments is enabling treasurers to make greater use of cash balances and accelerate cash conversion cycles with just-in-time payments.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as banks and fintechs explore the potential of blockchain and other distributed ledger protocols to enhance payments, trade and other financial services, there will be downstream benefits for corporate treasurers to manage payments and exchange currencies more efficiently and cost effectively over traditional banking models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Smarter data, smarter decisions</strong> – As payment offerings become increasingly standardised, treasurers have realised that, just as critical as the payment itself, is the data that accompanies these flows. Innovations in data management and API tools are allowing treasurers to effectively accept, consume and interpret data about their cash and working capital flows. This drives treasury efficiency, smarter decision making and creates deeper and more insightful analytics that have a direct positive impact on the business.</p>
<p>PSD2 and the advent of API-enabled controlled access to accounts by third-party service providers can improve visibility of liquidity positions and cash exposures and better leverage data to drive effective liquidity deployment and cash forecasting.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the internet of things (IoT) has increasing potential to connect and revolutionise supply and distribution ecosystems which, in turn, should enable more effective working capital allocation globally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Optimise liquidity, mobilise working capital</strong> – Industry initiatives and regulations such as SEPA, combined with the market adoption of ISO XML 20022, are enabling treasurers to further centralise treasury and operating models, mobilise working capital and create the business case for in-house bank (IHB) type structures as a natural evolution towards enhanced liquidity and risk management – combining centralisation of funding, liquidity, settlement and payment processes. The advent of virtual account ledgers and pay or receive on behalf of models is enabling the centralisation of liquidity with intercompany liquidity being managed internally within the IHB.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Managing payment risk and digital security</strong> – As the rapid pace of digitisation continues and the volume of online payments continues to increase, corporates find themselves exposed to a changing risk profile where cyber security and fraud prevention is now high on the corporate treasury agenda. To implement effective programs, treasurers must address the full spectrum of internal training, communication and leveraging emerging fraud prevention technology.</p>

<p>On the retail side, an all-out war on cash has been declared as the payments industry witnesses the traditional wallet being replaced by the mobile device. The financial services industry is now focusing on getting digital wallet share driven by app usage and integrated client experience. The ease, speed, and convenience of consumer electronic payments is driving the change for similar experiences across all payment and transaction infrastructures, including treasury. In fact, the ease of use on the retail side is highlighting the inefficiencies and stagnation that have been accepted for decades in the corporate payment space. And as corporate practitioners grow accustomed to easy and fast payments in their personal lives, they demand the same in the workplace.</p>
<p>From the business perspective, corporate treasurers are managing the day-to-day tasks of the department, and it can be a ‘multi-portal’ experience to get the job done. They typically aren’t as concerned about innovation as with being able to get the job done as quickly and efficiently as possible. When a corporate treasurer handles the full payments lifecycle, including reconciliation, the payment process becomes much more complicated compared to what the average consumer experiences with the digital wallet.</p>
<p>But innovation on the corporate treasury side is starting to address the needs and demands of corporate treasurers. With the ubiquity of digital transactions, treasurers have to have the proper mechanisms in place to account for and manage added volume and various types of transactions. In the last few years, we have gone from ACH, cheque, and cash, to fully integrating card and digital payments into the mix. At the same time, the security mechanisms need to be in place to validate the transactions and integrate them into the corporate’s treasury management system. Cross-border payments are an increasing reality for corporate treasurers, and they need the best mechanisms with which to cross those borders.</p>
<p>Financial institutions are struggling to keep up with corporate treasurers’ increasing and rapidly evolving needs. Banks face competition from new market entrants, and revenues for banks are decreasing as the cost of payments transactions goes down. Smaller merchants and even consumers can now accept payments and not incur the hefty costs associated with merchant terminals. Market behaviours are breaking down the traditional silos and lines of business in financial institutions. To succeed in the new era of corporate treasury, financial institutions will need to achieve transparency from consumer-initiated payments to integrated reconcilement on the corporate’s books with ease, security, and accuracy. The appetite for corporates to take on a large-scale migration to a new treasury management system is waning. Corporates are looking for the same aggregated user experience consumers are receiving with the same ease of implementation and use consumers get from cloud-based applications.</p>
<p>More than ever, it will be true that banks should look to their retail customers’ demands to know what trends lay ahead for corporates. As millennials begin taking on senior roles within corporates, the demand for leading-edge payments technology will be expected.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>The impact that technology has made on our lives is truly profound. Many of us now walk around with at least one, perhaps even more, supercomputers in our pockets that enable us to access a universe of information that 20 years ago we could only have imagined. This has enabled us to perform many tasks, in near real time, making instant gratification the norm, not a privilege. Yet, despite this, there are some areas which have struggled to keep up, and as superior technology becomes more widely available and we are able to do more instantly and easily, the limitations of these become ever more apparent.</p>
<p>In the financial space, the most obvious example is payments. In most countries the domestic payments infrastructure is well-established, reliable and entrenched in the domestic financial system. Yet despite this, they are now beginning to show their age, as consumers and business demand access to faster, more agile systems. The financial institutions who offer these are held hostage to the functionality of the payments infrastructure and their own legacy systems, which prevent them innovating and offering services to meet evolving customer demands.</p>
<p>There are steps being taken to change this, however, and a number of forward-thinking countries have renewed their payments infrastructure and built best-in-class real-time systems which not only facilitate faster payments but also a broader revolution in payments for both corporates and consumers.</p>
<h3 id="a-diverse-landscape">A diverse landscape</h3>
<p>Today, Asia Pacific (APAC) is a region at the forefront of payments innovation. India, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Japan all have a form of real-time payments infrastructure – Japan’s Zengin system was actually the world’s first, although compared to modern standards it lags behind. There are also projects in development or being planned in Australia, Hong Kong and New Zealand.</p>
<p>But, for the most part, these examples are in developed Asia and as we covered in our last edition, the payments landscape in emerging Asia is very different. In these countries, which remain heavily reliant on cash, the financial infrastructure is dominated by traditional real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems and ACH – there is limited domestic real-time infrastructure.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, market realities, primarily the wide usage of mobile devices in these countries, has caused a number of parties, including the regulators, to bolster their payments infrastructure. The aim is to develop systems that match the increasingly digital nature of these economies and to drive further financial inclusion by making them more accessible. In Thailand for instance, there is a progressive agenda and a deep desire to move away from a cash-based society. To do this the regulators understand that they have to broaden access to electronic payments and remove the friction around these. As a result, they are closely watching a number of projects across the region to see how best to modernise their system. This is also the case in Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam.</p>
<h3 id="setting-the-standard">Setting the standard</h3>
<p>What comprises a modern real-time payments system and how do they differ from legacy systems? The clue is in the name. Real-time systems are designed to provide (nearly) instant value transfer, primarily aimed at low value, high-volume retail payments. Their most important function is therefore speed, and most real-time payments systems have been designed to ensure that payments are completed within 15 seconds and without the fear of returns or charge backs. This is achieved because payments are not batched together and settled at various points throughout the day – as is the case with ACH systems. Of equal importance is availability. Modern payments systems need to reflect a society which is always plugged in and be available 24/7, 365 days a year, offering society unlimited flexibility. This is unlike legacy ACH and RTGS systems which typically close overnight and at weekends.</p>
<p>There are obvious benefits for corporates here should they wish to use these financial rails. “If payments can be made instantly, no matter the size, this provides a fantastic opportunity to better plan their payments,” says George Evers, Head of International Product Development, Immediate Payments at VocaLink. “This in turn will allow them to drive better liquidity management and reduce float.” The constant availability of the systems also means there can be less friction caused by time zones when making cross-border payments.</p>
<p>Aside from their speed and availability, real-time payments systems also offer added benefits around data. Legacy payments systems, while stable, are often constrained by the limited amount of data that can be passed around the network. New systems have looked to solve this problem by leveraging SWIFT’s ISO 20022 messaging standard, which allows for a much richer data set to be included in the payment file. ISO 20022 is based on 16 bit double bytes, which allows 65,536 characters, both roman and non-roman, to be included making it particularly useful in Asia where non-roman characters are widely used.</p>
<p>For a corporate, there are obvious advantages that come with more information being included in the payment files. As Carlos Palmers, Head of RT Market Infrastructures at SWIFT explains: “Reconciliation is a major challenge for corporates and a large part of this challenge comes from receiving payments which contain little to no information about what they are for. The ISO standard however, allows corporates now to include this data by including the invoice data in the payment file. We are seeing corporates leverage this opportunity by linking their payments application with their logistic chain, driving straight through reconciliation through their payments processes.”</p>
<p>An additional benefit of using ISO 20022 is that it uses extensible markup language (XML), an open standard in which rules are defined that allow for messages and documents to be encoded in a consistent manner. In theory, this should bring consistency to payment infrastructures around the world. Yet, it seems that currently this benefit is not being realised as countries and banks are offering slightly different versions of the ‘standard’.</p>
<p>There is lots of work being done, however, by numerous working groups who are looking to ensure a consistent standard is used globally. But, with numerous countries developing, or planning new systems, time may be running out. According to Gene Neyer, Global Product Manager at Fundtech the corporate community is acutely aware of this challenge and, in many cases, has lost patience. “Corporates I speak to tell me that they don’t care what standard is picked, just as long as it’s consistent globally, giving them the ability to streamline and simplify their payments processes.”</p>
<h3 id="the-market-leader">The market leader</h3>
<p>A country which is setting the standard in regard to faster payments is Singapore, which in March 2014 launched its Fast and Secure Transfers (FAST) platform. FAST replaces the legacy eGiro payment system that dates back to the 1980s, and enables customers of (currently) 14 participating banks to offer real-time credit transfers and direct debit facilities. “This is the most modern and advanced payments infrastructure in the world today,” says VocaLink’s Evers, “and can provide a blueprint for systems globally.”</p>
<p>The initial phase of the scheme – real-time payments – came into effect on 17<sup>th</sup> March last year. Phase two, which involves bulk payments (G3 Bulk), is scheduled for Q4. The final piece of the jigsaw, an electronic direct debit authorisation (EDDA) system was expected to be rolled out in late 2015.</p>
<p>The direct debit authorisations will be set up and exchanged electronically, leveraging the scheme infrastructure and capabilities to support the adoption of a bulk payment and will benefit real-time debit transactions. It will reduce the turnaround time required to set up an authorisation from the existing 12 to 15 working days to five working days or less, depending on the readiness of billing organisations’ banks and the billing organisations themselves. Amendments and termination features will be included as part of the module.</p>
<p>Despite phase one only recently being completed, the market in Singapore is already beginning to realise the benefits. As Evers explains: “Since the launch, the participating banks have been competing and innovating in order to deliver best-in-class solutions to their customers. This has happened because the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) demanded that all banks be ready on day one to ensure that the entire market could benefit and not just the customers of one or two banks.”</p>
<p>It must be noted, that for the most part, FAST has initially been aimed at the retail market. A maximum value transfer limit of SGD 10,000 was put in place during the formative months of the project to help it bed in. Naturally, this limited its use for corporates, but in recent months an increasing demand from the corporate community has seen the MAS raise payment limit from SGD 10,000 to SGD 50,000 providing more of an opportunity for corporates to use the service. According to Evers the challenge now will be how quickly the banks can innovate to offer the opportunity to utilise FAST to treasurers.</p>
<h3 id="the-up-and-comer">The up and comer</h3>
<p>Work is also currently underway in Australia to build the New Payments Platform (NPP) which is set to modernise the country’s payments system, which to date has been based on bilateral clearing arrangements. The system will offer all of the benefits that we have come to expect from a modern infrastructure providing businesses and consumers with a fast, versatile, data-rich payments system for making everyday transactions. In contrast to Singapore however, there will be no upper limit for payment amounts, giving corporates the opportunity to access the system from day one to make immediate high-value payments. This, of course, depends on the banks’ ability to make this available to their corporate customers.</p>
<p>For SWIFT’s Palmers the approach Australia is taking is very innovative. “It is being built in such a way that allows for innovation to easily occur from banks and other third-party financial service providers. For instance, we have already seen examples of how it can be easily implemented into e-commerce platforms, facilitate mobile-to-mobile payments and also how notary services can be included in the payment files making it easier and quicker to process real estate transactions.”</p>
<p>SWIFT are building the underlying platform in Australia and a total of 17 institutions are taking part in the programme, including Australia’s ‘big four’ banks: ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank and Westpac. Foreign institutions such as Citi, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, ING and HSBC are also heavily involved. It is expected that the NPP will go live in 2017.</p>
<h3 id="a-regional-approach">A regional approach</h3>
<p>The NPP, just like FAST in Singapore, is a domestic project, built to process domestic transactions in local currency. Yet, given the global nature of business and the increasingly global nature of e and m-commerce, could a regional infrastructure drive greater benefit?</p>
<p>According to David Brown, Senior Vice President, Payments and Products and Australia Country Manager at Fundtech there is a benefit and some countries have outlined a clear agenda to offer regional capabilities. “Singapore for instance indicated from day one that they wanted to eventually allow foreign currency transactions to occur within Singapore in real-time. They also indicated that once the infrastructure is stable and fully embedded domestically they wish to use it to facilitate cross-border payments across the ASEAN region and to connect the various clearing houses. These developments are definitely on the horizon although there are still challenges that need to be worked through such as the currency conversion, and how transactions will take place.”</p>
<p>SWIFT’s Palmers paints a similar picture for Australia’s NPP. “The platform is domestic in nature and all the participating banks were asked to have their infrastructure in Australia. But, a number of banks, particularly those with a strong regional presence, are already considering payments instructions from overseas in AUD and then inputting these into the NPP as a way to speed up the process of cross-border AUD payments.”</p>
<p>The technology is therefore in place to facilitate these cross-border flows but there is a regulatory hurdle. “The national payments infrastructure is a vital cog in any country’s domestic economy and overall community,” says VocaLink’s Evers. “Consequently, for countries to give away some degree of control of these to their regional neighbours may be a hard sell.”</p>
<h3 id="future-rails">Future rails</h3>
<p>A solution may potentially come from a system that is independent of governments and one that transcends borders – the blockchain. There has been a lot of development in this space in recent months, including a number of high-profile banks experimenting with the technology, and recently signing up to the R3 consortium. But, its real potential may be in being the glue that connects all domestic payments infrastructure together. This is one of the ambitions of Ripple, a company advertised as the world’s first open-standard, Internet Protocol (IP)-based technology for banks to clear and settle transactions in real time via a distributed network. It is Ripple’s view that their technology can not only connect these systems together but also allow for cross-border transactions to happen in real-time and at a reduced cost compared to today.</p>
<p>Fundtech’s Neyer, however, suggests caution around these solutions. “While these may have shown some success, the sample size is a tiny fraction of all cross-border payments. Whether these systems have the ability to scale up to that size and handle millions, if not billions of transactions is a big question.” According to Neyer, blockchain platforms are also currently limited in their use for corporates. “The data that can be included along with the payment is currently extremely limited (similar to legacy domestic systems). This will of course create the same issues many corporates are experiencing now regarding reconciliation. It will also limit their compatibility with modern domestic payments infrastructure that can accept lots of data.” Ripple have confirmed however that they are working to ensure that more data can be included in the payment file in the future potentially alleviating this issue.</p>
<p>Yet, despite these current limitations, Neyer sees these platforms having a broader impact. “Currently the banking industry hasn’t seen these platforms as a threat and instead has partnered with them to see how they can leverage the benefits they offer. It will be interesting to see if one of these Fintech companies makes a significant breakthrough and the dynamic shifts, making them a threat to banks, their business models and profitability.”</p>
<p>If this happens Neyer believes that banks would make significant changes to their business model, including lowering their costs and speeding up their processes. “One of the biggest impacts these Fintech companies can have is to succeed in what they are doing and force banks to make banking more efficient by putting pressure on their business models.”</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>Previously seen as a necessity for travel and entertainment purposes at large organisations, corporate cards have evolved into an entirely different and powerful tool that can drive visibility and control across corporate spending. Offering the possibility of streamlined cash management processes and improved working capital efficiency, corporate cards are becoming increasingly popular among the broader treasury community – not just the big companies.</em></p>
<p>When asked about significant shifts in the profile of corporate card users over the last 12 months, Brendan Walsh, Executive Vice President, American Express Global Corporate Payments, says the mid-market sector (companies with revenues of between $3m and $300m) is growing fast and that these enterprises are using cards for both travel and entertainment and business-to-business expenses.</p>
<h3 id="geographic-trends">Geographic trends</h3>
<p>“In slow growth economies, companies have a higher propensity to use their corporate cards for non-travel and entertainment spend. The working capital advantage from usage of corporate cards is key and not just for the cash flow benefit from spending now and paying later – in fact, companies are using their corporate payment products to facilitate payments between a company and its suppliers.” In this scenario, companies still benefit from extended payment terms and suppliers get paid much more quickly than they would have by invoice.</p>
<p>In economies with slow growth, many large clients are also reducing their travel, notes Walsh. “But in markets where growth is buoyant or international trade is burgeoning, travel volumes among companies of all sizes are increasing once again, although clearly this trend differs according to proximity to trading partners.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere, companies in developed economies are looking to capture more cross-border transactions on plastic rather than invoice, he adds, observing that corporates are making more business-to-business and international payments by card. “This is a huge growth area and business-to-business volumes are increasing every year.”</p>
<p>ING’s Global Head of Card Solutions, Erik Tak, agrees that use of corporate cards for travel and entertainment is expanding as business travel recovers from the recession. “In addition, more companies are looking to improve the management of their expense reimbursement process and deploy automated expense management systems that are most effective when used in conjunction with a corporate card programme to increase process efficiency and achieve cost reductions,” he says.</p>
<h3 id="tailored-to-the-market">Tailored to the market</h3>
<p>Nevertheless, commercial card programmes differ greatly around the world (corporate, purchasing, fleet and payable solutions) so trends will vary by geography, observes Tad Fordyce, Senior Vice President, Head of Global Commercial Solutions at Visa.</p>
<p>“For developed markets, we have a wide variety of commercial solutions, while in emerging markets the most commonly found product is the traditional corporate card. In terms of trends, we have seen two main ones. The first is that we are beginning to see more middle market companies adopt these payment tools in North America. Traditionally our products were adopted by large corporations, but as this market reaches high levels of penetration, financial institutions are turning their attention towards middle market corporations.</p>
<p>“The second trend is the emergence of payables solutions, where virtual accounts are embedded in the accounts payable software, so invoices can be paid by card in a similar fashion to how they can currently be paid by ACH, cheque and wire.”</p>
<p>He says increased volumes of business-to-business and international payments made by card can be identified in two ways. “We continue to see corporate cards being used for international travel. As payables solutions proliferate, companies are also using their virtual account numbers for procuring goods and services overseas and driving more cross-border transactions.”</p>
<p>Martin Chapman, Travel &amp; Entertainment Payment Solutions Manager at MasterCard shares the view that corporates are making more business-to-business and international payments by card. “As businesses come to realise that traditional methods of invoicing are slow and time consuming for their employees, they are shifting transactions onto purchasing cards and corporate card-based purchasing.”</p>
<h3 id="safety-in-numbers">Safety in numbers</h3>
<p>Security is a vital consideration when companies are considering a shift to cards. So is identity theft a major issue for corporate card users and suppliers and have anti-fraud technologies kept pace with the efforts of fraudsters? “Chip and pin on corporate cards is minimising fraud, in addition to card issuers’ own security practices, which can easily detect out-of-pattern expenditure,” says Walsh.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tak states that while identity theft has not been a significant issue in the corporate card space, fraud is an ever present threat and corporate card issuers have made significant investments in recent years in the protection, prevention and detection of card based fraud. “For example, we have introduced three key tools in the last 12 months that assist in containing fraud. These include the deployment of a new system that moves the authentication of ecommerce transactions from a static password that was easily forgotten to a more secure, one time password that is sent to cardholder via SMS on their mobile phone.</p>
<p>“Another SMS-based service is a security alert service that contacts cardholders when our systems detect a possible fraudulent transaction. Lastly, by offering a mobile app to our cardholders, they are able to see their recent transactions in almost real-time, thereby making the detection of fraud much faster.”</p>
<p>Chapman says EMV chips are taking the fight to the next level, while the industry works on future technologies such as biometric authentication. “Identity fraud is an issue for the card industry, but less so for corporate cards. As corporate schemes predominantly service digitally (removing paper lowers cost), use secure file storage and apply greater internal controls, the opportunities for fraudsters to access and apply for credit using an employee’s identity are reduced.”</p>
<p>Fordyce refers to anti-fraud technologies as a three-legged stool. For card present transactions, the rollout of EMV in the US market later this year will also apply to commercial card products, giving corporate users the same level of security as consumer cards. For ‘card not present’ transactions Visa is rolling out tokenisation, which replaces sensitive payment data with a unique identifier or token that is useless if compromised. The third leg of the stool focuses on encrypting data at rest. When the company talks to suppliers and merchants, banks and processors, it shares best practices to make sure data is encrypted, protecting it from fraudsters.</p>
<h3 id="value-of-integration">Value of integration</h3>
<p>Besides security, proper integration is another tough challenge when it comes to cards. Louis Berard, a Senior Analyst at Aberdeen Group and author of a report on corporate cards published in October 2014 says lower mid-market organisations that leverage an expense management solution with corporate card integration achieve an 18% decrease in processing costs of expense reports, a 22% decrease in overall reimbursement timeframe and 84% fewer reimbursement errors.</p>
<p>His view is that companies that leverage expense management with corporate card integration benefit from greater visibility into business travel data and increased compliance with corporate travel policies. Integrating a corporate card and expense management system also presents the expense processing department with a more holistic view of the information.</p>
<p>There is a formal process designed for expense reports that clearly defines escalation paths and with this greater visibility, sourcing teams can capture spend and negotiate better contracts. While audits allow for the system to remain in ‘balance’, they also provide a greater opportunity to find new areas for cost saving or losses that may be occurring through leakage.</p>
<p>Berard recommends that organisations in the lower mid-market sector should strategically enhance their expense management programmes to spur performance across the scope of compliance, time (approval and reimbursements) and processing costs.</p>
<p>To effectively manage expenses, it is crucial for organisations in this sector to leverage the following recommended actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Look to corporate card and expense management integration as a means of improving existing expense management processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conduct regular audits of expense reports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhance visibility into expense spend through automation and corporate card/expense management integration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="remaining-challenges">Remaining challenges</h3>
<p>One challenge that still requires some work where procurement card programmes are concerned, however, is supplier enablement. “Although the landscape is changing and suppliers increasingly value the benefits of guaranteed payment and speedy payment (within a couple of days), buyers are looking for ubiquitous supplier acceptance of cards and that is still work in progress for the commercial cards community,” says Tak.</p>
<p>For Walsh, the area that really needs more focus is implementing a true end-to-end solution to drive visibility, compliance and savings that can be achieved through best in class practice, he continues. “In most cases, by moving to best practice expense management companies can save 10% of their total processing and purchasing costs. These funds can then be reinvested to drive growth.”</p>
<p>Chapman, however, describes the challenges in using corporate cards as part of strategic procurement programmes as being around educating corporates about the benefits of using purchasing cards, which provide greater control, acceptance and flexibility resulting in detailed reporting and more efficiency in the supply chain process. “Outlining to businesses the benefits of making an investment in automating accounts payable systems (end-to-end) and moving away from traditional procurement processes to more efficient processes is the challenge.”</p>
<h3 id="further-growth-expected">Further growth expected</h3>
<p>Whatever the challenges though, Walsh says there is potential for future growth in cards across just about every market. “We see major potential for further use of corporate cards across the globe, from developing to developed markets. To put this into context, about $25 trillion is currently spent in cash and cheques which do not offer the visibility, compliance or data insights that corporates need. By comparison, $6 trillion is spent on cards.”</p>
<p>Tak agrees that corporate cards are a growing business in all regions, even in the mature US market where epayables solutions are driving transactions from cheque to card. “Within Europe, the trend is for large corporates and multinationals to consolidate fragmented card solutions from multiple providers as a way of driving more consistency, efficiency and cost effectiveness into their businesses.”</p>
<p>In Chapman’s view, markets such as Eastern Europe (Poland, Hungary), Turkey and Asia Pacific show the greatest potential for growth, albeit from a low base. “In developed markets such as western Europe, although growth percentages are small, the opportunity to grow the volumes of cards is still significant.”</p>
<p>Whereas Fordyce describes the emerging economies of Asia and Latin America as offering tremendous growth opportunities as they become more developed. “In general, our growth rate follows where we see the greatest economic growth,” he concludes. “Wherever you see robust economic growth, the corporations driving that growth are adopting card products to help control expenses.”</p>

<h2>Case study</h2>
<br/>
<img alt="EDF Energy" class="logo org" height="64" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/edf-energy-logo-2015-40x64.png" width="40">
<br/>
<p>One company that has used its card provider to simplify its travel expense management system is EDF Energy, which has an annual travel spend of approximately £15m. The company’s previous system, which enabled its 15,000 employees to book travel, was growing increasingly complex and fragmented because it was based on a central booking and lodge card payment system for air travel. There was no single view of travel spend across the company, which experienced inconsistent application of travel policy. There was also the potential for unauthorised spending.</p>
<p>In addition, the system was not designed to accommodate low-cost air carriers, which encouraged users away from the self-booking tool, leading to an inefficient and expensive reconciliation process. EDF Energy wanted to consolidate and streamline payments into one centrally settled solution. To allow greater management visibility, it also needed payment data to flow seamlessly in to a standard expense reporting system.</p>
<p>To achieve this, the company decided to implement a solution from American Express that makes use of virtual accounts, with each traveller having an account lodged behind their profile in the company’s online booking tool. This is synchronised with the traveller’s profile held on the travel management company’s online booking system. “We are now able to deliver a vast amount of account numbers unique to individual employees to our online booking tool in a very painless and efficient manner,” says EDF Energy’s Financial Shared Services Director, Robert Gilhooly.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>In the search for growth, corporates continue to expand their operations across the globe. This is not limited to Western companies looking to Asia and Africa; emerging markets companies are also spreading their wings towards the developed markets. The potential benefits and opportunities in each market may differ, but the overall globalisation challenge is the same: any corporate expanding its global footprint must do so in a streamlined manner, whilst remaining connected to their end markets. Otherwise, they risk top line gains being eroded by process and structural inefficiencies.</p>
<p>“For corporate treasurers, this means embracing centralisation and rationalisation to ensure an optimal payments and receivables global set-up,” says Ireti Samuel-Ogbu, EMEA Head of Payments and Receivables, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi. The first step on this centralisation and rationalisation journey, she says, should be the establishment of a shared service centre (SSC) – something which is not new, but is most definitely evolving.</p>
<h3 id="the-new-shared-services-model">The new shared services model</h3>
<p>“But don’t be fooled into thinking that this is a ‘lift and shift’ exercise of yesteryear,” notes John Murray, EMEA Head of Corporate and Public Sector Cash Sales, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi. “As corporates get smarter about cutting costs, delivering value and reducing risks against a backdrop of geopolitical and market uncertainty, they are putting a lot of time and energy into deriving financial and control benefits through optimising their SSCs.”</p>
<p>Take the example of Mondelēz International, one of the world’s largest snacks companies, which streamlined its treasury and business services to release resources within its European Business Services Centre (EBSC) to focus on more value-adding tasks. The EBSC faced challenges in working with multiple banking providers and using multiple electronic banking channels. These arrangements were complex, leading to high levels of banking fees and resource-intensive supporting functions and limiting the ability to take advantage of improved banking technologies.</p>
<p>With the help of Citi, the Mondelēz International treasury team embarked on an ambitious ‘One Bank’ project in order to bring simplicity, consistency and transparency to treasury operations – with the goal of rationalising the number of accounts it held and to reduce its overhead variable costs. In addition to collaborating with just one bank across the entire European region, the company also wanted to move to a bank-agnostic delivery channel and a single global file format, namely ISO XML.</p>
<p>“As the Mondelēz International case highlights, the greatest levels of optimisation and rationalisation are being achieved by those corporates prepared to go ‘under the hood’ of their SSC and really challenge the status quo,” says Hemant Gada, EMEA Head of Channel and Enterprise Services, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi.</p>
<h3 id="doing-it-in-house">Doing it in-house</h3>
<p>Taking this rationalisation drive one step further, in-house banks (IHBs) are also becoming increasingly popular among forward-thinking corporates. Rather than taking a payments factory approach (where each subsidiary retains its own bank account), the SSC model is evolving towards a very streamlined or even single account approach, thanks to the IHB.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, the in-house bank set-up lends itself very nicely to payments-on-behalf-of (POBO) and receivables-on-behalf-of (ROBO) structures, which can help an organisation move to the next stage of operational efficiency and risk management control,” adds Samuel-Ogbu.</p>
<p>The on-behalf-of (OBO) model offers numerous benefits. On the POBO side, the liabilities of each local business unit can be discharged out of liquidity owned centrally at the IHB (even though they remain on the balance sheet of the business unit). As a result, treasury can better design and deploy optimal liquidity structures. Meanwhile, the ROBO structure provides a significant incentive to improve straight through reconciliation rates, minimise errors, and provide a full audit trail from the IHB back to each subsidiary.</p>
<p>Leveraging the IHB set-up, it is also possible to simplify the management of foreign currency balances and transactions through the use of a multi-currency account. And as Samuel-Ogbu observes, “using a streamlined or single account set-up to process multi-currency payments – in up to 100 different currencies – can dramatically reduce FX administration and the associated costs.”</p>
<h3 id="increasing-control-reducing-risk">Increasing control, reducing risk</h3>
<p>Operating a centralised treasury with a streamlined payments and receivables structure also aids 360 degree cash visibility. “Right now, clients need real-time visibility over their flows from every perspective, including at a country level,” says Murray. “Take Russia and Ukraine, for example. Treasurers with operations there need to know they have sufficient funding in those markets to pay their local teams and meet local supplier payments. This is where having the single view over your balances, and working with the support of a knowledgeable banking partner that you trust, can help you to honour your obligations to your employees, and to the company from a working capital perspective,” he explains.</p>
<h3 id="embrace-digitisation">Embrace digitisation</h3>
<p>“The right technology can further improve visibility on all fronts – whether you’re trying to get money in or out of a country, or simply want real-time balance information,” says Gada. “In this respect, banks such as Citi are developing a range of new mobile and tablet tools which give treasurers greater transparency on their account information, together with analytics on-the-go. The resulting ‘snapshot’ enables them to take quick decisions on where cash is most important – globally – at any given moment.”</p>
<p>The analytics that Citi currently offers include balance information across accounts at the bank – and third-party bank accounts. The data can also be cut by currency and by country to monitor exposures in that way. And if a trapped liquidity concern does arise, then the client can easily act upon that data, or get in touch with their liquidity provider for support. “The true value of analytics lies in enabling treasurers to be better informed and to work smarter,” adds Gada.</p>
<p>“As an example of this ‘working smarter’ theme,” says Murray, “this kind of analytical data also assists greatly with benchmarking and achieving best practice in liquidity management. It allows clients to examine whether they might be able to invest their money more wisely; pay down debt; reduce risks; or see if there is any liquidity that they are not capturing, for instance. In short, it provides a catalyst for clients to think differently.”</p>
<h3 id="a-collaborative-future">A collaborative future</h3>
<p>Aside from analytics, the big transaction banks are also helping clients to embrace technologies which are perhaps less ‘exciting’ but equally fundamental to overcoming the globalisation challenge. For example, by leveraging cloud innovation and format standards such as XML, treasurers could not only reduce their IT costs but also implement a single core technology base that should improve transaction and information flows to and from their banks.</p>
<p>These flows include transparency around pricing data. “And this is where the XML comes into its own as it allows the bank to gather data from all of its global applications and present a coherent picture to the client that says precisely what we charge them for their transactions and what we collect from their subsidiaries,” Gada observes.</p>
<p>The underlying message here is that clients’ ecosystems and banks’ ecosystems no longer need be distinct. “Today, a treasury can leverage the bank’s ecosystem to help them get their job done – whether this be analysing bank fees, or even streamlining bank account management (BAM), through eBAM. A co-operative model, potentially with the bank embedded in the client’s ERP, has to be the way forward in terms of efficiency and productivity,” he adds.</p>
<p>This collaborative approach also rings true on the advisory side, with Murray keen to work alongside corporates to help them “explore other ways to digitise payments to suppliers, through commercial and virtual card solutions, for instance.” These might not be the traditional payment instruments treasurers are familiar with, he says, but corporates need to consider alternative methods in order to achieve an optimal payments and receivables set-up.</p>
<p>Samuel-Ogbu agrees, saying that: “Whether it be virtual accounts, multi-currency accounts, or POBO and ROBO structures, it is the responsibility of the treasurer – in conjunction with their banking partner(s) – to implement the best tools, processes and structures to optimise global payments and receivables.” Furthermore, as globalisation continues, geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties remain, and cost pressures increase, an intelligent approach to payments and receivables will no longer be ‘nice to have’, it will be essential.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body">
<p>Whether it is referred to as automated trading, black-box trading or algorithmic trading, the use of computers and mathematical formulae always makes trading more systematic because it takes the human emotional element out of trading activities. If this is a good thing or not is a moot point: since it arrived in the markets around 15 years ago, algo trading is a potential source of increased profit, an efficient risk management tool or a disaster waiting to happen depending on how it is used.</p>
<p>Those already familiar with this topic will perhaps already be thinking of the $440m loss (and near-collapse) in just 30 minutes of US market maker and broker, Knight Capital, caused by a bug in one of its high frequency trading (HFT) algorithms. HFT aims to achieve the lowest possible execution latency (the time that elapses from the moment a signal is sent to its receipt). More than 5000 orders a second can be sent to a trading venue with order and execution report round-trip times of around 100 microseconds (100 millionths of a second) now possible. A poorly tested system is a recipe for disaster.</p></div>

<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote>The formulae are complex, numerically intensive computations and algo trading systems use them to detect and subtly exploit market movements, according to certain pre-defined thresholds, allowing the trader to manage risk.</blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source"></p>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Many will certainly know of the most famous HFT ‘event’: the ‘flash crash’ of 2010 when the Dow Jones lost more than 1,000 points in a matter of minutes. Again, this was caused by a bug in a system which sent the whole market into freefall before someone literally pulled the plug on it. Given the interconnectivity of the global financial markets, events of this kind are a worry and cast a shadow over algo trading. But HFT is not algo trading – it is simply a strategy that uses an algorithm to trade.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-algo-trading">What is algo trading?</h3>
<p>Traditional trading is voice trading – picking up the phone and asking for a quote from a panel of banks and locking in a deal. Electronic trading on multi-bank or proprietary platforms does the same thing only (arguably) more efficiently. In each case, once the deal is agreed, the bank takes on the risk that arises in the time between agreeing the price and executing the transaction (the price continues to move as the bank searches for the liquidity to carry out that deal).</p>
<p>Because of the lack of trade anonymity this process carries, a major trade execution (of perhaps $500m upwards) is difficult to price as a single transaction will move the market against the buyer; the bank either has to factor that likely movement into the price or drip-feed the order into the market – but by placing the order over time it will still be subject to market movements (positive and negative) until the whole trade is complete. Either way, the bank takes the risk and the corporate will pay for the price lock-in, one way or another.</p>
<p>What’s needed is speed and stealth as a means of getting in and out of the market at the most appropriate point. This is where algorithmic execution comes into play. An algorithm is a mathematical formula for solving a problem. The formulae are complex, numerically intensive computations and algo trading systems use them to detect and subtly exploit market movements, according to certain pre-defined thresholds, allowing the trader to manage risk (or drive profits, depending on the algorithm) without creating any significant ‘noise’ that would alert the market and potentially affect price.</p>
<p>Builders of algo trading applications may use development platforms such as MatLab (offered by mathematical computing software developer, Mathworks) but some banks – BNP Paribas, for example (see overleaf) – have their own offerings. The algorithms used will typically be based around concepts such as ‘neural networking’ and ‘adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference’ which, in essence, allow the systems to learn on the job, adapting what they do according to initial parameters and the real-time movements in the markets (and all will now work across multiple venues).</p>
<h3 id="the-key-components-of-an-algo-trading-system">The key components of an algo trading system</h3>
<h5>Algorithms:</h5>
<p>These are required to perform correlation analysis, identify trading opportunities and determine optimal trading launch time. Parameters for the trades are set within the algorithms, such as time, quantity and price. Algorithms also measure the trade execution against benchmarks.</p>
<h5>Market data:</h5>
<p>Historic, intraday and real-time data is required for the system to analyse trends. This may be drawn from multiple sources including market data feeds and in-house spreadsheets.</p>
<h5>Order management:</h5>
<p>As well as predicting the optimal order, the system also manages and processes all the orders it makes.</p>
<h5>Connectivity:</h5>
<p>Algorithms should be connected to liquidity pools such as exchanges and inter-dealer brokers to further monitor market conditions.</p>
<h5>Integration:</h5>
<p>A system should be fully integrated with back office and trading systems to maximise efficiency and ensure compliance.</p>
<p>Most important of all is an understanding that the more complex the algorithm, the more stringent the back-testing and re-calibration should be. Development of an algorithm must be iterative in order for it to function in a dynamic market; adaptive technologies can do this on the fly.</p>
<h3 id="algo-trading-strategies">Algo trading strategies</h3>
<p>The dynamic nature of the markets means the process of defining a strategy (or strategies) for using an algo must also be iterative; test and refine are the watchwords. There are a number of trading strategies used in algo trading, each favouring a different outcome or scenario. The algos that fulfil these approaches tend to have descriptive names such as Stealth, Sniper and Guerilla.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>The simplest and most common strategies follow trends in moving averages, channel breakouts, price level movements and other related technical indicators. These strategies do not involve predictive analytics or price forecasting to trade but instead require a specified trend or market event to take place. Another useful strategy is time weighted average price (TWAP) which breaks a large order into smaller slices, feeding these into the market over a certain period so as not to cause any ‘noise’ that might influence the trading activity of others and thus price (known as ‘iceberging’). When it became possible to piece together those small trades to find out if a large market player is behind, stealth trading algos were created. Others approaches include the aforementioned HFT, as well as market sentiment, arbitrage and mean reversion models.</p>
<h3 id="who-uses-it-and-why">Who uses it and why?</h3>
<p>Algo trading is used in various forms of trading and investment by short-term traders and sell-side players such as market makers and speculators for whom speed is of the essence. Mid- to long-term investors and institutional buy-side firms (such as pension funds, mutual funds and insurance companies) who trade in large values can also play because the ‘slicing and dicing’ of a single deal (breaking a large value into multiple smaller values) allows them to enter the markets without negatively influencing prices. Systematic traders – those who follows trends or trade currency pairs, for example (including corporates) – may benefit from the efficiencies of automated trading and the liquidity-searching function of an algo.</p>
<p>Algo trading offers a number of potential benefits. With the right (well-tested) algorithm, trades can usually be executed at the best possible prices. An automated system may provide well-timed, immediate and accurate trade order placement, having made simultaneous automated checks on multiple market conditions. A system will also remove the possibility of human error and can provide the trader with anonymity if this should be desired (perhaps as a prelude to a major M&amp;A deal).</p>
<h3 id="the-downside">The downside</h3>
<p>There are well-understood technical risks for users (and for the market if things go that badly). For example, system failure, network connectivity errors, time-lags between trade orders and execution and the chaos that imperfect/poorly tested algorithms can cause. But there are operational disadvantages too. It means paying brokerage fees to banks, but more worryingly – for FX trades, for example – it can expose the trader to market swings during the execution period (whereas with the traditional models the bank takes the risk). Modern algos are increasingly able to slice up and massage deals into the markets (and it needs to be multiple markets) with minimal noise, speeding up and slowing down trades according to market movements, but the risk is still with the trader not the bank.</p>
<h3 id="is-it-really-for-treasurers">Is it really for treasurers?</h3>
<p>Despite potential benefits, algo trading is not something that has seen a great deal of corporate demand, quite possibly because of the reputation of HFT. Corporates will argue that they do not typically trade and bet against very small market movements; they hedge specific transactional requirements, and there are more appropriate approaches they can use because most do not run their treasury department as a profit centre.</p>
<p>Indeed, part of the treasurer’s role is to minimise the effects of adverse market changes on their core business; engaging in any kind of trading related to their underlying business exposures is either frowned upon or expressly forbidden by policy. As such, corporations typically do not trade, they hedge; even the minority of corporates that do run trading desks tend to operate within conservative boundaries. Algo trading’s reputation may be a sticking point in this case and in FX trading, unless very large deals are sought, the pricing advantages of algo trading are likely to be minimal anyway.</p>
<p>However, where large trades are required, BNP Paribas believes it has tapped into a new wave of interest with a “third generation” of algos that might answer the needs of the treasury community.</p>
<h3 id="anatomy-of-an-fx-algo">Anatomy of an FX algo</h3>
<p>Algos for the FX market arrived about seven years ago, introduced by Credit Suisse, which drew inspiration from its successful equities trading platform. The first generation systems that followed allowed traders to buy a certain value over a specific time. They did a reasonable job but also left a heavy footprint in the market; when an algo is ‘discovered’ it is open to manipulation by the HFT community. Around five years’ ago, generation two appeared, allowing slightly more random executions to try to avoid detection. These products also offered a mechanism to consume liquidity across the fragmented FX market, aggregating deals across the 30 or so liquidity venues that were available. For the earlier iterations at least, trades still left too much of a signature for the HFT players to spot and exploit.</p>
<p>On average, the second generation algos probably still outperformed voice and electronic trading in the FX space and more banks were entering the fray, offering a bewildering range of passive and active algos to try to meet their clients’ differing execution strategies. When sourcing the right product, three or four banks multiplied by five or six algorithms equated to client confusion. But even when knowledgably selecting an algorithm, the algo chosen would typically function in the same way regardless of what was happening in the market; an aggressive system remained aggressive even in a quiet market.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">

<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>With simplification of choice in mind, BNP Paribas’ Cortex iX FX algorithmic execution product is the “third generation” of algo system, says its creator, Asif Razaq, the bank’s Global Head of FX Algo Execution. It was launched two years ago with a choice of just two algorithms: Chameleon and Viper. Chameleon has a more leisurely approach to the market whereas Viper is aimed at traders that need a quick and aggressive execution. A third offering, Iguana, has since been introduced for those wanting to trade over a particular time frame.</p>
<h3 id="creature-features">Creature features</h3>
<p>In building Chameleon, Razaq has created a product that best suits clients that have time to work their order into the market, and which goes a long way to avoid detection. “No two Chameleon executions are the same,” he states. “As a random function of what the market is doing it becomes difficult for the high frequency traders to detect a pattern.”</p>
<p>Chameleon starts with the client’s strategy and proceeds by analysing multiple sources of market data which it uses to re-calibrate its execution strategy in real-time. The algorithm effectively dictates how each order will be executed so that when the markets move, Chameleon moves accordingly, speeding up or slowing down but always remaining in line with strategy. For traders that feel the market has reached a point where it will favour them if they move quickly, a ‘Rapid Fill’ button can temporarily put the algorithm into the more aggressive ‘Viper’ mode, to be switched off when the client chooses.</p>
<p>Indeed, Viper shares many of Chameleon’s functions but is geared to operate in a very tight time schedule (seconds as opposed to minutes). The third algorithm, Iguana, takes the flexibility of Chameleon but additionally allows clients to set a specific time-frame instead of letting the system dictate. “Our initial thought was to make this function an addition to Chameleon but the two algos serve two different needs,” explains Razaq. “We want to make it easier for our clients to understand by making our algos less parameter-heavy.”</p>
<h3 id="the-thinking">The thinking</h3>
<p>Rather than feeding orders into a ‘black box’ and waiting, Razaq says clients are able to control the execution strategies themselves. “We wanted to create a simple interface and also have a feedback loop where information is delivered while the algo is trading; if it sees something happening in the market it will relay that back to the client so they can change, slow down, speed up, pause or even end the execution.”</p>
<p>Bearing in mind that this form of trading is for large values only, in practice, the client will issue instructions to purchase a specific currency, driving the algorithm to slice up that deal, minimising market impact by reaching out across every venue. It will then aim for the best spread at the time. The caveat remains that whilst the system is executing, the user is taking on market risk. But, says Razaq, if the algorithm is good enough to capture a significant price improvement over the risk transfer price (the price attained via voice trading or normal electronic trading) then the user will gain overall on a major single trade.</p>
<p>A post-trade report is generated for the client, giving a real-time view of how the algo performed against various market scenarios. With a detailed breakdown of every execution and trade ticket, the system also provides an auditable record of all trading, especially useful for evidence of compliance with corporate ‘best execution’ policy.</p>
<h3 id="uptake">Uptake</h3>
<p>“We estimate that about 20% of the FX market is now trading via algo products,” says Razaq. “It is a growing space and the biggest growing client sector for adopting this technology is the corporate sector; they are looking for alternate ways to hedge and execute and there are now palatable products that they can use.” Typically corporates will be using an algo for an M&amp;A deal or a dividend payment or anything of significant size. BNP Paribas’ offerings purposefully allow client anonymity (even within the bank) by trading only under the bank’s name. This is important, explains Razaq, because a major corporate suddenly making a large volume of currency transactions could alert the market to an activity (such as an M&amp;A deal) which it may wish to temporarily keep under wraps.</p>
<p>However, he acknowledges that smaller deals, certainly less than a couple of million dollars, will see very little benefit from the algo trade execution process. “Algos only really thrive with large orders; with voice or electronic platform trades the spreads on small orders will be so tight there is no need for the corporates to take on extra market risk. Where you have a large trade or a difficult currency pair, algos are a perfect choice.”</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p><i>The pressure is on for corporate treasurers to do more with less. Straight-through reconciliation is something which can help to free up time for treasury teams whilst simultaneously bringing about vast improvements in the efficiency of the working capital cycle. But before we can begin to think of ways to improve a process, it might be helpful to first reacquaint ourselves with the basics. In this article, we look at what the reconciliation process is, why it is important to treasurers, and what companies can do to optimise the exercise.</i></p>
<p>It’s no secret that corporate treasury teams today are feeling ever more squeezed, both in terms of their time and resources. It’s something that industry experts are calling the ‘T-bar’ effect. Not only have treasurers been taking on an increasingly strategic role within their organisations in recent years, but they are also having to juggle those new responsibilities with a more extensive operational role too.</p>
<p>Streamlining the account reconciliation not only frees up time that treasurers can then re-deploy to strategic matters, it could also – by enhancing the working capital cycle – make a tangible impact on the bottom line. But what exactly is reconciliation and what does it mean for your business?</p>
<p>The term reconciliation refers to the process of ensuring that two independent sets of records – typically the balances of two accounts – are in agreement. At a fundamental level, it is an activity individuals often perform every day or so, when we check our bank account balance to make sure that each transaction is valid. The reasons are similar in the business context. It is performed for the purpose of internal control; to check for fraud and to prevent errors and ensure financial statements contain accurate information. This is vital because for publicly traded companies in particular, the occurrence of such errors can have very serious implications.</p>
<h3 id="bank-reconciliations">Bank reconciliations</h3>
<p>A general ledger – colloquially known as ‘the books’ – is a collection of all balance sheet and income statements, thereby offering a complete record of every transaction over the life of a company. Supporting the general ledger are sub-ledgers, containing details of transactions within a specific account, like the detail for all issued invoices and cash receipts held in accounts receivable, for example. Sub-ledgers are typically summarised before being posted to the general ledger at the end of each business day.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote>Streamlining the account reconciliation not only frees up time that treasurers can then re-deploy to strategic matters, it could also – by enhancing the working capital cycle – make a tangible impact on the bottom line.</blockquote>

<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>There is always the possibility of errors, however. To check all accounts are accurate, it is necessary to reconcile the balances of the general ledger with the balances of the sub-ledger on a periodic basis in order to identify any inaccuracies in the data. The process begins by analysing the general ledger and the sub-ledger balances to identify any differences, paying close attention to items such as non-recurring transactions where the potential for error is highest.</p>
<p>Naturally, this is quite a complex process when performed in a corporate environment where hundreds of thousands of transactions may be flowing in and out on a daily basis. This means it is imperative to have technology, an ERP or specialist payments software that can provide a degree of automation to various stages of the process.</p>
<p>When a company receives a bank statement, it is also necessary to verify that the amounts detailed on the statement are consistent with the amounts in the company’s general ledger, a process called bank reconciliation. Again, this can be a cumbersome process, not least because amounts which appear in the company’s cash account one month might not appear on a bank statement until later. There are a number of circumstances that could lead to such outcomes. A cheque might, for example, be written at the end of February, which would not clear the bank account until early March – even though the amount would, in all likelihood, have been deducted immediately. An alternative example would be a bank service charge deducted at the end of the month, but not seen on a bank statement until early the next. Obviously, given the two examples provided above, there are often differences found between the balances on a bank statement and the balances of cash accounts. In order to report a true and accurate cash position, some degree of adjustment may be required.</p>
<h3 id="step-by-step">Step-by-step</h3>
<p>If there is one golden rule of the bank reconciliation process it is to add the values present on one set of records but absent on the others. The details of the process can be summed up in a few key steps. Here we provide a brief overview of each step, including the key things that the individual or team performing the reconciliations should look out for:</p>
<h4 id="adjust-the-balance-per-bank">1. Adjust the balance per bank</h4>
<p>Adjusting the balance on the bank statement to the true balance should be the very first step. To achieve this, one will need to add deposits that are in transit, deduct any outstanding cheques and account for any bank errors that are identified.</p>
<p>In the case of deposits in transit, that is amounts which have been received and recorded but do not appear yet on the bank statement, there is no need to adjust the company’s records. They must, however, be listed on the bank reconciliation as an “increase in the balance per bank”, in order that the true cash position be reported.</p>
<p>Similarly outstanding cheques that have been written and recorded in the company’s cash account, but have not yet cleared do not mean that the company’s records have to be adjusted. A “decrease in the balance per bank” should, however, be listed on the bank reconciliation.</p>
<p>Finally, the bank should be notified of any errors it has made on a transaction, whether that be an incorrect amount or omission of an amount. The adjustment made might be an increase or decrease in the balance shown on the bank statement, depending on the nature of the error. Once again, the company’s own records are left unchanged.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Once the balance per bank has been adjusted it is necessary to look at what might need to be amended on the company’s own books. This entails making deductions for items such as bank service charges, unpaid cheques, and cheque printing charges. Interest earnings and notes receivable collected by the bank must be added, while errors in the company’s cash account may need to added or deducted depending on the nature of the error.</p>
<p>First on the list of things to be deducted are bank service charges, the fees deducted from the bank statement charged for the bank’s services on the checking account. The banks might deduct such charges without prior notification. Indeed, the company usually only learns such amounts have been deducted after receiving its statement from the bank. Since the charges have already been deducted from the bank statement, the only adjustment needed to be made is to a decrease of the relevant amount in the company’s cash account.</p>
<p>Once these and any unpaid cheques and cheque printing fees have been deducted, the final step is to add values which increase the balances on the company’s chequing accounts but have not yet been listed on the books. Notes receivable, documents such as promissory notes issued as evidence of debt, fall into this category, as do interest earned on account balances. Again, these figures will be automatically added to the bank statement, so to reconcile one must simply add what is on the bank statement to the books.</p>
<h4 id="compare-adjusted-balances">3. Compare adjusted balances</h4>
<p>Now that adjustments have been made to the balance per bank and the balance per books, the respective amounts should be of equal value. If that is not the case an error has evidently been made, and the process must be repeated again – checking carefully for anything overlooked on the first occasion – until the values shown on each are identical. To complete the process, adjustments made to the balance of books must be recorded through journal entries, whilst any adjustments to the cash balance will need to be addressed by crediting one account from another.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><h3 id="why-is-bank-reconciliation-important">Why is bank reconciliation important?</h3>
<p>As we can see from the above, the bank reconciliation process might end up being a very lengthy, protracted procedure, especially in large organisations. Without the right technology in place, it may mean trawling through dozens of general and sub-ledgers and bank statements from a multitude of accounts covering, in some cases, hundreds of thousands of transactions. And even when there is an ERP or TMS that is able to perform some of the heavy lifting, some degree of manual intervention is almost always required. So why do companies go to all the trouble of performing this exercise on a regular basis?</p>
<p>The answer is relatively straightforward: risk. If bank reconciliation is not performed on a timely basis, the company would consequently be exposing itself to enormous risks. These risks manifest themselves in a number of forms. The company might, for example, have individuals stealing from its accounts. Equally, the company’s banks might be making fee mistakes and charging the company too much. Without banking reconciliation procedures in place to ensure the accuracy of the books and accounts, there is a possibility that neither issue would come to the attention of the company.</p>
<p>If the balances at the company’s various banks can be confirmed to be correct, by comparing them with the accounting records, however, it can provide an added level of confidence to the treasurer that what he sees in the books is an accurate representation of the company’s cash position. Such information is vital, not only to help the treasurer make important decisions about investments and financing requirements, but also to certify that everything is in check for the auditors. Bank reconciliation, then, should be seen as a critical control to ensure a company’s financial integrity.</p>
<h3 id="best-practices-in-bank-reconciliation">Best practices in bank reconciliation</h3>
<p>Considering both the scale and importance of bank reconciliation, corporates will naturally want to optimise the way the process is performed as much as possible. Thankfully, there are a number of well-established guidelines companies can follow to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of their reconciliation practices and avoid some of the common, yet preventable, problems that can occur.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of things companies can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Rationalise the number of bank accounts.</h5>
<p>As a business grows and new processes are introduced, bank accounts quickly begin to accumulate. Quite often companies will find themselves with a large number of bank accounts that are effectively redundant. Of course, the greater the number of accounts one has, the greater the workload when it comes to performing bank reconciliations. If the treasury is able to perform a regular account reconciliation exercise, therefore, they might find the number of account reconciliations required can be dramatically reduced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Automate (as much as possible).</h5>
<p>Manual reconciliations will always be prone to error, no matter how meticulously the process is performed. In companies with high transaction volumes, the need for a high level of manual input can also be very time consuming, costly and, not to mention, open to fraud. Therefore using tailored reconciliation software which can be deployed quickly, flexibly and cost effectively can be extremely beneficial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Reconcile daily.</h5>
<p>Performing account reconciliations on a daily basis can provide the treasurer with greater assurance over the general ledger balances. It can also help the team to keep on top of the work. After all, reconciling a handful of transactions at the end of each day should be much less demanding than tackling a whole multitude at the end of the month. Don’t let them build up.</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p><em>Historically corporate cards have fallen under the purview of the Travel Manager, with specific programmes and providers being chosen via a standard tender process overseen by Purchasing. However, as businesses continue to look for simplified payments processes and the ability to gain more control over working capital – cards-based payments are increasingly becoming a more logical fit within Treasury and Finance to support a holistic payments and cash management agenda. By moving beyond travel and entertainment (T&amp;E) and other day-to-day business expenses, cards can be a vital tool in a company’s payment mix for reducing costs and improving supplier relationships.</em></p>

<br/>
<p>Peggy Yankovich is Global Head of Corporate Cards for HSBC’s Global Payment and Cash Management Group. She leads the global strategy, development, commercialization and optimization for Corporate Card Products and solutions.</p>
</div>
<p>Over time, cards have evolved from T&amp;E to purchasing and more recently to virtual card buyer-initiated payments. This evolution has brought with it a critical enhancement to cash flow management in the form of increased controls, streamlined processes and reduced costs.</p>
<p>“Savvy CFOs have begun to recognise the cash management benefits cards can offer,” says Peggy Yankovich, Senior Vice President and Global Head of Corporate Cards for HSBC’s Global Payments and Cash Management Group. “Today’s treasuries are looking for partners who can deliver a full-service, one-stop-shop for a wide range of payment types – from traditional payments including SEPA, BACS and ACH, to cross-border settlements with built in FX pricing and supplier financing, to file-based card payments.” In addition to this, Yankovich adds, companies want solutions that offer a consistency of service for easy integration into existing processes and financial management platforms, and greater efficiency and economies of scale in markets around the world.</p>
<h3 id="an-effective-cash-management-tool">An effective cash management tool</h3>
<p>Cards work as an effective cash management tool for all types and sizes of business, and at all stages of growth and development. For example, when a company’s cash position is low they can push a wider range of purchases through cards in order to defer payments. This includes regular business expenses such as employee travel and office supplies, as well as any vendor or service provider that will take a credit card – from advertisers and printers, to utilities and global suppliers.</p>
<p>With a typical 30-day billing cycle and payments due 25 days after the statement date, using cards to make payments can help companies hold on to cash longer with as much as a 55-day float. Alternatively, cash rich businesses can design card programmes that offer rebates or reinvestment at various spending benchmarks to continue building on liquidity reserves.</p>
<p>For payments not initiated by a corporate card, virtual card programmes deliver similar benefits with increased float and potential rebates. These programmes manage the final phase of a transaction – payment and settlement only. All other purchase order and invoice processes remain the same. With this, payments that would traditionally be made by cheque are converted into card transactions to further streamline processes and reduce costs. There is also no physical card. Instead, individual account numbers are generated for each transaction, which adds security.</p></img></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Whether traditional or virtual, cards-based payments can also strengthen supplier relationships by giving them access to payments earlier than typical purchase order and check processes. This is an ideal solution for companies that might not qualify for supplier finance programmes through normal channels as it effectively reduces Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) for suppliers while also helping businesses maintain or in some cases even lengthen their own Days Payable Outstanding (DPO).</p>

<h3 id="card-payment-solution-overview">Card Payment Solution Overview</h3>
<p>As a cash management strategy, cards-based payments can:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Help reduce the number of POs that need to be processed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase savings by replacing hundreds of invoices with a single payment per month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce the need for petty cash altogether.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase control over outgoing cash with the ability to set transaction and monthly limits, as well as implement supplier and MCC blocks.</p>

<li>
<p>Further support the move from paper-intensive operations to more automated, electronic environments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 id="enhanced-visibility-adds-control">Enhanced visibility adds control</h3>
<p>Cards are quickly becoming a significant component of larger treasury initiatives, effectively supporting everything from cutting costs and negotiating better deals with suppliers, to enhancing cash flow and improving working capital.</p>
<p>According to Yankovich, the key here is gaining knowledge through easy access to reporting. “Card programmes by their nature capture more data at the point of payment, much more than is available in a check-based environment,” she explains. “Global, summary level transaction reporting consolidates information across all business locations, giving companies much deeper visibility into spending and outgoing payments by country and supplier.”</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>To simplify expense management further, reports can be delivered in daily transmission files that are formatted for seamless integration into third-party applications such as Concur, SAP and Oracle, among others. This, Yankovich says, provides treasury with the critical insight necessary to realise their primary objectives.</p>
<h3 id="stakeholder-involvement-critical-for-success">Stakeholder involvement critical for success</h3>
<p>When part of a total solution, cards can enhance a company’s ability to monitor, manage and reconcile payments – ultimately helping them gain more control over outgoing cash to improve working capital. Implementing a global B2B cards programme designed to realise these goals, however, requires getting the right stakeholders involved from the outset. These include representatives from the following departments:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Procurement:</h5>
<p>Contract Negotiations and Project Management: These teams perform internal project analysis, validate supplier and end user criteria and define the programme administrator’s role and monitoring processes as well as support end user/supplier enablement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Accounts Payable:</h5>
<p>To provide input into the set up of ERP data feeds content and designate a process owner for handling ERP data integration and supplier payment detail maintenance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Systems and IT:</h5>
<p>Giving additional input into the set of up ERP data formats and content, and supports export routine of validation tables for GCMs and import routine for ERP data feeds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Compliance and Audit:</h5>
<p>Here, specialists offer guidance on compliance and audit process requirements and identify a person responsible for programme auditing (if it does not already reside within the Programme Administrator role).</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Finance:</h5>
<p>To provide input to project scoping, compliance and audit processes, and finance reporting requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Treasury:</h5>
<p>Adding input on project scoping and other functions specific to the particular business.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-holistic-view-of-payments-processes">A holistic view of payments processes</h3>
<p>This type of cross-functional support for a B2B cards programme is pivotal to its success, say Yankovich. “In HSBC’s experience, programmes that take the conventional path of a Procurement led tender process followed by an introduction to the wider business only at the point of implementation typically under perform.”</p>
<p>To achieve this, it’s important to move away from the view that cards are a standalone solution. While cards do offer the benefits of simplified expense management from an employee spending perspective, the streamlined flow of information can deliver much more to a company’s cash management processes and the overall working capital strategy.</p>
<p>As a result, the right provider must offer a full suite of payments solutions from local and regional, to international and multi-currency; as well as high and low value, bulk or single payments, and in paper, plastic and electronic formats. The ideal cards solution would deliver one seamless process that integrates easily into existing payments flows and minimises the complexities and financial impact of foreign exchange.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>For a multinational payment solution, it is advantageous for companies to look to a full service international bank – one that not only has the suite of products necessary, but also offers superior connectivity across all markets to support global initiatives. And since no two businesses are alike, a partner with the expertise to provide a consultative approach to each situation will help ensure success. This involves gaining a greater understanding of the businesses’ unique needs and objectives across all functional areas and fully analysing existing processes and inefficiencies to recommend a mix of products and services to create a holistic payments and cash management solution.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><i>To outsource or not to outsource is a question which many corporates will have faced over the years. For a number of reasons, the answer for the majority has been ‘not’. However in recent times treasury outsourcing has made something of a return and is offering an option to corporates looking to reduce costs and increase efficiency. In this article, Treasury Today Asia looks at what treasury outsourcing actually is, its uses, and the debate surrounding the practice.</i></p>
<p>Outsourcing, the process of transferring a portion of a business’s operations out to a third-party provider, is something which generates an eclectic mix of opinions. For some, outsourcing an area of business responsibilities can be seen as a way to reduce costs, improve efficiency and free time to perform value-add duties. For others, it can be perceived as a threat which can cause a loss of control, loss of power and a loss of jobs. Despite this, outsourcing is something which many businesses participate in, primarily outsourcing high-volume functions such as human resources and IT, and have done for many years.</p>
<p>Treasury is another area where outsourcing was touted to be a revolutionary concept, redefining the role of the function when first introduced in the late 1980s. However, for a number of reasons the adoption of treasury outsourcing was neither widespread nor long-lived (in the main). In more recent times outsourcing has made a return, not as the revolutionary concept it once claimed to be, but as a genuine option for companies to consider when looking at ways to improve their treasury function. However, many still are not fully aware of what treasury outsourcing actually is and what it can offer.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-treasury-outsourcing">What is treasury outsourcing?</h3>
<p>Simply put, treasury outsourcing is the outsourcing of all or part of the treasury function to a third-party outsourcing provider, or shared service centre. However, within this simplistic definition there are many nuances. “The industry still hasn’t been exactly defined,” says Gautam Dhillon, Founder and CEO at treasury outsourcing provider, The Treasury Outsourcing Company (TOC). “Many companies offer treasury outsourcing services,” says Dhillon. “Banks for example offer netting and pooling services, some companies offer front office outsourcing solutions and others middle and back office. The scope and variety of services is large and occasionally fragmented. To overcome this problem we have a simple model where we offer a complete tactical and operational outsourcing solution. The client can choose to outsource its entire front, middle and back office or components of each; with each activity being performed on world-class TMS.”</p>
<p>Treasury outsourcing services can generally be viewed along a spectrum of treasury operations. “At one end you have the bottom-end, high-volume processes, such as payments processing, which treasurers can outsource on an operational basis,” says Jackie Bowie, CEO at financial risk consultants J.C. Rathbone Associates. “At the other end of the spectrum there are the high-end acute decision-making processes which require technical and current market expertise, such as hedging strategies, which can also be outsourced on an ad-hoc/project-by-project basis.”</p>
<p>Just as there are two forms of outsourcing, discretionary and operational, there are two major types of third-party outsourcing provider. Firstly, banks can offer a range of treasury outsourcing services. Although this section of the market has been scaled back in recent years, one bank which still offers these services is Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofAML). “Our outsourcing services complement the products which we offer,” says Suzanne Janse van Rensburg, Regional Head of Liquidity and Investments, GTS EMEA, BofAML. “And we are able to offer these services with the expertise and support of the bank fully behind it.”</p>
<p>The second type of outsourcing service provider is independent companies that focus on treasury as a key competency. “It is important that a treasury outsourcing provider has a treasury orientation,” says Pat Leavy, Executive Director at FTI Treasury, a provider of treasury outsourcing solutions. “The concentration should therefore be on practical corporate treasury risk management and for this corporate treasury expertise and knowledge are required in addition to treasury technology and best practice processes, which third-party providers like us can deliver.”</p>
<p>Providers of outsourced treasury technology, known as Application Service Providers (ASPs) are also regarded as third-party treasury service providers. These offer companies the ability to hire costly treasury technology such as a TMS, thus allowing the corporate to avoid many of the costs associated with these. The trade-off comes with the limited flexibility and customisation offered by many ASPs.</p>
<h3 id="what-can-be-outsourced">What can be outsourced?</h3>
<p>Theoretically, all aspects of the treasury function can be outsourced. However it is extremely rare for a company to outsource all of its treasury activity. Due to this the treasury function is divided into three broad areas which can be outsourced; front office (execution), middle office (accounting and reporting) and the back office (settlement and reconciliation). The treasury can decide to outsource the entire office or alternatively some functions within it, keeping the others in-house.</p>
<p>How much of and what a treasury decides to outsource is very much based on the organisation’s individual circumstances and what can provide the most value. However, as FTI Treasury’s Leavy explains, there are four fundamental models of treasury outsourcing:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Full suite treasury outsourcing</h5>
<p>–this model sees the organisation outsource the front, middle and back office to a third party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Back and middle office outsourcing</h5>
<p>– through outsourcing the back and middle office the treasury can focus its in-house recourses on strategy and execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Regional treasury centre outsourcing</h5>
<p>– this model will see the outsource service provider manage the organisation’s regional cash and intercompany financing without the need for it to establish its own treasury function in the region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Standalone activity outsourcing</h5>
<p>– a company may choose to outsource a single activity should they not have the capabilities to carry it out in-house. Intercompany netting and intercompany lending provide good examples of these standalone activities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A new and relatively undeveloped area which can also be outsourced is a company’s disaster recovery. “Our research suggests that many treasuries do not have a satisfactory disaster recovery policy in place,” says TOC’s Dhillon, “so, if for any reason a company is unable to get into the office or the systems crash, there can be large ramifications.” For Dhillon, outsourcing provides a logical safeguard against any disaster scenario and ensures that the risk of this is mitigated. “This is further boosted with the advent of cloud technology, allowing outsourcing services to be hosted in the cloud, meaning regardless of the disaster the data will still be remotely accessible and useable.”</p>
<p>While many aspects of treasury can be outsourced, our experts agree that there are some areas which should be retained in house. These include core competencies such as strategy development and any decisions around treasury management such as key performance indicators and service level agreements with its outsourcing provider (OSP). Bank relationships and treasury controlling are another two areas which a treasury should keep firmly in-house.</p>
<h3 id="why-outsource">Why outsource?</h3>
<p>So far we have looked at what treasury outsourcing is and the areas of treasury which can be outsourced; but why would a treasury want to outsource its operations? The answer is primarily to reduce costs. There are however a number of other drivers which may lead a treasury to outsource its operations, which include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Technology</h5>
<p>– if a company is looking to purchase or update its legacy technology it may look to outsourcing as an alternative. In this relationship the set-up will be quicker and the ongoing maintenance of the technology removing the need for this expertise in-house.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Specialist expertise</h5>
<p>– a treasury may not have the expertise in certain areas and may therefore look to outsource these processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Processes</h5>
<p>– many treasuries with limited resources will often find they have a number of inefficiencies and an inadequate segregation of duties. Outsourcing some areas of the treasury function can help to resolve this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Location</h5>
<p>– if a company looks to expand to a new region it may wish to outsource its regional treasury for that region rather than build its own infrastructure.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The wide range of drivers for outsourcing means that it can offer value to companies throughout its life cycle. For example, a start-up looking to acquire a centralised treasury function can achieve this quickly, with support and without the costs associated with establishing its own through outsourcing. Alternatively a company which is in the growth stage of its life cycle may wish to outsource some of its processes to help with its development and then look to insource these at a later date. Finally, a mature company may wish to outsource to radically change the culture of the treasury.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h3 id="benefits">Benefits</h3>
<p>Other than the simple advantage of reducing costs, an outsourcing arrangement has the potential to deliver a number of additional benefits to the treasury and the organisation as a whole. These include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Allowing treasury to focus on strategy – as the treasury is being called upon to be more of a value-add strategic business partner, outsourcing the day-to-day activities can provide the in-house team with more time to focus on this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased focus on the activities which remain in-house, thereby increasing efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Organisational benefits – outsourcing can allow the treasury to improve its organisational structure and create an improved segregation of duties, mitigating the risk of fraud and error between back and front office activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reducing costs – the outsourcing provider should be able to make use of economies of scale and provide certain services at a lower cost than they would be if performed in-house.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speed of implementation – following fundamental shifts in the organisational structure of the company, a merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) for example, outsourcing can be used as a method to introduce the required new treasury activities more quickly than establishing these in-house.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flexibility – the outsourcing provider may be able to adapt to a corporate’s changing requirements quicker and more efficiently than if completed in-house.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data quality – very often an unanticipated outsourcing benefit is that the quality of the data that is produced is higher. The challenge for the corporate receiving the data is therefore how to use it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="concerns-around-outsourcing">Concerns around outsourcing</h3>
<p>Despite the benefits which outsourcing can offer corporates, there are a number of issues which are highlighted by treasury professionals about the practice which historically have prevented greater uptake.</p>
<p>The fear of relinquishing control surrounding treasury operations is the main issue around the practice of outsourcing. Although it is inevitable that by outsourcing a certain degree of control will be lost, the fear may often be overstated. “Despite the perceptions, in the outsourcing world most, if not all, the decisions and control remains in house,” says Leavy. “All actions taken by an outsourcer occur within discrete parameters and with very limited discretion from the provider’s point of view. The main decisions remain in-house – it is just the processes behind these which are outsourced.”</p>
<p>The seeds of this mind-set may be found during the early days of treasury outsourcing where it was promised to be revolutionary. “The initial vision of outsourcing was to outsource everything including decisions and strategy,” says Leavy. “This ultimately never happened and in reality shouldn’t.” For Leavy the mind-set remains because the purpose of outsourcing hasn’t been fully communicated to the treasury community.</p>
<p>Another area of potential concern regarding outsourcing is around security and this is something which should be considered carefully by treasurers when looking to establish an outsourcing arrangement. “Ensuring the client’s data is secure and confidential is critical and corporates need to be sure that the right security is in place,” says BofAML’s Janse van Rensburg. TOC’s Dhillon agrees. “There needs to be strict controls regarding who can access the data both within the OSP and once it is sent back to the client. If a service is web-based then encryption will also be required.”</p>
<p>In addition to the loss of control and security fears there may also be wider effects caused by outsourcing treasury operations which can cause issues for the department. One of these is job restructuring or job losses which can affect both the efficiency and moral of the treasury. A second area of potential concern surrounds the relationship which the treasury has with other operating units. By outsourcing, these relationships may be altered, so the impact of these should be carefully assessed by the department.</p>
<h3 id="full-value">Full value</h3>
<p>If a treasury decides to set foot into the outsourcing world, how can it ensure it receives full value from the arrangement? “An outsourcing relationship is very much like a marriage,” says TOC’s Dhillon. “Regardless of the client’s outsourcing motivations there should be constant dialogue between both sides with each understanding the scope of work, KPIs and SLAs. Once this happens the relationship is then on a firm footing.” For Dhillon this is the key to obtaining the most out of an outsourcing agreement and insists that a lack of dialogue and strategic scope alignment is a serious problem. “The clients who get the most out of the arrangement are the ones that enter the relationship with a clear scope. This then enables the OSP to deliver and be measured against demanding KPI and SLAs.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, the client has not fully scoped the requirements and proceeds to outsource treasury activities, this will be problematic even if the OSP is meeting all the KPIs and SLAs, since the strategic scoping exercise was incorrect. This means the client will ultimately be unhappy with the venture,” he says.</p>
<p>Engagement in the process and asking questions is also seen by Bowie as key to the treasury obtaining the most out of the arrangement. “This allows us to understand their concerns and tailor a solution to fit their individual needs,” she says. If they step back then often the outsourcing service provider will not feel fully briefed.” Many outsource providers are now also now able to provide flexible bespoke agreements to suit the diversity of corporate needs. This is, however, something which again can only be arrived at through dialogue.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h3 id="future-outsourcing">Future outsourcing</h3>
<p>“Corporates will say that they are outsourcing more now than ever before,” says Bowie. “However, this is rather misleading; prior to the financial crisis corporates were heavily reliant on their banks for both ideas and strategy. This may not have been perceived as outsourcing because there is no explicit fee for the services but in reality this was a form of quasi-outsourcing in itself.”</p>
<p>Despite the evolution of the market outsourcing is not yet a mainstream treasury practice and is still viewed by many through an outmoded lens. To change this, the industry is required to communicate the scope and benefits of outsourcing more efficiently to the treasury community. On the other hand the developing role of treasury may see the popularity of outsourcing increase. “Traditionally treasury has been seen as a cost centre,” says Dhillon. “If you outsource treasury processes the activity that was once seen as a cost centre becomes a profit centre for the OSP, this shift can be transformational for the treasury function and the captive organisation as a whole.”</p>
<p>It must be noted that a potential barrier to the greater use of treasury outsourcing in the future comes from the fact that operating costs have been able to be reduced, not through outsourcing but through automated cash management solutions. This has allowed corporates to remove a large degree of the recurring daily duties from their operations, although it must be noted that not all the benefits which can be obtained through an outsourcing agreement can be accessed this way.</p>
<p>Ultimately, outsourcing remains polarising amongst the treasury community. For some, outsourcing is a great way to reduce costs and create greater efficiencies in the treasury. For others, it is something which will lead to a loss of control. Then there are those that sit in the space between the two. So while not being the revolutionary solution it once promised to be, outsourcing must be regarded as another option open to treasurers when looking at ways to reduce costs and increase efficiency.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><i>Instead of trading separately and directly with a number of money market funds (MMFs), treasurers looking to optimise short-term yield on their cash holdings are increasingly turning to the single-platform/multi-fund MMF portals made available by banks and independent providers. What are they and what do they offer corporate users?</i></p>
<p>Money market funds (MMFs) are gaining ground in the short-term space as bank deposits typically remain low or zero yield. The method of accessing funds is changing to meet investor needs and the online multi-bank portal is becoming an increasingly attractive proposition for busy treasurers. The third annual cash management study issued at the end of 2013 by technology vendor, SunGard, collated the responses of 160 corporates globally and found a reduction in the use of telephone transactions for short-term investments from 51% in 2012 to 30% in 2013, in favour of web-based portals.</p>
<p>The attractions of largely automated trading platforms are many, not least being that some also enable other products to be traded too (such as short-duration bonds, separately managed accounts and certificates of deposit). In the MMF space, in addition to the facilitation of trade and settlement across multiple funds and providers, portals typically offer a range of pre- and post-trade services including market intelligence, consolidated reporting, trading access and authorisation, limit setting, position and risk analysis (from counterparty to country risk). By providing market and counterparty intelligence, trading and monitoring all under one roof, treasurers seemingly have access to a one-stop MMF shop. But are all portals created equal?</p>
<h3 id="portal-differences">Portal differences</h3>
<p>Multi-fund MMF portals may be offered either by international banks such as Citi and BNY Mellon or by independent providers such as MyTreasury, ICD and SunGard. This is the first great divide – and users seem to be swinging slowly towards the independents, having favoured bank platforms since they first arrived a decade or so ago. Of those that now use portals, the number of treasurers working with independent providers over proprietary bank offerings is rising, according to the SunGard survey. It shows that 35% of all portal users now prefer the independent option, an increase of 15% over the previous year.</p>
<p>Independent providers will always argue that they are cheaper for investors to use but banks will often bundle together their offering with other services such as custody, cash sweeping or asset management, which can create certain operational efficiencies. Whilst this tends to make the true cost of the portal easier to absorb, the flipside is that actual cost is less easy to discern.</p>
<p>The range of fund participation in a bank portal may be limited compared to an independent. This may influence a treasurer’s decision where there is a need for portfolio diversification, although a portfolio of around five to ten is typically used. Banks often have distribution agreements with their fund participants which may be seen as encouraging partiality where advice is offered. Of the independents, ICD and SunGard are permitted to offer investment advice, and are thus regulated, whereas MyTreasury is concerned mainly with (and therefore earns its keep through) transaction processing and execution.</p></div>

</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Banks typically offer ‘omnibus’ trading portals, which means the provider will set up and manage accounts on behalf of its users allowing trading and settlement (through a central clearing agent) to take place en masse and anonymously. As independent portal providers, both SunGard and MyTreasury offer ‘fully-disclosed’ direct trading platforms, which allow treasurers to trade directly with each fund on the platform – their independent competitor, ICD, provides a mix of direct, clearing bank facilitated and omnibus trading which clients can use in combination.</p>
<p>With direct trading systems the fund provider knows who its client is. For treasurers, maintaining visibility of ‘share of the wallet’ may be important. For other traders, particularly hedge funds, anonymity may be preferred. If using a bank portal, it may be perceived by other institutions on the treasury’s bank panel as giving that bank preferential treatment; conversely it may be the intention to overtly give that bank the business.</p>
<p>Broadly, the omnibus model offers simplicity and ease of use but trading authority is given away with an omnibus account. Direct trading is more transparent and controllable. The investor opens one account with the portal provider and the portal provider opens an undisclosed account with all of the funds, doing all the admin such as account opening and settlement on the investor’s behalf. Fund providers do not have access to their investors. A disclosed nominee account may be opened in the investor’s name, but this account is still owned by the portal provider. If something happens to the portal provider or an intermediary, such as a clearer, if the client is an undisclosed nominee its anonymity means it will not be able to approach the fund providers; as a disclosed nominee the issue remains that the trading account actually belongs to the portal provider and unless the client is a signatory on that account, return of funds is unlikely until the problem has been resolved. Most omnibus portal users do not have delegated trading authority on their own accounts.</p>
<h3 id="background-movements">Background movements</h3>
<p>At the front end, the look and feel of portals will be quite similar; the difference is all in the set-up where, depending on which portal is being used, trades may be routed through a clearing partner or direct to the fund provider.</p>
<p>Background processes such as clearing and settlement vary according to portal type. Omnibus platforms may offer auto-settlement or direct settlement. Auto-settlement platforms do away with manual processing and payment and settlement requests. Automation will make all the trades across all accounts for the client and will net off all investments and redemptions before calculating what is owed. This does present an element of risk; whilst the money is in transit, if the clearing bank being used by the portal to facilitate the movement gets into financial trouble then the investor’s payment will be locked into the system until such time as the clearer emerges from administration. Bear Stearns was such a clearer, rescued by J.P. Morgan. Auto-settlement is now optional rather than mandatory for most providers.</p>
<p>An alternative omnibus model will execute trades for the client, the client settling directly with each fund, going through the normal payment process for the business as if it was trading outside of the platform. Reference to direct trading on an omnibus account does not mean trading directly with the fund; it refers only to the settlement process. Settlement through a fully direct trading portal typically uses the same direct settlement process as for omnibus although MyTreasury offers an auto-settlement feature developed with Honeywell (<a href="#case-study">see case study</a>).</p>
<h3 id="added-value">Added-value</h3>
<p>By building in compliance features such as trader limits, counterparty limits and maximum holdings, for example, a portal can automatically monitor every transaction. Electronic portals consolidate huge amounts of investment data and so reporting functions have notably improved in the past few years. ICDs offering, for example, allows users to import external investments (such as bank and time deposits) into its exposure analytics component to give a broad picture.</p>
<p>In addition to consolidated views of exposures, counterparty, currency and liquidity positions, a host of management information may be made available to users, depending upon the provider. These tools may show levels of activity and risk by country, asset type, maturity and so on and may be used to inform asset allocation. Market research, intelligence (including counterparty metrics such as stock price trends, CDS spreads and capital adequacy ratios), market price and news feeds are also typically delivered.</p>
<h3 id="cost">Cost</h3>
<p>The explicit cost of using a portal as an investor is zero because the cost of providing a portal is borne by the fund providers. However, for an investor it is important to ask each fund it is already using – or intends to use – whether trading on a portal will alter its terms of trade compared to direct trade. Some funds operate a ‘portal’ share class, using this to effectively charge investors as an offset against the fees it pays to the portal provider.</p>
<h3 id="the-valuation-debate">The valuation debate</h3>
<p>The ongoing discussion about MMF valuations, systemic risk and the various proposals for reform put forward by the EC and, in the US, the SEC, will have some impact on the way in which portals operate. The key requirement, if the shift is made to floating Net Asset Value (VNAV) funds will be how the portal provider will get information from the fund transfer agents in a timely manner. The agent, usually a bank, looks after records of investors, account balances and transactions and will provide the actual share price required for daily valuation. With constant NAV (CNAV), investors know the value is ‘one’ (dollar/pound/euro) and for accounting purposes this makes life relatively easy. VNAV brings uncertainty to valuation. On a daily basis portal providers will have to get the price in good time. It may be that cut-off times for investment may have to be brought forward, which for investors is going in the wrong direction. The decision is yet to be made.</p></div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Even if floating NAV is the way forward, the focus by almost all portals on prime institutional AAA-rated CNAV funds is unlikely to shift by any great magnitude (assuming the regulators’ proposal to abandon fund ratings is dropped). However, whilst treasurers will not necessarily want to have to seek permission to invest in new funds, if the reforms are accepted some portals may open up to a broader range of fund-types, even exchange-traded funds.</p>
<p>Firstly, this will require significant technological development on the part of the portal providers to accommodate the different fund processing models. And secondly, it would change the risk profile of MMFs. CNAV funds are sold on the back of their perceived robustness but when the US-based Reserve Primary Fund ‘broke the buck’ back in 2008, it cast a long shadow over CNAV money markets everywhere. The SEC stepped in with Rule 2a-7 requiring MMFs to restrict their underlying holdings’ average dollar-weighted portfolio maturity to 60 days or less, and for credit ratings no more than 3% of assets must be in securities falling below the top two ratings. If the sanctity of MMF fund robustness is to be maintained, for all the discussion it may just be business as usual for most providers.</p>
<h3 id="integration">Integration</h3>
<p>Treasurers are now able to source market, trade and position data, with most platforms at least offering market views, size of funds, current and historical yield, portfolio information and analytics, and account balances. The discussion about which data is required, when and in which format, should be ongoing and reflective of the changing needs of treasurers and the need to integrate data with existing treasury systems. The closer the integration the more likely straight through processing can be achieved, eliminating the need to re-key daily rate and trade confirmations, for example.</p>

<img alt="Honeywell" class="logo org" height="17" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/honeywell-red-logo-2013-90x17.png" width="90"/>
<p class="management-summary">Honeywell is a US-based Fortune 100 diversified technology and manufacturing business which in 2013 reported global sales of $39.1 billion. Globally, Honeywell manages over $7 billion of cash and investments and a component of that is invested in MMFs. All MMF trades in EMEA and APAC today are executed and managed using the MyTreasury MMF portal.</p>
<p>The in-house bank which centralises the cash and provides funding to the affiliates is located in Belgium and overseen by the firm’s Director of Treasury, EMEA, Séverine Le Blévennec. In 2009, when a European regulatory shift ended the in-house bank’s Coordination Centre status, investment in MMFs became possible. With the cash balance notably increasing and the “investible universe of banks” decreasing, it led directly to the implementation of ICAP’s MyTreasury MMF portal. Although Honeywell’s treasury team had been part of a panel of investors that two years prior helped the vendor develop its platform, it still made market comparisons before selecting.</p>
<p>The set-up and integration of the portal was a fairly straightforward process, says Le Blévennec. The project started with the in-house bank and then rolled out to the UK before taking in the Asian markets. Honeywell sent documents to its existing fund providers explaining that beyond a specified date it would only be dealing through the portal. Where existing funds were not already on the platform the invitation was extended to join it, Honeywell having insisted that if the fund was not on the platform it would not deal with it at all. Only one agent (not the fund itself) declined the offer. For those that did, the terms and conditions of trading remain the same or better, she reports.</p>
<p>Le Blévennec notes too that the visibility and transparency that the platform provides over management fees has enabled her to negotiate rebates with various fund managers; in total it has amounted to a return of around $1m, although the low-rate environment has seen some euro funds subsequently cancel their rebates.</p>
<p>One of the key features of MyTreasury for Le Blévennec is its workflow system and ability to set up investment limits in the system. This means there is no need to monitor sub-limits of certain funds. “The platform gives us a view of the aggregate position of all money invested in the same fund. We can set limits and if a new deal would breach one of them, the system sends a warning message. A further control sends an e-mail message in case post trading, the fund AUM decreases causing us to be in breach.”</p>
<p>Honeywell helped MyTreasury develop a feature for reporting underlying exposures, aggregated across all of its funds on the system. This is downloaded as an Excel workbook enabling, for example, a view of the exposure to a specific institution or country across all 68 accounts. Given the volatility of some markets this is a welcome insight. “We could not have done it manually. With this function, if I have any doubts I can download the data and quickly take a decision to rebalance my funds.”</p>
<p>Today, the Group invests in six of the main currencies and has in the region of 40 active funds globally across the 68 accounts (different investors in the group can invest in the same fund). The only countries where Honeywell invests in MMF and where the MyTreasury system is not available yet are China, India and Japan, although the latter is in the pipeline.</p>
<p>Following geographical extension of the system’s use Honeywell worked on portal integration with its SunGard Quantum TMS. This has enabled a high degree of straight through processing, with all transactions being entered automatically for exposure management and settlement for the in-house bank. The interface to the TMS was also further developed to automate the booking of dividend (or rebate) distribution as well as day-to-day accruals on outstanding funds. MyTreasury has also developed an auto-settlement process for Honeywell where each trade automatically generates a SWIFT MT101 payment instruction.</p>
<p>For any treasurer considering using an MMF portal, Le Blévennec advises close inspection of the potential for platform customisation, particularly for reporting. Platform scalability is also important, as is user-friendliness and the ease of integration with existing technology. “I would also ask for references from a number of customers with a similar or more complex business profile who have been using the system extensively.” As a final point she expresses the need for a pro-active and open approach from the provider. “It is easy to deliver a platform where you just execute deals, but the devil is in the detail; when it starts to get more complex you will start to see the difference.”</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p><i>If there is one unifying theme running through nearly all the changes seen in the world of corporate treasury since the crisis it is that of transparency. For evidence of this trend, one needs to look no further than the growing reporting burden. Boards and senior corporate management, concerned about their companies’ financial health, have begun to demand increasingly accurate and timely data on their companies’ financial health. But that is not the only driver. Reporting requirements have also been at the centre of a number of the regulatory changes introduced in recent years. In this article, we return to the fundamentals of treasury reporting and look at the ways in which the practise has changed.</i></p>
<p>Nobody likes nasty surprises, least of all corporate treasurers. That is why, for the treasurer, having the proper data and intelligence is vital. Treasurers need to be able to view and report on a wide range of business intelligence data including exposures, hedging positions, cash forecasts and debts. The board demand it, external regulators demand it and, increasingly, treasurers themselves are demanding it.</p>
<p>Of course, without the help of a TMS, making sense of the data can be hard work – but any treasurer would agree that’s more preferable to the shock of discovering a financial exposure after it is too late to doing anything about it. With an effective, cohesive reporting framework in place the treasury team should be able to quickly identify, quantify and manage the various financial risks that their companies face.</p>
<p>Opinions often differ on precisely what should be reported and in what way, but there are some basic elements to consider. In this article, we will return to these basics, outlining the fundamental areas that should be reported and how they should be reported.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-report">How to report</h3>
<p>Each company is unique in its structure, size and nature of operations. While all these factors influence the format and scope of treasury reports and result in a variety of potential reporting styles, several features and guidelines are applicable to all treasury reports. Perhaps the most important aspect to remember is that any report produced, must be used – whether internally, or as part of an external management process. In order to be used, it needs to be usable. This means producing a report to the required timeline. The report should also be in a user-friendly format, so the relevant information is easily accessible.</p>
<h3 id="the-format-of-management-reports">The format of management reports</h3>
<p>Information should be supplied in a clear, concise and reliable format. Certain features help to achieve this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Reliability</h5>
<p>Senior management must be able to rely on the accuracy of the information given.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Brevity</h5>
<p>The level of detail needs to guarantee that all relevant information has been given, but details are only important to senior management if they are crucial to general decision-making. Whenever possible, the focus should be on key issues, presented in the form of rules and principles, rather than a list of details. A summary of the key points can help to focus on the relevant information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Language</h5>
<p>It is vital to present key information using clear and understandable language. Whenever possible, the use of mathematics and calculations should be avoided and their meaning and effects should be expressed in plain words. Management commentary is an essential element of reporting and increases the accessibility and usability of management reports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Illustration</h5>
<p>Showing is often more convincing than merely telling. Therefore reports can often benefit from graphs and illustrations to emphasise or explain important points.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Expert opinion on what items should be reported, and in what level of detail, will often vary to a certain extent. However, there are a number of fundamental areas for reporting that are common to most treasuries.</p>
<h3 id="cash-flow-forecast">Cash flow forecast</h3>
<p>Cash flow forecasting aims to increase the visibility of cash and liquidity positions of a firm. By predicting future cash surpluses or deficits, cash flow forecasts enable treasurers to gain a picture of investment options or borrowing requirements in advance. For a comprehensive picture a range of timescales – yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly – should be covered. Longer-term forecasts are most useful for acquiring notice of potential financing requirements so that the extension or renewal of debt facilities can be coordinated in a timely manner. Short-term forecasts, on the other hand, tend to be used more for managing day-to-day liquidity.</p>
<p>The first step, logically, is to collect the required data – recurring outflows and inflows and accounts payable (AP) and accounts receivable (AR) – usually via a TMS, ERP, or bank feed. Once these figures have been collected the next job is to analyse and make sense of it. Analysis can take various forms. It might be simply moving averages – the identification of future cash flow positions through historical data – or exponential smoothing, which is a similar process but with a variety of weightings added to the data, and finally, distribution modelling, which uses previous data patterns to extrapolate future trends. Technology such as a TMS can do a lot to simplify this stage of the forecast through the conversion of data into easy-to-read graphical forms such as charts and graphs. However, for a majority of treasuries manual input through Excel spreadsheets continues to be the main tool for executing such tasks.</p>
<h3 id="foreign-currency-transaction-exposure-reports">Foreign currency transaction exposure reports</h3>
<p>Reports that combine currency cash flow forecasts with an analysis of hedging transactions should be compiled for each country where the company has significant exposure. This can help to identify the firm’s net outstanding exposure over the relevant time period. For each period, the maximum expected loss from adverse currency movements should be estimated using a calculation of the level of net exposure, the duration for which the position is open and, lastly, the historical volatility of the currency pair in question.</p>
<p>Of course, when it comes to foreign exchange exposures it is the net gain or loss that really matters to the corporate treasurer. This is why more sophisticated treasury operations will often apply what is called a portfolio approach when calculating currency risk. The rationale of a portfolio approach is that while exchange rates can move in different directions on a daily basis, some currencies move in one direction and others in the opposite, thereby altering the cumulative level of risk. This is called ‘portfolio effect.’ In order to quantify and reveal the net exposure of a portfolio of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, an analysis of statistical correlations between changes in one rate and that of another using historical data needs to be performed. For the purpose of reporting, the results are usually set out in a correlation matrix displaying the correlation between all the exchange rates within the portfolio.</p>
<h3 id="debt-summary">Debt summary</h3>
<p>Management will naturally want to be regularly updated on the total level of debt the company has on the balance sheet. A debt summary will normally be prepared monthly. Details, by currency, are provided on the split between committed and uncommitted debt facilities. Debt maturity profiles of each facility are also compiled in order to highlight significant refinancing risks that might arise in the future. Corporates who do not use derivatives to hedge interest rate risks should also detail the split between fixed and floating rate debt to show the company’s exposure to adverse changes in interest rates.</p>
<h3 id="covenant-reports">Covenant reports</h3>
<p>Lenders will sometimes impose covenants when extending borrowing facilities to exert some control over the activities of the borrower. A covenant is essentially the setting of minimum financial performance standards that the borrower must achieve, for instance, the net worth of the company compared with its total debt. Since breaching any restrictions could result in the company being called into default, it is imperative for the corporate treasurer to frequently report on covenants internally and externally.</p>
<h3 id="interest-rate-gapping">Interest rate gapping</h3>
<p>An ‘interest rate gap’ report is a measurement of a company’s exposure to interest rate risks that is often used by the treasurer to help formulate hedging positions. Interest rate gap reports present an analysis of the company’s interest bearing assets and liabilities apportioned into future time bands when rates are reset.</p>
<p>The gap report table should be accompanied by a commentary outlining different interest rate scenarios and the various hedging strategies that could mitigate the impact of such exposures. A comparison of the company’s average weighted interest rate against current market rates or a measure of the performance of actual debt cost against current market rates or actual debt cost against a risk-neutral benchmark might also be included</p>
<h3 id="derivative-reporting">Derivative reporting</h3>
<p>Derivative products serve as useful tools for treasurers to manage their financial exposures, but can also carry significant risk if used inappropriately. It is very important, therefore, that the treasury monitors and manages not only the underlying exposure that they are hedging but also the instruments – futures, swaps, options and forwards – that they are hedging with. Regular reports should be compiled detailing all valuations, position balances and market exposures by product type, and any unhedged exposures also need to be noted. The importance of derivatives to the company should determine the frequency of this evaluation. For example, a large petrochemical multinational using a vast portfolio of different derivative products would clearly need to produce derivatives reports more frequently than a corporate that hedges less regularly. Naturally, regulation is also having a huge influence on external derivative reporting – see this month’s Insight &amp; Analysis article for more information.</p>
<h3 id="counterparty-credit-report">Counterparty credit report</h3>
<p>As the financial crisis reminded everybody, counterparty credit exposures can sometimes put the financial health of a company – its survival even – in serious jeopardy. Managing this risk means applying, and regularly monitoring, limits for each counterparty. All deposits and any derivatives contracts that are in place should be included in the scope of these reports and any change to a counterparty’s credit rating should precipitate a re-evaluation of the exposure limit attributed to that particular counterparty. There are two commonly used measurements of counterparty risk, value-at-risk (VaR) and earnings-at-risk.</p>
<p>VaR first emerged as a distinct financial concept in the years following the ‘Black Monday’ stock market crash in 1987. In basic terms, VaR is used by some companies to measure the worst-case scenario for their assets or liabilities. Market trends and fluctuations over certain time periods are analysed and, using the data accumulated, estimates of the largest loss that could be incurred under normal market conditions – or a 95% probability – can be determined. The longer the specified period, the greater the value (or earnings) at risk will be. Since the price movements of assets and liabilities are netted, the VaR associated with a given portfolio is likely to be less than the sum of its individual constituents.</p>
<p>VaR is a useful concept for financial reporting since it allows the treasurer to combine a range of financial risks faced by a company into one single measurement. There are some notable drawbacks which the treasurer should keep in mind, however. Firstly, VaR only accounts for financial risks. Since operational risks such as those in the supply chain are not included in the calculation, treasurers need to be aware that the metric does not provide a complete overview of the risks that a company faces at any given moment. Nevertheless, VaR is a useful tool for treasurers, particularly when it comes to establishing hedging strategies. Once the VaR associated with each hedging strategy has been determined, the treasurer can use the data to ensure the level of risk associated with the favoured strategy is acceptable.</p>
<p>An alternative to measuring VaR is to measure the company’s Earnings-at-Risk. This technique will produce similar results to VaR, but in the form of corporate earnings, rather than shareholder value. This is more valuable than VaR for measuring the impact of counterparty risk arising from customers. For example, a company with a small number of large value customers will find that a higher proportion of earnings are at risk should one customer either default on their obligations or fail to pay on time.</p>
<p>In addition, as this measure focuses on earnings, it is potentially of more immediate use than VaR for the treasurer. This is because it can assess the inflows at risk at any particular time.</p>
<h3 id="the-key-to-effective-reporting">The key to effective reporting</h3>
<p>Even now, nearly six years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the ensuing market chaos, the demand for enhanced reporting shows little sign of abating. In fact, given the large volume of new regulation affecting what companies need to report externally – FATCA and EMIR, for example – one could argue that the necessity for improvement is as strong as ever.</p>
<p>One thing that would improve the quality of most treasury reporting would be some careful consideration of what actually needs to be reported, rather than simply relying on previous formats. This will depend upon:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What the treasury needs to show management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What the treasury needs to provide to other departments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What information the treasury itself requires.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What analyses the treasury would like to do that have not been possible in the past.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Conducting a thorough analysis of what is required from a report and subsequently conveying those requirements to others can help reduce the reporting problems that often plague treasurers. It can also encourage a more open and effective attitude towards reporting throughout the company.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p><em>Additional Optional Services (AOS) could help drive SEPA efficiency for corporates, and a host of additional services are being developed. But what exactly are AOS? And how are they likely to evolve in the coming years following the SEPA migration deadline?</em></p>
<p>As the end of the grace period for the migration to SEPA looms, corporates that missed the February deadline are likely to be hard at work to ensure they are compliant come August. But even those for whom migration is now no longer a major concern may be asking themselves some questions: how can we derive greater value from the way we process payments in the SEPA environment? And what can our bank do to help us with this?</p>
<p>One potential answer is through Additional Optional Services (AOS). But what exactly are AOS and how are they implemented?</p>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<p>In the SEPA Credit Transfer (SCT) Rulebook, the European Payments Council (EPC) defines AOS as ‘complementary services based on the Scheme [SEPA] so as to meet further specific customer expectations,’ provided by individual participants and communities of participants.</p>
<p>The EPC goes on to identify two types of AOS. The first are those services provided by banks to their customers as value-added services based on core payment schemes.</p>
<p>The second type of AOS are those provided by voluntary groups of banks; these communities can be local, national or pan-European. The EPC cites the use of additional data elements in the ISO 20022 XML standards (the International Organisation for Standardisation’s standards for financial services messaging) as an example of this kind of AOS. The Council adds that any community usage rules for the use of the SEPA core mandatory subset of the ISO 20022 XML standards should be mentioned in the context of this type of service, even though ‘they are not per se AOS.’ It also says other AOS, such as community-provided delivery channels for customers, may be defined.</p>
<p>In order to fully understand AOS, it helps to know a little of their backstory.</p>
<p>“It’s been a very challenging task over the last ten years for all of us, not just as banks but as a community, to agree on a common set of standards for SCTs and SDDs,” says Anupam Sinha, EMEA Head of Corporate Payments at Citi, and one of the two representatives of the UK banking community in the Euro Banking Association’s (EBA) discussion on the build-up to SDDs.</p>
<p>“Everybody wanted to have the features specific to their own country included as a part of SDD and SCT, because they were used to it and it was embedded in their country’s payment infrastructure. The challenge was to create the most efficient scheme possible to be run across the community of countries that would be a part of SEPA,” explains Sinha. “As a group of individual communities with the EPC and the EBA, we decided to look at the common services being offered to our customers as the lowest common denominator to achieve a basis for the core SCT and SDD schemes. It was recognised, however, that individual markets were also used to certain local operating flavours which were highly embedded in both the banking infrastructure and the corporate and consumer processes in those markets.”</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote>Despite the innovative and value-adding services already being developed, there is significant scope for further AOS to help corporates in different areas of their payments processing.</blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source"></p>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Sinha says market participants wanted to keep these ‘local flavours’, and this is where the concept of AOS came into being. Each country’s community had to determine whether the core SCT and SDD schemes met the needs of their market participants or if an AOS should be developed. Once implemented, the services would then be offered as a closed user group to all the participants who wanted to be part of that particular service.</p>
<div class="boxed">
<h4 id="aos-innovations">AOS innovations</h4>
<p>While there is a wide range of AOS available (and the list is growing all the time), the selection below gives some idea of how they can help corporates derive greater value from operating in the SEPA environment.</p>
<h4 id="cor1">COR1</h4>
<p>COR1 is an AOS offered by a number of banks for corporates operating in Austria, Germany and Spain. It was created as a response to calls from some corporates that had previously used legacy direct debit processes with a D+1 clearing cycle time. When these companies transitioned to the standard SDD Core process (which has a longer clearing cycle), they faced disruption to their business. With COR1, these companies now have the previous benefits of the shorter DD submission deadline, while still being within the SEPA framework.</p>
<p>This AOS is particularly beneficial to corporates who operate on a cash on collection-type model, enabling them to clear up their credit line faster and better manage their working capital.</p>
<h4 id="aos2">AOS2</h4>
<p>AOS2 is an AOS launched in Finland (one of the first countries to migrate to SCTs) related to payment remittance information. It allows corporates making SCTs to provide additional and more structured remittance information as part of the payment which then flows through the banking and payment network to the beneficiary.</p>
<p>This service helps corporates to further automate their reconciliation process, and has helped deal with the issue of missing or unstructured payment remittance information, which was an issue for the Finnish community before this SEPA AOS was developed.</p>
<h4 id="cai">CAI</h4>
<p>Change Account Information (CAI) is an AOS offered in France through which ordering parties of SCTs and SDDs are notified of any changes to the counterparty’s account information. France’s legacy clearing infrastructure provided a reasonably efficient way of informing users when counterparties had, for example, moved to another bank; under SEPA this method was no longer possible.</p>
<p>Subscribers to the CAI AOS who order payments to obsolete accounts receive a CAI file with both the original account information as well as the new account details in both the BIC and IBAN format. The service can help drive efficiencies in a corporate’s AP/AR process, by reducing the time spent chasing changed account information.</p>
<h4 id="seda">SEDA</h4>
<p>SEPA Electronic Data Alignment (SEDA) is an AOS offered to corporates operating in Italy, whereby corporates can electronically collect mandates from customers, often through a web portal. Electronic mandates were the norm under Italy’s legacy system, and this service allows Italian companies to continue this, rather than having to revert to paper mandates under SEPA, which could cause delays to payments in the country.</p>
<p>This service is especially beneficial to corporates operating in Italy with millions of customers who make regular payments – such as a utility.</p>
<h4 id="sepamail">SEPAmail</h4>
<p>SEPAmail is a multi-faceted project developed by a community of French banks, which allows banking-related information (such as invoices, money orders, and notifications) to be formatted and sent using a secure protocol. Interbank payment service platform STET was asked by SepaMail to be a technical contributor to the project.</p>
<p>The AOS is a means of exchanging information, such as from customer to bank and from bank to bank. This messaging channel facilitates a number of services, such as high-speed account number checking; and giving corporates the ability to send an invoice held in a virtual safe along with payment information within a single formatted message.</p>
<p>“We believe that SEPAmail, as a community-shared AOS, is a good answer to the market needs. It allows banks to deliver different services through a unique portal. It simplifies connection for their customers while offering them a simple management of day-to-day administrative tasks,” says Jean-Pic Berry, CEO at STET.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="aos-rules">AOS rules</h3>
<p>There are certain restrictions on the provision of AOS.</p>
<p>The EPC sets out three principles on the offering of services in the SCT Rulebook:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>All AOS must not compromise interoperability of the Scheme nor create barriers to competition.</h5>
<p>The EPC says any complaints regarding this will be handled by the SEPA Management Committee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>AOS are part of the market space and should be established and evolve based on market needs.</h5>
<p>The EPC has the right to incorporate commonly used AOS features into SEPA based on these market needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>There should be transparency in relation to community AOS.</h5>
<p>The EPC states that details of AOS relating to the use of data elements present in the ISO 20022 XML payment standards should be published on the internet in the local language and in English.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, beyond these principles, there are no further mentions of AOS in the EPC’s rulebook. The Council says this is because the services are generally considered competitive offerings and are therefore outside its scope.</p>
<h3 id="more-options">More options</h3>
<p>Despite the innovative and value-adding services already being developed, there is significant scope for further AOS to help corporates in different areas of their payments processing.</p>
<p>“We are going to see a slew of new services,” says STET’s Jean-Pic Berry. “We need to change the way the banking leg of payments is done, and this has been delayed more than necessary. The way we pay for services over the net needs to be overhauled. And there’s a dire need both in terms of invoicing, particularly the reconciliation between invoicing and payments – here there is a need for basic services that are not provided today. Then there are services related to mobile phones – why can’t these be used for payments more generally?”</p>
<p>He adds that an AOS that provides a consolidated view of banking operations over time could also deliver significant value to some corporates.</p>
<p>Most of the largest banks support a number of AOS. Indeed, it seems it would be unwise to neglect the corporate interest in the area. “If you don’t offer these services, there is a significant risk of losing business,” says Citi’s Sinha.</p>
<p>STET’s Berry believes the question is not which banks will offer services, but will they offer them in a coherent way? “There is a trend towards monopoly in banking, and therefore a need for common answers. There is a natural tendency to have solutions which are easy to transfer from one bank to another,” he comments. This, he believes, will be the key factor in the development of the bank provision of AOS in the near future.</p>
<p>Along with the expanded payment possibilities of SEPA, and the associated AOS, financial risks are also growing very rapidly. A cloud on the SEPA horizon is that it is potentially opening up a new threat that never really existed before.</p>
<p>“There used to be a time when only cards had any significant risk of fraud, when fraud on CTs or DDs was virtually unheard of. Now you’re going to see a much wider area of fraud, which is one of the consequences, unforeseen or at least unwanted, of SEPA. Frauds on SDDs will probably rise significantly, given that you can now order a payment from anywhere in Europe,” says STET’s Berry. But he believes the growing cloud of fraud could have a silver lining, in that a whole range of new services could be developed to address this burgeoning risk.</p>
<h3 id="aos-into-the-mainstream">AOS into the mainstream</h3>
<p>Going forward, Citi’s Sinha would like to see the AOS which have a common applicability achieve a more centralised role within SEPA, so their benefits can be felt more widely.</p>
<p>“For many MNCs, the biggest attraction of SEPA was that they would move to a very harmonised and standardised infrastructure, processes and set of rules. For example, if you’ve got a particular way of handling mandates in Italy, or a particular cycle time in Germany, or a particular way of passing information in Finland, then country-specific AOS are not really providing you with a harmonised process across all the countries,” he says.</p>
<p>“As the adoption of AOS increases, we, as the banking community, along with the regulators, should look at how we can make at least the key AOS, which are adding a lot of value, something that is more a core part of the SEPA service, rather than just being left as an AOS, in a particular community. Over the next two to five years, as the market evolves and we embed SEPA into our processes, we’d like to see these AOS become more mainstream.”</p>
<p>If some of these services do indeed evolve from peripheral, complementary products and gain wider usage among the corporate community, many more companies could then benefit from the innovative solutions now being developed.</p></div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Mobile and online technologies have made rapid progress in the past decade as smartphones have become ubiquitous and broadband communications have been rolled out across the world. Businesses and consumers have come to expect rapid access to information and want to conduct transactions in real, or near real time. These developments have not been matched, however, in the payments space. The majority of financial institutions are burdened with ageing core banking systems and myriad regulatory demands are monopolising resources that might otherwise be diverted to upgrade programmes. The relatively slow clearing cycles in the payments world are coming under scrutiny as consumers and businesses demand more agile systems.</p>
<p>Little surprise, then, that the UK’s Faster Payment Service (FPS) which launched in May 2008 has been watched with international interest – certainly of late. Generally speaking, faster payment schemes enable customers to make electronic payments almost instantaneously, seven days a week, 24 hours a day. The payments are typically made via a phone or internet-enabled device and involve the transfer of money between accounts, to other people, to pay bills or to make regular standing order payments.</p>
<p>Although countries such as Nigeria and Poland also have real-time payments schemes in place already, one jurisdiction in particular is leading the way when it comes to faster payments initiatives, namely Asia Pacific. Let’s take a look at what is happening in the region.</p>
<h3 id="singapore">Singapore</h3>
<p>Singapore’s Immediate Payments G3 scheme was launched in mid-March 2014 and supports credit transfers and direct debits. The scheme focuses on two principal areas: real-time payments (RTP, low-value real-time gross settlement) and bulk payments (automated clearing house). RTP features include payer-to-beneficiary payment completion within five minutes (up to a maximum of SGD 10,000) and payment completion within 15 seconds between participating banks, which are obliged to be able to receive and credit payments on a 24–hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week basis. The Singapore ACH for bulk payments has also been improved to provide support for additional details that will facilitate payment identification and invoice reconciliation.</p>
<p>G3 replaces Singapore’s eGiro payment system that dates back to the 1980s. It will deliver real-time payment processing and automation of direct debit authorisations. The scheme will present operational and technical challenges for member banks, many of which are encumbered with ageing payment processing platforms and core systems. Moving from the eGiro system, member banks will have to update their payment systems to be compliant with ISO 20022 payment messages, real-time service levels, a 24/7 operating environment and provision for multiple clearing and settlement cycles.</p>
<p>The initial phase of the scheme – real-time payments – came into effect on 17<sup>th</sup> March this year. Phase two, which involves bulk payments (G3 Bulk), is due for launch in September or October. The final piece of the jigsaw, an electronic direct debit authorisation (EDDA) system is expected to be rolled out in late 2015.</p>
<p>The direct debit authorisations will be set up and exchanged electronically, leveraging the scheme infrastructure and capabilities to support the adoption of a bulk payment and will benefit real-time debit transactions. It will reduce the turnaround time required to set up an authorisation from the existing 12 to 15 working days to five working days or fewer, depending on the readiness of billing organisations’ banks and the billing organisations themselves. Amendments and termination features will be included as part of the module.</p>
<p>VocaLink, which designed, built and runs the Faster Payments Service in the UK, has partnered with Singapore-based payments solution provider BCSIS, to deliver its Immediate Payments in Singapore as the real-time payments infrastructure for the G3 scheme. There are some differences between the Singapore scheme and that in the UK. Singapore is using the more modern ISO 20022 standard, whereas the UK scheme is based on the ISO 8583 messaging standard.</p>
<p>“A lot of work had to be done to upgrade the VocaLink system to operate on ISO 20022,” says Stephen Peters, a Vice-President at Clear2Pay, which is also involved in the project. “Within G3 the banks participating will have to implement solutions that will interface to the central hub through secure, transparent networks. If they are processing real-time payments they will have to upgrade their core banking systems because many existing systems cannot deal with that flow of real-time payments; they are set up around batch or overnight processes.” Several banks in Singapore are using Clear2Pay’s Open Payments Framework as a module to run the G3 scheme.</p>
<h3 id="india">India</h3>
<p>India is also undergoing significant changes and improvements to its clearing infrastructure. One of the main developments is the Interbank Mobile Payment Service (IMPS, now called the Immediate Payment Service), which is live at nearly 60 banks. Introduced in November 2010 by the National Payments Corporation of India, the service is a mobile remittance solution. It offers an instant, 24/7 interbank electronic fund transfer service through mobile phones. Customers can use mobile handsets or tablets as a channel for accessing their bank accounts. Payments are transferred in a secure way and confirmation is immediately issued.</p>
<p>The IMPS platform processes person-to-person, person-to-account and person-to-merchant remittances. Transactions can be initiated from mobile phones, internet-enabled devices and from ATMs.</p>
<p>Applications of IMPS include the purchase of goods from stores via users’ mobile devices and online purchases via internet-enabled devices. IMPS offers multiple modes of funds transfers for mobile purchases, including a mobile application, SMS and a national, unified unstructured supplementary services data platform. Funds can also be transferred over the internet via accounts registered to IMPS or other accounts, using the Indian Financial System Code. The ATM network is also hosting IMPS payments, enabling funds to be transferred.</p>
<p>A challenge for promoters of IMPS is the patchy nature of mobile coverage across India. The Indian mobile network is relatively slow and is also unreliable. At this stage, IMPS is dependent on a mobile device and on users having bank accounts. According to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), as of December 2013 IMPS payments represented only about 1% of India’s total payments volumes, with only 1.93 million payments made via the scheme in that month, compared with the more than 60 million payments cleared via the National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT).</p>
<p>The RBI says, however, that IMPS has improved the efficiency of mobile banking by enabling real-time transfer of funds between bank accounts and providing a centralised interbank settlement service for mobile banking transactions. The IMPS has also been enhanced to support merchant payments using mobile phones to promote a move towards a cashless society. An option is being considered for mobile merchant payments whereby merchants, on initiating the payment request, complete the transaction by accepting an OTP generated by customers on their mobile phones.</p>
<p>The IMPS initiative has been helped by the Reserve Bank of India’s support and encouragement of electronic payments. The country’s electronic payments systems are being upgraded and there has been significant growth in the use of the two electronic clearing systems, NEFT and RTGS.</p>
<h3 id="australia">Australia</h3>
<p>While developments may have stalled in India, the idea of faster payments has gained more momentum in Australia. A project is underway to modernise the country’s payments system, which to date has been based on bilateral clearing arrangements.</p>
<p>Faster payments will be ushered in on the back of the New Payments Platform (NPP), a new infrastructure for Australia’s low value payments. It will provide businesses and consumers with a fast, versatile, data-rich payments system for making their everyday payments. An industry steering committee is overseeing development of the NPP. Chaired by Paul Lahiff, the New Payments Platform Steering Committee comprises senior representatives from the Australian banking and mutual sector, an alternative payments provider and the Chief Executive of the Australian Payments Clearing Association, Chris Hamilton. The Steering Committee appointed KPMG as programme manager to the project.</p>
<p>The NPP will comprise a basic infrastructure, which all financial institutions, and through them businesses and consumers, connect to. This will enable payments to be made quickly between financial institutions and their customers’ accounts. The system will enable funds to be accessible almost as soon as payment is received – even when the payer and payee have accounts at different financial institutions.</p>
<p>The idea of the NPP is to provide an infrastructure that will support value-added services developed by individual financial institutions. The multi-layered infrastructure has been designed to promote competition and drive innovation in payment services.</p>
<p>The NPP is being developed collaboratively by authorised deposit-taking institutions. A total of 17 institutions are taking part in the programme, including Australia’s ‘big four’ banks: ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank and Westpac. Foreign institutions such as Citi, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, ING and HSBC are also involved. The NPP is the Australian payment industry’s response to the central bank Reserve Bank of Australia’s strategic objectives on payments innovation.</p>
<h3 id="drivers-and-benefits">Drivers and benefits</h3>
<p>While the ability to meet the increasing demand of consumers and businesses for more rapid response times is one driver behind the implementation of faster payment schemes, there are other forces at work. Lahiff says many financial institutions have responded to the desire of consumers for faster or real-time payments, but to date only within their own institution. “The Australian payments market’s move from a bilateral system to a multilateral approach will enable us to make faster payments between banks, rather than just within a financial institution,” he says. A benefit for businesses, particularly small and medium enterprises, will be the ability to have more data accompanying payments.</p>
<p>In a review of innovation in the Australian payments system, published in 2012, the RBA found a demand among both consumers and businesses to make real-time payments. Rather than mandating a specific solution, the RBA has required the payments industry in Australia to meet this demand by the end of 2016.</p>
<p>“The RBA’s view is that faster payments will be good for the Australian economy, because fast money is more efficient money. Consumers and businesses will have more choice to make payments safely,” says Lahiff. “We are trying to provide a fast, versatile, data-rich payment system for making everyday payments.”</p>
<p>Clear2Pay’s Peters agrees with this assessment: “The driving idea behind faster payments initiatives is to increase the velocity of money moving through the economy by accelerating the clearing and settlement of payments. The hope is that once money is cleared by the system it will have a follow-on effect into the general commercial environment. If money is received instantly, goods can be shipped more quickly and the economy speeds up.”</p>
<p>Peters is less sure about the impact faster payments will have on corporates, particularly large organisations. “The operations of large corporates are based on overnight settlement. It is difficult to see at this stage what the long-term effect of faster payments will be on these organisations. Possibly there will be an impact on corporate treasuries’ operations and liquidity requirements. Faster payments may give a clearer, near real-time view of liquidity positions.”</p>
<p>The ultimate success of faster payments schemes will possibly reside with financial institutions; as with the Australian scheme, it will be up to the banks and other organisations to develop new and innovative products and services to complement the faster payments. However, many banks are burdened with ageing core banking systems and upgrading these is costly.</p>
<p>The development of Faster Payments in the UK was a slow burn initially, with banks rolling out the scheme very slowly and to little fanfare. A similar scenario is playing out in Singapore, where the MAS has kept fairly quiet about the G3 project, wanting to ensure the platform is stable before promoting it widely. Many banks in Singapore are adopting a wait-and-see approach, enabling the trailblazers to test the market first.</p>
<p>It is possible that some banks may see more rapid payments as a differentiator for corporate banking services. By enabling Singapore banks and financial institutions to process low value payments in real time, innovative and commercially attractive banking products could be developed to counteract the threat of new market entrants, while minimising settlement risk and offering customers the surety and guarantees of a bank-based payment. By moving money at a higher velocity, the MAS hopes the economy and Singapore’s business community will benefit and will keep Singapore at the forefront of regional payments and set the benchmark for innovation.</p>
<h3 id="the-future-of-faster-payments">The future of faster payments</h3>
<p>Despite the radical introduction of the FPS in the UK, it has taken around five years for the market to gain momentum and be widely recognised. However, proponents of faster payments say schemes can provide a platform for value-added services, improving the efficiency of payments systems and ultimately bringing down costs.</p>
<p>Building on the Faster Payments platform in the UK, Barclays for example, has developed Pingit for corporates, an extension of its retail instant payments solution. Corporates can integrate mobile payments into their multi-channel customer strategies. Barclays says this will enable corporates to improve their cashflow, increase their level of customer engagement and grow their businesses.</p>
<p>Many countries around the world, not just in Asia, are investigating instant payment schemes. The US Federal Reserve Board, for example, is encouraging US banks to introduce faster retail payments as part of a wider effort to modernise the country’s payments infrastructure. As more and more countries look to upgrade their ageing payments infrastructures, faster payments will inevitably become ubiquitous – it just may take more time than proponents would wish.</p></div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Consumers appear more comfortable than ever using their mobile devices as a means of transferring money. Earlier this year in the UK, for example, a retail bank customer used a mobile payment application to put down a deposit on a house, in what is thought to be the first transaction of its kind in the world. The UK is widely recognised as one of the most forward-thinking digital economies, and the country is often one of the first to embrace innovations in payment technology. Developments in the UK are therefore likely to be replicated in other regions in the not-too-distant future.</p>
<p>This preparedness to accept mobile as a means of payment is filtering down to corporates, with banks increasingly offering mobile services to larger corporate clients that allow them to approve payments, check balances and even initiate payments using their mobile handsets. After all, treasury departments are staffed by consumers, and their experience of payment technology in their personal lives (provided it is positive) can influence the technology they introduce into the corporate treasury.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We have seen increased customer demand for mobile payments via the Pingit app and are confident our customers will use both methods to suit their needs.”</p>
<p><cite>Darren Foulds, Mobile Banking and Pingit Product Director, Barclays</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unlike Direct Debits (DD), which pull funds from a bank account, many mobile payment solutions push the payment, effectively transferring control to the payer. Popular examples of applications that work on this basis include Barclays’ Pingit and VocaLink’s Zapp, both of which run via the UK’s Faster Payments system. As more solutions appear on the market, mobile is becoming a hot topic for both corporates and banks.</p>
<h3 id="greater-reach">Greater reach</h3>
<p>At the end of April the UK’s Payments Council – the body responsible for ensuring the smooth running of payment services in the country – will launch its Paym (pronounced “Pay Em”) mobile payments service. The service allows customers of the participating banks to make payments by entering the beneficiary’s mobile number, then confirming their name. The service translates the phone number entered by the initiator into the beneficiary’s sort code and account number, which are securely held on a central database designed and developed by VocaLink.</p>
<p>What marks Paym out from other services is that it is industry-wide, and has the potential to link to every current account in the UK using just a mobile number. “Many of the mobile payment services on offer at the moment suffer, to some extent, from a lack of ubiquitous reach. With lots of them, to receive a mobile payment you’ve got to be part of a club, or an existing customer of the bank,” says Chris Dunne, Payment Services Director at VocaLink. VocaLink operates the infrastructure behind payments in the UK – Dunne describes it as the ‘national grid’ for UK payments.</p>
<p>At launch, the Paym database will already be populated with a large number of accounts. Nine banks and building societies – Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Cumberland Building Society, Danske Bank, Halifax, HSBC, Lloyds Bank, Santander and TSB Bank – will be able to use Paym once it is launched, with a further seven joining later in 2014. The Payments Council says that by the end of the year, nine out of ten current accounts in the UK will be covered by the scheme.</p>
<p>But what will the launch of Paym mean for banks who already have their own mobile payment solutions? Will they be rendered obsolete? Barclays, one of the banks participating in Paym from the launch, says its customers can still use Pingit in conjunction with Paym. “We have seen increased customer demand for mobile payments via the Pingit app and are confident our customers will use both methods to suit their needs,” said Darren Foulds, Barclays Mobile Banking and Pingit Product Director in a statement.</p>
<p>And despite a greater ubiquity of reach provided by services like Paym, mobile payments are unlikely to revolutionise the financial system as we know it. They will just make certain transactions easier.</p>
<h3 id="another-payment-channel">Another payment channel</h3>
<p>Mobile payment solutions are unlikely to turn the treasury function upside down either – at least for the moment. These solutions will, however, add a degree of flexibility as a complement to existing payment channels. “Corporates will continue to use desktop-based banking in the back office for high volume payments, as mobile is not a practical medium for this type of activity. Where it does become practical is when a handful of high value payments need approval while the treasurer or senior payment approver is on the move. The approval workflow lends itself to mobile, and treasurers are very happy to use a mobile to approve payments. The mobile itself is another channel, and the mobile payment is just another payment. In its simplest term, you’re settling to a telephone number instead of a bank account,” says Jon Ashton, Managing Director and Head of eChannels at Barclays.</p>
<p>However, as the medium adapts, it could start benefiting corporates at a much more fundamental level. “While it is just a new channel, it is also a channel that could challenge existing business models and ways of managing cash. It can make treasury processes much more efficient and lean, improve cash handling, and help right down to the working capital level, as money is coming in before it would have with the old way of doing things,” says Mark Wraa-Hansen, Head of MobilePay at Danske Bank, which offers a retail mobile payment application and is currently developing a corporate solution.</p>
<p>It could also transform the way some corporates invoice customers. As an alternative to Direct Debits (DD), invoices with a Quick Response (QR) Code allow mobile payments that are almost instantaneous. Furthermore, these payments have embedded in them a token containing information about the customer and the bill, thus saving the corporate on administration costs, as well as making it easier for the customer to pay. This form of payment could bring particular benefits to regulated utilities in billing customers who are either unable or unwilling to pay by DD.</p>
<p>Indeed, the advantages of the mobile medium are particularly relevant to certain industries – such as the utility example above. But certain regions, too, stand to benefit from mobile payments more than others owing to demographic and infrastructural idiosyncrasies. Africa is one such example.</p>
<h3 id="mobile-africa">Mobile Africa</h3>
<p>Africa is particularly ripe for the growth of mobile payment platforms, with its combination of a large unbanked population and widespread mobile phone usage. In 2010 management consultants McKinsey estimated that 326 million people – 80% of the adult population – in Sub-Saharan Africa were financially unserved. Meanwhile, GSMA, the body that represents the world’s mobile operators, has forecast that there will be 346 million mobile users in the region by 2017.</p>
<p>“Mobile can play a key role in getting access to the massive population in Africa that is currently unbanked, or underbanked, and wholly dependent upon physical cash as a means of payment,” says Jerry Pearce, Head of Product Management and TPS at Standard Bank, which offers mobile payment services to its customers in 12 of the 18 countries in which it operates, including Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa. Mobile banking solutions are an essential part of the new banking ecosystem in the continent,” he adds.</p>
<p>M-Pesa, the Kenyan money transfer system supported by mobile phone operators Safaricom and Vodacom has grown rapidly since its launch in 2007. Roughly $19 billion, equivalent to around 25% of the country’s GNP, is now transferred through the medium. Other applications, such as SnapScan, which allows users to scan codes in retail stores before paying electronically, are also proving popular.</p>
<p>As is the case in other regions, mobile payment proliferation for retail customers is driving demand for corporate solutions. Mobile payment solutions also present opportunities to development and charitable organisations as a safer and more efficient way of remitting funds. The potential benefits of the new channel to individuals, corporates and development organisations alike in Africa are clear. “We’ve seen cases where companies and organisations have previously had to ship large quantities of physical cash to remote rural locations, which carries significant associated costs and risks. Now this can be done in real time through a mobile service,” says Pearce.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“From our research, it’s very clear that people are much more likely to use a mobile payment application, if it is provided by their bank rather than a third party, because they trust their bank, they trust their banking application, they’ve had to go through the setup, and they know it’s secure.”</p>
<p><cite>Chris Dunne, Payment Services Director, VocaLink</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pearce also thinks the spread of mobile payment technology in Africa could be replicated in other parts of the world where there is a similar financial and mobile ecosystem. He highlights Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam as examples of countries with low levels of bank accounts and high mobile usage.</p>
<h3 id="embedded-trust">Embedded trust</h3>
<p>Mobile payment applications represent something of an architectural shift from what is used for web-based payment applications. This has posed new challenges in securing the solutions. “With the web model, you had a browser and some HTML code, but the bulk of the logic was on the back-end server. And that’s really the way mobile started as well, the first generation of mobile applications were effectively just web browser applications on your mobile device,” says Vince Arneja, Vice President, Product Management at Arxan Technologies, an application security group whose security is “baked in” to some of the leading mobile payment solutions.</p>
<p>But recent mobile payment applications have progressed to the point where a large part of the functionality is now running on the device itself. “Now the application has effectively become a target because it doesn’t hide behind a firewall any more where trust is embedded in the firewall layer; the trust has to be embedded into the application itself,” he adds.</p>
<p>Users are much more willing to put their trust in a brand they know. “From our research, it’s very clear that people are much more likely to use a mobile payment application, if it is provided by their bank rather than a third party, because they trust their bank, they trust their banking application, they’ve had to go through the setup, and they know it’s secure,” says VocaLink’s Dunne.</p>
<p>For example, Zapp, a real-time mobile payment solution and VocaLink subsidiary, is delivered through the user’s mobile banking application, and utilises the bank’s existing mobile security channel. This provides the twofold benefit of securing the solution using safeguards that are tried and tested, and gaining the trust of the user via their existing relationship with the bank.</p>
<h3 id="security-challenges">Security challenges</h3>
<p>In terms of the specific security threats facing mobile payment applications, one of the biggest is that of reverse engineering, where hackers repackage mobile applications after inserting malicious code and redistribute the application on secondary application stores online. The risk is that users will download these applications assuming that they are official bank products, only for the fraudsters to syphon funds from the account using the malware they had previously introduced. Arneja says several large banks have already approached secondary vendors in order to have reverse-engineered software taken down, to protect their customers, and to prevent damage to the bank’s brand.</p>
<p>Another risk with mobile payment solutions is that of non-repudiation, as it can be difficult to categorically identify the person who has entered or approved a payment. Some solutions turn the device itself into a security token, but in the absence of a smart card and reader – which are generally considered too unwieldy for mobile payments – this remains a challenge in the space.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“New handsets and tablets are coming out every day and the processing capabilities of these devices are exponentially growing at a pace even faster than laptops and desktops; on top of this, the wireless connection speed available on mobile handsets is comparable to that of fibre optic connections.”</p>
<p><cite>Milton Santiago, Global eCommerce Executive, Bank of America Merrill Lynch</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>An extra dimension of security that some banks have started using behind their mobile payment firewalls is forward profiling, which is particularly used for higher value payments. This involves the monitoring of transactions for patterns, and highlighting outliers that do not correlate with the others. “We have historical data where we can compare the types of payment that have been approved in the past, with what is approved on a mobile device, so we can identify if there are any differences in the payment patterns that we’re seeing that get approved through both channels,” says Cindy Murray, Head of Global Treasury Product Platforms and eChannels at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>
<h3 id="trade-off">Trade-off</h3>
<p>As with any payment method, there is a trade-off between security and usability, and this can be a difficult balance to strike. In the retail space, mobile PINs range from five to ten digits. “Long PINs are very cumbersome to enter on a mobile device, and the chances of getting it wrong and disrupting the transaction are very high. It’s a question of playing off the simplicity of the workflow against elements of security. At the moment we’re trying to get a proposition in place that is both secure and easy to use, and we’re very cognisant of the balance to be struck there,” says Ashton.</p>
<p>Danske Bank’s Wraa-Hansen agrees that the security-usability trade-off is a difficult call, but counters that mobile is not a riskier medium per se. “You could make the most secure mobile payment solution in the world, but it would probably be so complex that no one would use it. A lot of the concerns come down to perception; some people just have not realised yet that mobile payments are not inherently riskier than other methods. Security is always a hot topic around new technologies, and this concern will die down,” he adds.</p>
<p>Wraa-Hansen also believes human error – akin to ‘fat finger’ trading mistakes – is perhaps even more of a risk than fraud, and that solution providers should address this by making applications as simple and user-friendly as possible.</p>
<h3 id="mobile-future">Mobile future</h3>
<p>In the future, the usage of mobile payment solutions is likely to evolve in line with new developments in the devices themselves. “New handsets and tablets are coming out every day and the processing capabilities of these devices are exponentially growing at a pace even faster than laptops and desktops; on top of this, the wireless connection speed available on mobile handsets is comparable to that of fibre optic connections. Allied to these technological changes, we’re going to see a richer, more intelligent, and more predictive experience coming from these solutions,” says Milton Santiago, Global eCommerce Executive at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>He also believes the ownership of identity, which currently resides with the banks under the existing mobile security model, could shift to clients, as a result of disruptive mobile technologies devised by the likes of Apple and Samsung. “The integration of biometric security into mobile devices could have a similar effect on mobile payments to what smart card technology had on online payment solutions, significantly impacting how authorisation and authentication take place,” he adds.</p>
<p>According to Arxan’s Arneja, as mobile payment solutions evolve, so will the security behind them: “Mobile security is effectively where internet security was in 2003. It’s very, very early in the space. A lot of effort in enterprises right now is simply being directed to device management. But mobile security will inevitably mature, as it has for web.”</p>
<p>And while mobile payment solutions may not have revolutionised the way corporates make their payments just yet, they should ultimately become part of the standard suite of services banks offer corporate clients. “It’s a new channel and it’s evolving fast. This is not going to happen overnight, but certainly over time it will be expected of banks to include mobile capabilities in their end-to-end payment solutions,” says BofAML’s Murray.</p>
<p>In summary, the mobile payment solutions currently available have the potential to make certain tasks quicker and easier for treasurers. One of the most obvious examples of this is the ability to approve high value payments on the move. But it is only as the use of mobile payments across the supply chain becomes much more widespread that the medium will have a more profound effect on the treasury function and begin to have a material impact on corporates’ working capital.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><i>Increasing numbers of corporates are setting up payments factories as a way of replacing labour-intensive, repetitive payments processes with more capital-intensive, centralised ones. And with greater connectivity to SWIFT and the implementation of SEPA, this trend towards the ‘industrialisation’ of payments processes looks set to continue.</i></p>
<p>Payments factories have been around for about a decade, and to date they have been adopted mainly by very large corporates. But now two forces are driving increasing interest in payments factories: connectivity to the SWIFT financial messaging system and the implementation of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA).</p>
<p>Definitions of a payments factory vary, but the common theme is that it centralises payment processing. Greenwich Treasury Advisers defines a payments factory as a process whereby a multinational corporation’s accounts payable (AP) centre sends disbursement files in a uniform format to a global bank for payments. These payments can be in-country, cross-border, in cheque or any electronic wire form, and involve local and foreign currency. The global bank then converts the cheques to automated clearing house (ACH) payments, cross-border wires to ACH, or converts the payments into a single large FX transaction rather than many small ones.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank says the idea behind a payments factory is to ‘industrialise’ labour-intensive, repetitive processes and replace them with more capital-intensive, centralised ones. However, whereas the goals are similar, a shared service centre (SSC) has the broadest scope, while a payments factory has the narrowest. Deutsche Bank defines payments factories as SSCs that are focused on the accounts payable function. Often, they are part of an in-house bank. The goal is to simplify and automate accounts payable, which is “an ideal candidate for centralisation”, says Deutsche Bank, because invoice receipt and processing are often paper-based and labour-intensive processes. Likewise, collections factories are centralised collections processing centres that are focused on the accounts receivable (AR) function. Most definitions of payments factories would also include collections within the remit of the factory.</p>
<p>Citi identifies two different definitions of payment factories. One describes a payments factory as the result of fully centralising both AP processes and staff into a single location (as within a SSC). On the other hand, some organisations would consider a payments factory to be a centralised hub, solely responsible for the execution of payments to banking partners and facilitated by decentralised accounts payable processes.</p>
<p>“For most corporates, a payments factory involves payment centralisation, moving to a single platform to manage all accounts payable and treasury payments across the organisation,” says Andrew Owens, Senior Vice-President, enterprise payments and payments factory expert at SunGard. “A payments factory is a way to replace multiple electronic banking systems with a single solution. It brings a level of visibility that companies don’t have with existing electronic banking systems.”</p>
<p>On a more granular level, Owens differentiates between payment hubs and payment factories: “The difference between the two is how payments are treated as they flow through the system. If a corporate wants to just have a standard workflow that validates payments and acts as a consolidation and bank connectivity layer, that is a hub. A factory goes further and tends to be more sophisticated, touching payments as they go through, by, for example, enriching them with back office data such as instructions for the bank, warehousing payments and also intelligently routing payments to the most cost-effective channel.” A payments factory is tied to improved cash management and enables treasurers to manage payments that are not related to treasury accounts.</p>
<h3 id="why-a-payments-factory">Why a payments factory?</h3>
<p>A payments factory will provide a number of benefits to corporations. One of the most important in the ongoing environment of cost cutting, is lower costs. A payments factory enables rationalisation of bank relationships and accounts and therefore lowers costs and fees. For example, a payments factory will enable a corporation to net payments and FX transactions for the same suppliers in different locations, considerably reducing external bank costs.</p>
<p>Additionally, by centralising payment activities a corporation can reduce its internal headcount and IT costs. For example, a single payments platform will require less IT attention than multiple electronic banking systems with myriad interfaces. By centralising processes, payments factories deliver improved liquidity management and simpler, more visible cash positions. A corporate treasurer will gain better visibility as to who is making payments within the organisation. This improved visibility will also enable treasurers to optimise liquidity management as they have better control of funding arrangements. Centralisation also improves the quality and speed of payments processing and streamlines account reconciliation. Harmonised payment and collection processes and procedures are another benefit, along with fewer IT interfaces and file formats. Finally, risks can be reduced because internal controls can be strengthened and IT security is also increased.</p>
<p>SunGard’s Owens defines the benefits of payments factories as ‘hard’ or ‘soft’ returns on investment. A hard return includes savings made from decommissioning e-banking infrastructure and bank connectivity systems. There are also savings to be made from fewer errors that in turn lead to reduced bank charges because the corporate is not attracting payment repair fees. A soft return could be the value derived from gaining an earlier and more accurate daily cash position.</p>
<h3 id="who-should-build-a-factory">Who should build a factory?</h3>
<p>Payments factories are a part of the “very visible trend” towards centralisation of treasury activities, says Paul Stheeman, independent treasury executive and consultant, based in Germany. “Payment factories are suited to lower-value treasury activities such as making or collecting payments, particularly for large companies or those that deal with many payments of low value.”</p>
<p>Most of the pioneers of payments factories were very large corporations, seeking reduced costs and more efficient treasury processes. A decision to implement a payments factory will be influenced by a number of factors, including the nature of the business, its trading model, the location of the buyers and suppliers with whom the company interacts, the bank relationships and the extent of existing centralisation of processes, operating currencies, bank connectivity and services, and the status of the corporation’s IT and ERP systems. For this reason, each corporate will be assessing whether or not to set up a payments factory from a different viewpoint.</p>
<p>Owens says payments factories are most suited to companies with at least $5 billion in revenues. Such companies have relationships with many banks, and the rationalisation that a payments factory project brings will result in a good return on investment. Stheeman agrees that the largest companies will reap the most benefit from a payments factory exercise but that should not preclude medium-sized companies from considering such an approach.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-start">How to start</h3>
<p>The best way to initiate a payments factory project is to assess the company’s cash visibility, says Marcus Hughes, Director of Business Development at Bottomline Technologies. “By looking at where money is in the company – even money in accounts that are outside of treasury – a company will get a better handle on cash and will be able to manage working capital more efficiently.”</p>
<p>Improving cash visibility can deliver big rewards; one company Bottomline worked with found £20m in hidden cash, which more than paid for the payments factory project. Once a company has assessed its cash visibility it should then consider the impact on payments processes.</p>
<p>The chief financial officer should initiate a project, appointing the treasurer in a key implementation role. Procurement, AP and AR, supply chain management along with IT, legal and tax personnel should all be involved at some stage. It is also important to get the support of subsidiaries in other countries. Subsidiaries typically deal with one or two banks in the country via e-banking systems and may struggle to understand the value of moving to a payments factory. Explaining the bigger picture across the entire company in terms of the cost savings and efficiencies that will be gained from a payments factory should help to bring staff on board.</p>
<p>Around 90% of companies implementing a payments factory will be doing so for the first time, says Owens. For this reason, they should seriously consider engaging a speciality payments consultancy to gain the required expertise. Without this external input companies may be in danger of developing a payments factory that is based on outmoded AP/AR processes and formats. A successful payments factory will ensure that a company’s payments processes are future-proofed.</p>
<p>Citi says there are important questions that need to be asked at the set up phase of a payments factory project. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How are payments processed today?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many banks are providing payment services?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does communication take place with these providers?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the core currencies for the organisation?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are incoming collections funding payments activities?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there visibility and control across payment activities?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How efficient is the funding process?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where is working capital trapped?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The structure of a payments factory will depend on a company’s existing payment set up and future cash management strategy. Companies with decentralised, multi-banked environments will typically focus on control, visibility and standardisation of payment flows. This can be achieved with a shared banking application or a system that facilitates the receipt of instructions from business units and creates payment files for onward delivery to banking partners. All external payments are sent and all bank statements are received through a single delivery channel.</p>
<p>Companies with centralised payments processing will be more focused on achieving further process efficiencies through improving straight through processing (STP) rates, improving funding efficiency and automating processes. These companies, says Citi, will also look to build structures such as in-house banks, netting, and payment-on-behalf-of (POBO) structures to facilitate inter-company activities, manage cash positions and aggregate payment obligations.</p>
<p>Citi says there are a number of factors companies should consider when setting their priorities for a payments factory. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Scope</h5>
<p>– the locations of the business units and the processes, staff numbers and inter-company activity to be covered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Banking strategy</h5>
<p>– preferred number of payments processing partners, bank capabilities and requirements for local account services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Liquidity management</h5>
<p>– currencies, preferred account structures and locations, funding arrangements, aggregation of liabilities and business unit control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Connectivity and file formats</h5>
<p>– preferred method of bank communication, relative importance of bank agnostic channels and formats such as ISO 20022 XML.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Internal readiness to support changes in processes</h5>
<p>– the changes in technology that are required, the ability to support changes in desired timelines, conflicting projects, cultural hurdles such as local business unit autonomy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Legal and tax</h5>
<p>– any changes to account structures, tax implications, reporting requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="swift-connectivity">SWIFT connectivity</h3>
<p>Many payments factory projects are run in parallel with SWIFT onboarding projects. Corporate interest in connecting to the network run by the Brussels-based financial messaging co-operative has grown. Nearly 900 corporates, representing 25,000 separate entities, are registered on the SWIFT network, which offers users standardised connectivity to SWIFT’s member banks, of which there are currently more than 9,000 in 200 countries.</p>
<p>The benefits of SWIFT connectivity are closely related to the goals of payments factory projects. SWIFT:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enables corporates to gain global visibility on cash, receiving end-of-day or intraday reporting directly from all banks in a standard format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lowers financial transaction costs by enabling channel rationalisation and higher STP rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enables treasurers to control payment initiations and increase security.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-sepa-influence">The SEPA influence</h3>
<p>In Europe, SEPA has driven many payments factory projects. At the most sophisticated level, corporates are looking to leverage the investments they have already made in complying with SEPA to set up a factory that can handle inter-company payments linked to an in-house bank and payments-on-behalf-of (POBO) and collections-on-behalf-of (COBO).</p>
<p>SEPA instruments contain fields for POBO and COBO transactions. SEPA is a significant enabler in the passing of information through to the end client, helping corporations and their suppliers to reconcile payments more efficiently and quickly. It is driving a big push towards POBO in Europe, and some North American corporations are establishing POBO structures initially in Europe because SEPA helps them to do this easily.</p>
<p>Owens says SEPA has triggered payments factory projects, particularly as the initial migration deadline of February 2014 has now passed (although a six-month extension has been allowed for financial institutions and companies to become compliant). “Those companies with existing payments factories found SEPA easier to implement because they had more efficient processes and fewer bank interfaces and relationships,” he says. With the deadline having passed, many of the corporates who had taken an initial tactical approach to SEPA are revisiting it and looking to capitalise on the ability to reduce their bank account burden, Eurozone footprint, and implement POBO schemes. SEPA is an enabler of all of these capabilities, says Owens.</p>
<h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>
<p>A payments factory project is not for the faint-hearted. While not necessarily costly in terms of cash, such projects can be very time-consuming.</p>
<p>Stheeman says one of the main deterrents for corporates setting up a payments factory is the time-consuming nature of such projects. Not only do internal staff need to be deployed, but a company must also include third parties, such as banks and software providers, in the project. Depending on the scope of a payments factory project, this can take a lot of time.</p>
<p>Resistance from subsidiaries is also a challenge. Bottomline’s Hughes says companies must be careful to segregate duties within a payments factory in order to establish audit trails. “For political reasons, it is often helpful if some of the responsibility remains with local units. Some organisations realise that local people’s expertise is important and they need to know what is going on. Finance professionals in local subsidiaries play a key role in cash forecasting.” Companies should allow them to initiate some of the payments, while the higher value payments should come under the remit of the treasurer in the payments factory.</p>
<h3 id="outcomes">Outcomes</h3>
<p>Some companies are now undertaking payments factory replacement projects – a sign of the maturity of the industry, says SunGard’s Owens. Early adopters have now had factories in place for around a decade and are refreshing their set-up in order to gain new functionalities.</p>
<p>For example, in 1998 Philips’s treasury introduced the Philips Payment Factory (PPF). The model for the PPF had been based on a bank-styled inter-company current account that could be used for initiating POBO. The PPF operated accounts in 25 countries and 15 different currencies.</p>
<p>Despite the many benefits, the PPF did not work for all subsidiaries and payment methods so Philips maintained a separate global cash management and payment processing infrastructure. To remedy this, the company implemented the Next Generation Philips Payment Factory (NGPPF) project, with SAP, BBP (a SWIFT service bureau), consultancy Zanders, and bank partners Citi and Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The new platform delivered visibility on all bank balances, control over bank account infrastructure, transparency on local payment processes, more accurate information on trade credit, and improved ability to spin off or integrate new businesses.</p>
<p>Global pharmaceutical company UCB implemented a payments factory to move away from a costly structure based on separate in-country payment teams. One of the key goals of the project was to establish POBO capabilities that would enable the central treasury team to make payments for their subsidiaries, eliminating the need for business units to hold foreign currency accounts. With a payments factory, UCB was able to rationalise its cash management structures and banking systems, standardise formats and achieve greater economies of scale.</p>
<p>T-Mobile uses SWIFT as its messaging platform to support an in-house bank and payments and collections factory, processing payments and statements for its European subsidiaries. Before it moved on to SWIFT the mobile operator had its own bank interfaces and formats across four countries, with a total of 15 different systems in place. The costs of operating and maintaining the interfaces were very high and the company also found it difficult to control its payments flows. T-Mobile has estimated the net benefits of its move to SWIFT to be about €4.5m over five years (it connected to Swift in 2007) and a financial return on investment of 182%.</p></div>

<p>Until now, SEPA has been viewed largely as a compliance project. But with the official migration deadline now behind us, and the six month transition period underway, it is time for corporate treasurers to look beyond mere compliance to the major efficiency opportunities that SEPA offers.</p>
<p>One of the most significant of these is the ability to centralise multi-currency payables and receivables. By establishing a payment &amp; collection factory that can execute and process transactions on behalf of multiple subsidiaries, organisations can capture significant process and working capital improvements.</p>
<p>This webinar looks at using SEPA as a springboard to streamline accounts receivable and accounts payable and provides tips on best practice implementation. There will also be practical advice on how to improve visibility and cash management with automated cash forecasting, sweeping and pooling.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Mobile and online technologies have made rapid progress in the past decade as smartphones have become ubiquitous and broadband communications have been rolled out across the world. Businesses and consumers have come to expect rapid access to information and want to conduct transactions in real, or near real, time.</p>
<p>These developments have not been matched, however, in the payments space. The majority of financial institutions are burdened with ageing core banking systems and myriad regulatory demands are monopolising resources that might otherwise be diverted to upgrade programmes. The relatively slow clearing cycles in the payments world are coming under scrutiny as consumers and businesses demand more agile systems.</p>
<p>Across the Asia Pacific region, initiatives are under way to implement faster, or immediate, payment systems. Generally, faster payment schemes enable customers to make electronic payments almost instantaneously, seven days a week, 24 hours a day. The payments are typically made via a phone or internet-enabled device and involve the transfer of money between accounts, to other people, to pay bills or to make regular standing order payments. Some initiatives are based on, or have taken inspiration from, the UK’s Faster Payments scheme, which was launched in May 2008 and by November 2013 had processed its three billionth payment.</p>
<h3 id="singapore">Singapore</h3>
<p>Singapore’s Immediate Payments G3 scheme will be launched in mid-March 2014. The scheme supports credit transfers and direct debits. It focuses on two principal areas: real-time payments (RTP, low-value real-time gross settlement) and bulk payments (automated clearing house). RTP features include payer-to-beneficiary payment completion within five minutes (up to a maximum of SGD 10,000) and payment completion within 15 seconds between participating banks, which are obliged to be able to receive and credit payments on a 24–hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week basis. The Singapore ACH for bulk payments has also been improved to provide support for additional details that will facilitate payment identification and invoice reconciliation.</p>
<p>G3 replaces Singapore’s eGiro payment system that dates back to the 1980s. It will deliver real-time payment processing and automation of direct debit authorisations. The scheme will present operational and technical challenges for member banks, many of which are encumbered with ageing payment processing platforms and core systems. Moving from the eGiro system, member banks will have to update their payment systems to be compliant with ISO 20022 payment messages, real-time service levels, a 24/7 operating environment and provision for multiple clearing and settlement cycles.</p>
<p>The initial phase of the scheme – real-time payments – will come into effect on 17<sup>th</sup> March this year. Phase two, which involves bulk payments (G3 Bulk), is due for launch in September or October. The final piece of the jigsaw, an electronic direct debit authorisation (EDDA) system is expected to be rolled out in late 2015.</p>
<p>The direct debit authorisations will be set up and exchanged electronically, leveraging the scheme infrastructure and capabilities to support the adoption of a bulk payment and will benefit real-time debit transactions. It will reduce the turnaround time required to set up an authorisation from the existing 12 to 15 working days to five working days or fewer, depending on the readiness of billing organisations’ banks and the billing organisations themselves. Amendments and termination features will be included as part of the module.</p>
<p>VocaLink, which designed, built and runs the Faster Payments Service in the UK, has partnered with Singapore-based payments solution provider BCSIS, to deliver its Immediate Payments in Singapore as the real-time payments infrastructure for the G3 scheme. There are some differences between the Singapore scheme and that in the UK. Singapore is using the more modern ISO 20022 standard, whereas the UK scheme is based on the ISO 8583 messaging standard.</p>
<p>“A lot of work had to be done to upgrade the VocaLink system to operate on ISO 20022,” says Stephen Peters, a vice-president at Clear2Pay, which is also involved in the project. “Within G3 the banks participating will have to implement solutions that will interface to the central hub through secure, transparent networks. If they are processing real-time payments they will have to upgrade their core banking systems because many existing systems cannot deal with that flow of real-time payments; they are set up around batch or overnight processes.” Several banks in Singapore are using Clear2Pay’s Open Payments Framework as a module to run the G3 scheme.</p>
<h3 id="india">India</h3>
<p>India is undergoing significant changes and improvements to its clearing infrastructure. One of the main developments is the Interbank Mobile Payment Service (IMPS, now called the Immediate Payment Service), which is live at nearly 60 banks. Introduced in November 2010 by the National Payments Corporation of India, the service is a mobile remittance solution. It offers an instant, 24/7 inter-bank electronic fund transfer service through mobile phones. Customers can use mobile handsets or tablets as a channel for accessing their bank accounts. Payments are transferred in a secure way and confirmation is immediately issued.</p>
<p>The IMPS platform processes person-to-person, person-to-account and person-to-merchant remittances. Transactions can be initiated from mobile phones, internet-enabled devices and from ATMs.</p>
<p>Applications of IMPS include the purchase of goods from stores via users’ mobile devices and online purchases via internet-enabled devices. IMPS offers multiple modes of funds transfers for mobile purchases, including a mobile application, SMS and a national, unified unstructured supplementary services data platform. Funds also can be transferred over the internet via accounts registered to IMPS or other accounts, using the Indian Financial System Code. The ATM network is also hosting IMPS payments, enabling funds to be transferred. Read more about the benefits of IMPS for corporates on page 32 of this issue, where David Blair, former vice-president treasury at Huawei, now Treasury Consultant at Acarate, gives his views on the progress being made.</p>
<p>A challenge for promoters of IMPS is the patchy nature of mobile coverage across India. The Indian mobile network is relatively slow and is also unreliable. At this stage, IMPS is dependent on a mobile device and on users having bank accounts. According to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), as of December 2013 IMPS payments represented only about 1% of India’s total payments volumes, with only 1.93 million payments made via the scheme in that month, compared with more than 60 million payments cleared via the National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT).</p>
<p>The RBI says, however, that IMPS has improved the efficiency of mobile banking by enabling real-time transfer of funds between bank accounts and providing a centralised inter-bank settlement service for mobile banking transactions. The IMPS has also been enhanced to support merchant payments using mobile phones to promote a move towards a cashless society. An option is being considered for mobile merchant payments whereby merchants, on initiating the payment request, complete the transaction by accepting an OTP generated by customers on their mobile phones.</p>
<p>The IMPS initiative has been helped by the Reserve Bank of India’s support and encouragement of electronic payments. The country’s electronic payments systems are being upgraded and there has been significant growth in the use of the two electronic clearing systems, NEFT and RTGS.</p>
<h3 id="australia">Australia</h3>
<p>While developments may have stalled in India, the idea of faster payments has gained more momentum in Australia. A project is under way to modernise the country’s payments system, which to date has been based on bilateral clearing arrangements.</p>
<p>Faster payments will be ushered in on the back of the New Payments Platform (NPP), a new infrastructure for Australia’s low value payments. It will provide businesses and consumers with a fast, versatile, data-rich payments system for making their everyday payments.</p>
<p>An industry steering committee is overseeing development of the NPP. Chaired by Paul Lahiff, the New Payments Platform Steering Committee comprises senior representatives from the Australian banking and mutual sector, an alternative payments provider and the Chief Executive of the Australian Payments Clearing Association, Chris Hamilton. The Steering Committee appointed KPMG as programme manager to the project.</p>
<p>The NPP will comprise a basic infrastructure, which all financial institutions, and through them businesses and consumers, connect to. This will enable payments to be made quickly between financial institutions and their customers’ accounts. The system will enable funds to be accessible almost as soon as payment is received – even when the payer and payee have accounts at different financial institutions.</p>
<p>The idea of the NPP is to provide an infrastructure that will support value-added services developed by individual financial institutions. The multi-layered infrastructure has been designed to promote competition and drive innovation in payment services. “Everyone will connect to the basic infrastructure and then individual financial institutions will be free to come up with products and services to offer their customers,” says Lahiff. “As long as the integrity of the basic infrastructure remains intact, FIs can develop services that we hope will make for a more competitive, better payments environment.”</p>
<p>The NPP is being developed collaboratively by authorised deposit-taking institutions. A total of 17 institutions are taking part in the programme, including Australia’s ‘big four’ banks: ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank and Westpac. Foreign institutions such as Citi, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, ING and HSBC are also involved. The NPP is the Australian payment industry’s response to the central bank Reserve Bank of Australia’s strategic objectives on payments innovation.</p>
<h3 id="drivers-and-benefits">Drivers and benefits</h3>
<p>While the ability to meet the increasing demand of consumers and businesses for more rapid response times is one driver behind the implementation of faster payment schemes, there are other forces at work. Lahiff says many financial institutions have responded to the desire of consumers for faster or real-time payments, but to date only within their own institution. “The Australian payments market’s move from a bilateral system to a multilateral approach will enable us to make faster payments between banks, rather than just within a financial institution,” he says. A benefit for businesses, particularly small and medium enterprises, will be the ability to have more data accompanying payments.</p>
<p>In a review of innovation in the Australian payments system, published in 2012, the RBA found a demand among both consumers and businesses to make real-time payments. Rather than mandating a specific solution, the RBA has required the payments industry in Australia to meet this demand by the end of 2016.</p>
<p>“The RBA’s view is that faster payments will be good for the Australian economy, because fast money is more efficient money. Consumers and businesses will have more choice to make payments safely,” says Lahiff. “We are trying to provide a fast, versatile, data-rich payment system for making everyday payments.”</p>
<p>Clear2Pay’s Peters agrees with this assessment: “The driving idea behind faster payments initiatives is to increase the velocity of money moving through the economy by accelerating the clearing and settlement of payments. The hope is that once money is cleared by the system it will have a follow-on effect into the general commercial environment. If money is received instantly, goods can be shipped more quickly and the economy speeds up.”</p>
<p>Peters is less sure about the impact faster payments will have on corporates, particularly large organisations. “The operations of large corporates are based on overnight settlement. It is difficult to see at this stage what the long-term effect of faster payments will be on these organisations. Possibly there will be an impact on corporate treasuries’ operations and liquidity requirements. Faster payments may give a clearer, near real-time view of liquidity positions.”</p>
<p>The ultimate success of faster payments schemes will possibly reside with financial institutions; as with the Australian scheme, it will be up to the banks and other organisations to develop new and innovative products and services to complement the faster payments. However, many banks are burdened with ageing core banking systems and upgrading these is costly. The development of faster payments in the UK was a slow burn, with banks rolling out the scheme very slowly and to little fanfare.</p>
<p>A similar scenario is playing out in Singapore, where the MAS has kept fairly quiet about the G3 project, wanting to ensure the platform is stable before promoting it widely. Many banks in Singapore are adopting a wait-and-see approach, enabling the trailblazers to test the market first. It is possible that some banks may see more rapid payments as a differentiator for corporate banking services.</p>
<p>By enabling Singapore’s banks and financial institutions to process low value payments in real time, innovative and commercially attractive banking products could be developed to counteract the threat of new market entrants, while minimising settlement risk and offering customers the surety and guarantees of a bank-based payment. By moving money at a higher velocity, the MAS hopes the economy and Singapore’s business community will benefit, keeping Singapore at the forefront of regional payments and setting the benchmark for innovation.</p>
<h3 id="the-future-of-faster-payments">The future of faster payments</h3>
<p>Proponents of faster payments say schemes can provide a platform for value-added services, improving the efficiency of payments systems and ultimately bringing down costs. Faster payments initiatives are not short-term money making ventures, as has been proved in the UK where it has taken around five years for the market to gain momentum.</p>
<p>Building on the faster payments platform in the UK, Barclays for example, has developed Pingit for corporates, an extension of its retail instant payments solution. Corporates can integrate mobile payments into their multi-channel customer strategies. Barclays says this will enable corporates to improve their cash flow, increase their level of customer engagement and grow their businesses.</p>
<p>Many countries around the world are investigating instant payment schemes. The US Federal Reserve Board is encouraging US banks to introduce faster retail payments as part of a wider effort to modernise the country’s payments infrastructure. As more and more countries look to upgrade their ageing payments infrastructures, faster payments will inevitably become ubiquitous – it just may take more time than proponents would wish.</p></div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><i>All businesses are exposed to market risk of some form. A common response is to hedge against those risks but in accounting terms this can create undesirable P&amp;L volatility. Hedge accounting may be an effective remedy to this problem, but it can be a demanding process. Treasury Today calls upon a number of experts to shed some light on this dark art.</i></p>
<p>As deep and mysterious topics go, one of the clear leaders of the pack in financial circles is hedge accounting. It can strike fear into the heart of even the most seasoned finance professional. But, notwithstanding its complexities, it can be an effective means of mitigating the risk of potentially damaging volatility in profit and loss (P&amp;L) accounts caused by the mark-to-market fluctuation of a hedging instrument and allowing a better reflection of economic performance to be provided. It is a voluntary accounting process (it has been described as a privilege, not a right) but for those that use it – typically listed companies whose accounts are exposed to public scrutiny – it must be applied with precision.</p>
<p>So what is it? A business may hedge financial or non-financial assets or liabilities by using a financial instrument in order to manage its exposure to a risk it may have around interest rate, FX, equity, credit or commodity price, for example. Accounting requirements often insist that assets/liabilities (frequently recorded at amortised cost or as a forecast item not yet recognised on the balance sheet) and the instrument used to hedge (which is accounted for as a trading instrument at its market valuation – in other words ‘fair value’ recognised in the P&amp;L account) are accounted for differently. But where differences in measurement arise, such as between the fair value measurement of the hedge and the amortised cost for the assets/liabilities, a mismatch in the valuation or timing of income statement recognition is created, giving the appearance of corporate earnings volatility, which does not provide useful information to investors and shareholders.</p>
<p>Enter hedge accounting, which can be used as a means of reflecting the relationship between an asset/liability and the associated hedging instrument (for example by re-measuring the asset/liability for the hedged risk and recognising that value change in P&amp;L to provide an offsetting effect with the measurement in P&amp;L of the hedging instrument).</p>
<p>As long as the hedge is fully effective (more on this later) most mismatches in the P&amp;L should be evened out by the relationship between the two and thus the business can better depict its performance through its financial statements.</p>
<h3 id="accounting-bodies">Accounting bodies</h3>
<p>Hedge accounting has a strict set of rules and requirements. These are typically laid out in the standardised accounting guidelines of each jurisdiction known as ‘generally accepted accounting principles’ (GAAP). In Singapore, for example, it is the Accounting Standards Committee (ASC) that is in charge of standard setting. In the US, hedge accounting under GAAP is tackled by the country’s Financial Accounting Standards Board FAS 133 rule-set (now known as ASC 815).</p>
<p>When hedging structures are complex, there may be judgements to make where the local accounting standards “do not necessarily address all the possible scenarios”, according to Yann Umbricht, Partner and Treasury UK Leader at PwC. He adds that for listed companies accounting at group level, alongside appropriate local GAAP reporting requirements for individual entities, international accounting standards must normally be applied. In this respect, the IFRS Foundation was established to develop and promote a single set of globally accepted accounting principles (known as International Financial Reporting Standards or IFRS). It works through its independent standard-setting body, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and has global influence. Members of the IASB are responsible for the development and publication of IFRS, which is applied in over 100 countries, including two-thirds of the G20.</p>
<p>Hedge accounting requirements are contained in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, much of which had its genesis in similar requirements in US GAAP.</p>
<p>Pierre Wernert, Senior Consultant at Zanders Treasury and Finance Solutions, offers the following information on the conditions that must be met prior to hedge accounting under IAS 39:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>At the start of the hedge, the hedged item and the hedging instrument has to be identified and designated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the start of the hedge, the hedge relationship must be formally documented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the start of the hedge, the hedge relationship must be highly effective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The effectiveness of the hedge relationship must be tested periodically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ineffectiveness is allowed, provided that the hedge relationship achieves an effectiveness ratio (the level of offset between the two) of between 80% and 125%.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="adopting-ifrs-9">Adopting IFRS 9</h3>
<p>Following a consultation period, the section of IAS 39 relevant to hedge accounting has been updated. According to Umbricht, the new requirements, published under IFRS 9, are intended to reflect business and investor concerns that hedge accounting is “too complicated” and that it unnecessarily excludes some “very well-defined and acceptable hedging strategies”.</p>
<p>IFRS 9 will eventually replace IAS 39. Currently, from an IFRS perspective, the new standard is available for application but in some jurisdictions, such as in Europe, IFRS 9 has not yet been endorsed for inclusion in European law. US GAAP must be used by US companies, of course, but IFRS standards including IFRS 9 can now be used in that jurisdiction by foreign businesses that need to file group reporting by US regulations (such as an entity that has listed debt in the US).</p>
<p>The switch to IFRS 9 for users of hedge accounting was due to become mandatory on 1<sup>st</sup> January 2015 but amendments made to IFRS 9 in November 2013 removed the mandatory effective date (although, as before, businesses in jurisdictions that use IFRS may still choose to apply IFRS 9).</p>
<p>The hedge accounting requirements in IFRS 9 are intended to be less administratively burdensome than IAS 39 by being more closely aligned with risk management. As part of the discussion that led the IASB to make these changes, it was clear that investors in business wanted to be able to understand the risks faced by a particular entity, what its management is doing to manage those risks and how effective those risk management strategies are, says IASB Board Member, Sue Lloyd. It is thus the IASB’s intention “to more closely align hedge accounting with risk management” and to make the presentation of information more accessible to non-accountants. It is, she comments, “a new generation of hedge accounting”.</p>
<p>IFRS 9 retains requirements for documentation of risk and hedging processes. It requires enhanced disclosure around exactly what those risk management activities are when applying hedge accounting. From an auditing viewpoint there are specific requirements to state what will be treated as a hedge accounting relationship and how each will be executed. “Hedge accounting is still complex,” states Umbricht. The changes will not make it easy, “but it will become easier”.</p>
<h3 id="the-role-of-technology">The role of technology</h3>
<p>Blaik Wilson, chairman of treasury technology vendor Reval’s Hedge Accounting Technical Taskforce believes the inherent complexity of hedge accounting, under any ruleset, lends itself to technological intervention. “Companies can enable rules-based processes and workflows which will only allow a hedge relationship to be created, and hedge accounting be conducted, if the appropriate documentation is in play,” he explains. Such solutions – either outsourced or controlled by organisations themselves – can take account of local variations not just of the rules but also in how documentation must be presented; the latter giving rise to the use of templates. “If you haven’t got a robust workflow attached to your processes, elements will be missed,” he warns.</p>
<p>Inappropriate or missing documentation is the number one reason for a hedge ceasing to be eligible for hedge accounting treatment. “One of the reasons it gets picked up frequently is that it is quite an easy audit point to discover, and you’ve either done it correctly or you haven’t,” he notes. “Companies have to be vigilant in their processes to ensure they document every single one of their hedges correctly.”</p>
<h3 id="whats-new">What’s new?</h3>
<p>Despite claims of reduced administrative burden, for example by using more economic concepts to determine whether a relationship is eligible for hedge accounting, IFRS 9 will almost certainly introduce extra work for preparers of financial statements when it comes to disclosure, admits Lloyd. But by providing information that has been designed to help users of financial statements understand the effects of hedging on future cash flows, she argues that it gives a business “the opportunity to better explain its story”.</p>
<p>There are other benefits. For example, companies can now hedge risk components in non-financial items. “IFRS 9 gives companies the ability to use risk components, slicing and dicing the hedged item for risks in non-financial items in the same way as for financial items, as long as the component is reliably measurable and separately identifiable,” explains Ian Farrar, partner in PwC’s Global Accounting Consultancy Services group and leader of PwC’s corporate treasury practice in Hong Kong and China. This, he adds, will be “really useful” for companies dealing with commodities. “If you buy something that has high copper content, with IAS 39 you would have to hedge the whole item; now with IFRS 9 you can just choose to hedge the copper content.” The same componentised approach to hedging applies to airlines and jet fuel, for example. The change effectively means more entities will be able to apply hedge accounting to reflect their risk management activities.</p>
<p>Aggregated exposures – those that have a derivative and non-derivative together – can also now be hedge accounted. The treatment of net positions is changing too. IAS 39 does not allow aggregation of items that have off-setting risk. With IFRS 9 it is now possible, for example, to designate a hedge of both sales and purchases on a gross basis with a net derivative. The downside explains Farrar, is that it is not permissible to recognise those gains and losses within revenues and cost of sales, for example; they have to be reflected in a separate line in the income statement. “In terms of presentation this is not perfect, but certainly it is a big step forward from where we are today.”</p>
<p>There is however a “slight narrowing” of what is possible in terms of using undiscounted spot, notes Umbricht. He points out that application of IAS 39 has been “fairly flexible” when using the spot element of a forward contract to hedge a foreign currency risk that will occur in the future, where the time value of money could be ignored. If a company with a future dollar exposure took a dollar contract, the spot element was fully offset. But, he comments, the IASB has been “very clear” in its requirement to take into account the value of money, and discount back to present value both the hedged item and the hedging instrument. “It’s all fine if the timing is very similar or the interest rate environment of the country where you operate is low,” he notes. “But where you have uncertainty around the timing of the hedged item, and a higher interest-rate environment, this may create more ineffectiveness than we have been used to in the past.”</p>
<h3 id="effectiveness-testing">Effectiveness testing</h3>
<p>One of the most difficult issues to deal with over the years has been hedge effectiveness testing. To be able to use hedge accounting under IAS 39, although IASB does not specify a method of calculating effectiveness, it does stipulate an effectiveness range – a so-called ‘bright line’ within which fair value must fall both prospectively and retrospectively – of between 80% and 125%. With IFRS 9 it is the duty of the business to satisfy auditors that on a prospective basis all intended hedges will be effective. But instead of using arbitrary accounting metrics, it can use information produced internally for risk management purposes. Lloyd believes that this less-prescriptive, more economic model should reduce the costs of implementation compared with those for IAS 39. However, it places the onus on the entity to establish prospectively that there is a sound economic relationship between each asset/liability and its hedge that will provide offset of risk. Failure to continue to do so would result in hedge accounting ceasing for that particular hedge relationship so any volatility experienced for that hedge would then hit the P&amp;L.</p>
<h3 id="what-changing-to-ifrs-9-means">What changing to IFRS 9 means</h3>
<p>For those using IAS 39 or any similar GAAP model, the initial move to IFRS 9 hedge accounting may be seen as yet another issue to overcome. “Some people think hedge accounting is too hard. But put it into perspective; every entity will look at the amount of hedging it does and decide whether it is worth the effort or not,” says Lloyd.</p>
<p>Where US GAAP and IAS 39 hedge accounting had many similarities, IFRS 9 is quite different, notes Wilson, adding that this may create “quite a headache” for global companies who must incorporate disparate GAAP requirements across their various jurisdictions. Lloyd however notes that even where there are differences, hedge accounting is “ultimately a choice”. For Umbricht, the switch from IAS 39 to IFRS 9 signals no major operational undertaking. However, he reserves concern for the UK and Republic of Ireland where changes in local GAAP for statutory accounts will increasingly resemble IFRS rules. Companies in the UK and Ireland will need to move quickly to adapt to the new financial reporting framework, which will impose changes to the format of the financial statements and the disclosures required, becoming effective on 1<sup>st</sup> January 2015.</p>
<p>Lloyd argues that the shift to IFRS 9 represents more opportunity to engage in “finely-tuned” hedge accounting. US GAAP constituents were even encouraged to (and actively did) take part in the consultation period and she believes there may be convergence in time. Until then, businesses may even be “pleasantly surprised” to find that things that weren’t possible before “could now be possible”.</p>
<p>Many of the changes will enable companies to address some of the areas where IAS 39 was causing a “misalignment of accounting with common risk management strategies”, says Farrar. It offers “friendlier accounting” for commodity risk managers, and being able to have derivatives as hedged items will also give companies more flexibility in how they designate hedge relationships. It will also enable them to “avoid some of the problems they have been having with derivatives with non-zero fair values” when going into hedge relationships.</p>
<p>The concluding observations from Wilson on the complexities of hedge accounting and the way in which the rules are changing are impressively forthright. “Businesses changed the way they were hedging economically to make it easier to do the accounting, and that’s not a great situation,” he states. “I don’t think the standard-setters wanted firms to do that; they want businesses to manage their risk the best way they feel they need to, and for the accounting to reflect that. With IAS 39, we’ve often got the tail wagging the dog, with the accounting driving the economic hedging.” Notwithstanding his reservations on the divergence between the likes of US GAAP and IFRS 9, he feels the new international standard for hedge accounting will address most issues by re-aligning accounting with risk management and, on the whole, “gets it right”.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>A sale is not a sale until it’s paid for; so goes the traditional credit controller’s mantra. No matter how successful every other function is in the business, although accounts receivable (AR) is shown in the balance sheet as an asset, the money still has to be collected. In the B2B space, better collection means lower debtor default and lower days sales outstanding (DSO – the average number of days that a company takes to collect revenue after a sale has been made) means the business is stronger in terms of working capital and can extend credit lines to customers, driving up sales; the reverse is true if the process fails.</p>
<p>According to a May 2013 HSBC Global Connections report, on average global companies had $3.1 billion of cash trapped in internal working capital which, it stated, could be unlocked by reducing DSO “to within the median range for their industry”. But research from working capital consultancy REL found that converting sales into cash is getting harder, with cash conversion efficiency in Europe deteriorating three years in a row from 13.4% in 2009 to 10.6% in 2012. Almost certainly connected to this is Experian’s quarterly Late Payment Index finding, issued in November 2013, that the UK’s largest firms are paying overdue bills three days later than at the same point a year earlier and some 15 days later than the country’s smallest businesses.</p>
<h3 id="an-easy-fix">An easy fix?</h3>
<p>The problem with AR, and collections specifically, is that it is subject to a strong cultural and human element – even within large and sophisticated client businesses. Finding improvements will never be easy. Fragmented or missing remittance data, part payments, disputed invoices, persistent use of cash and cheques, variable payment behaviours, almost zero standardisation of remittance formatting – all these things conspire to make the job more difficult. Being able to reduce DSO is not simply a matter of brow-beating debtors into paying on time and supplying accurate remittance data, not least because such an approach can harm commercial relationships.</p>
<p>In its research paper, ‘Buried Treasure: Uncovering cash from your accounts receivable process’, REL points out that a backlog of receivables is, in fact, “really the result of internal processes that need to be optimised”. Asking how to prevent bad debts, reduce billing errors, and minimise payment disputes, it argues, “is much more promising than asking what it will take to get a particular customer to send a cheque”.</p>
<h3 id="too-much-too-soon">Too much, too soon</h3>
<p>With the choice of cash, debit and credit cards, direct debit, direct credit, ACH in US, giro in the Nordics, RiBa (Ricevuta Bancaria) credit transfers in Italy, Direct Entry in Australia, wire transfer (local and international), electronic bill payments via Internet banking and online payment services (such as PayPal and WorldPay) – and a whole host of other regional and local possibilities – the distribution of remittances across multiple formats and channels can make collection and reconciliation even more difficult than it already is.</p>
<p>But as the green shoots of economic recovery show signs of emerging, surely the worst is over and the need to tighten up AR will recede? Not so, says John Salter, Managing Director, Cash Management and Payments, Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking. “Just because things are getting better, don’t take your eye off the ball; the risk element has not gone away.” Empirical evidence, he notes, shows that as many companies emerge from recession, many over-trade by launching too quickly into new markets, delivering too many new products too soon or taking on contracts beyond their capacity. “If they over-trade, they could go bust.”</p>
<h3 id="reconciling-differences">Reconciling differences</h3>
<p>One of the most difficult aspects of the receivables process to improve is the reconciliations process. This difficulty is often linked to the fact that a collection is usually initiated by the debtor and one of the challenges here is that their remittance data is sometimes incomplete or incorrect. There will always be a certain number of exceptions generated including part payments, credit notes and disputed invoices. But even with correct remittance data there may be problems such as insufficient funds being available to settle. Of course, there is a need to avoid upsetting customers with bad debt notices if there is a perfectly reasonable explanation for late or part payment but if an invoice looks like it is not going to be paid on time, the business has to make some firm decisions, especially if it is to prevent a delinquent account turning into a bad debt.</p>
<p>Following the release of the Experian quarterly Late Payment Index, mentioned above, Ade Potts, Managing Director for the firm’s SME division, said that to increase the chances of getting paid faster, credit monitoring was a good first port of call. “This will help to differentiate between those debtors that are unable to pay, those that have the means to pay but have a track record of paying late, and those that are willing and able.”</p>
<p>Indeed, unless a business has a ready source of receivables data to give it advance warning, even a small percentage of exceptions experienced within a large global corporate receivables programme can soon become very costly.</p>
<h3 id="seeking-a-solution">Seeking a solution</h3>
<p>A review of the receivables management process should be seen as a way of enabling the business to focus on the core pillars of its incoming capital. Finding improvements must start with an exploration of how a business is currently being paid by its customers. It will thus be necessary to consider whether or not that model is business- or industry-specific, how well it works and precisely what problems it creates. Asking what the business is trying to achieve by changing the process, and if that process can even be changed, is also essential.</p>
<p>A typical large mainstream retailer, for example, will take notes and coins as part of its collections process because many of its customers still use cash. Gareth Lodge, Senior Analyst at Celent, told Treasury Today in a June 2013 interview that “by the number of transactions, cash is the dominant payment type in every country in the world. It is, in fact, typically more dominant than all other payment types put together”. Not least of the worries with cash-handling is staff security.</p>
<p>It’s true too that some businesses still take (and make) a lot of cheque payments (particularly in the US and India) but cheque payment has an attendant security/fraud issue and extra processing requirement even if US-style lock-boxes are used. Both cash and cheque also typically require in-country banking support which adds to the cost. If payment format is linked to a cultural norm (or habit) it may be possible to change that process slowly over time, perhaps with certain inducements (a discount for those that opt into e-billing for example). Forcing change without a thorough analysis of the needs of the customer-base to help understand their motivations could backfire in terms of increased customer churn.</p>
<p>If change amongst debtors is not immediately possible, receivables and collections improvements may still be implemented but the response to questions asked regarding existing payment norms should be used to find the most appropriate course of action in terms of moulding internal processes to meet that need. For Salter, as an industry advisor, he believes that “it really is a case of understanding by industry, by customer within that industry, by geography, how they operate today”.</p>
<h3 id="automate-and-be-done">Automate and be done?</h3>
<p>Although technology is often seen as the answer to every problem, if the underlying processes are poor, simply automating them will not help. But success with a broad scope of automation is possible. Thomson Reuters received Highly Commended in the Best Process Re-engineering Solution category in the 2013 Adam Smith Awards with its consolidated receivables project. This has delivered a global end-to-end solution enabling automatic allocation of customer payments to customer open AR accounts based on remit information that uses a unique number (similar to a barcode) and also auto reconciling of bank statements to general ledger accounts.</p>
<p>For many firms, direct debit is nirvana in terms of collections. Filipe Simão, Head of Client Advisory, Cash Management, BNP Paribas, is positive about SEPA Direct Debits (SDD) because “never before has the industry had a uniform, standardised way of collecting cross-border”. Being able to centralise all DD activity certainly removes the need for in-country collection accounts which will reduce cost and improve efficiency.</p>
<p>The slow uptake of SDD to date is no mystery, being in part due to the greater difficulty in migrating from existing direct debit systems. With the SEPA credit transfer (SCT) process, moving from a third party local scheme to SEPA is a technical exercise, requiring the conversion of a database of beneficiary account numbers into BIC and IBAN numbers and the capacity to generate XML-formatted payments messages. “SDD is much more complicated because of the way mandate management works,” says Simão. The SDD mandate flow differs from what is in place in most countries, he explains. With SDD, the mandate and its lifecycle will be managed by the creditor. This requires the set-up of new systems and processes and is a migration that cannot be automated to the same degree as SCTs.</p>
<p>In its defence, SEPA is complemented by the B2B SEPA Direct Debit scheme which, if used, removes the risk of rejection of a transaction. Because it requires the debtor’s bank to ensure the collection is authorised (by checking the collection against mandate information) the debtor cannot later claim a refund. “This helps tremendously with treasury forecasting because you know the direct debits are not going to bounce back,” notes Simão.</p>
<p>Another solution in the B2B collections and reconciliations space, he notes, is the concept of the virtual account. Set up and allocated individually to a corporate client’s counterparties for the sole purpose of handling incoming payments, these “dramatically improve the reconciliation rate because we know that whenever a settlement is made using a virtual account number, it relates only to a specific client and counterparty”.</p>
<p>As a variation on this theme, collections via in-country accounts for exporters can be handled through a remote collections process allowing exporters to be paid locally without having to hold and manage a local account. An overseas counterparty pays into an account held by its creditor’s bank; the bank then credits its client’s home account.</p>
<h3 id="there-is-no-panacea">There is no panacea</h3>
<p>So why don’t all businesses just centralise and automate their various AR and collections processes? Firstly, Salter warns, “anything can look good on paper; it’s the execution that’s the challenge”. Indeed, one of the major hurdles is the simple fact that payments and collections will always involve people and people “do not always act rationally”. With direct debits, for example, he notes “it is fascinating how companies are happy to collect their money by DD but don’t want another business debiting their own accounts directly”. Intellectually the systems work, but in practice problems exist because “companies are run by people”. As a result the level of automation is not where he feels it should be.</p>
<p>Secondly, some processes cannot be automated. A major UK-based high street retail client of Lloyds, when discussing working capital drivers, put receivables top of its fix-list, ahead even of payables and inventory. Many of its customers use cash, something that cannot be changed overnight. But by changing the way cash was collected and reported across all branches, its receivables could be better managed. Even something as simple as altering the time the courier arrives to collect the cash meant it could move the receivables book forward gaining one extra days’ value of cash in bank which, given the sums involved, gave it “significant uplift”.</p>
<p>Surely an electronic alternative to cash would work? Marcus Treacher, Global Head of eCommerce for Payments and Cash Management at HSBC, predicts that smartphone contactless payments “will have a huge impact in terms of cost reduction on the cash cycle and more efficient receivables handling for bank processing centres and large retailers such as supermarkets”. But Celent’s Lodge counters that payments behaviour is driven by habit and convenience. “Anyone developing alternative payment systems has to compete with that.” That goes for both B2C and B2B.</p>
<h3 id="a-simple-solution">A simple solution</h3>
<p>There are fundamental principles of improvement that may be applied in terms of what a company does, why it does it and how this fits its operating model from an order-to-pay perspective. Individually, companies can tackle the problem and realise some major improvements. But there is no one-size-fits-all solution: invoices are not standard; customers may not behave as you wish them to; cash and cheque are still endemic; direct debit is feasible only if the business can handle the exceptions – the list goes on.</p>
<p>With customers tending remittance data through different channels, it becomes a demanding task to manipulate the data into a coherent format for ready-use as business intelligence. BIC and IBAN validation services are available for bank account numbers, and data other than the invoice number can be used by receivables systems to reconcile outstanding invoices (such as invoice amount or due-date). Customers can also be requested to quote a structured reference that includes a checksum digit (an error-detecting code) that will immediately highlight a discrepancy.</p>
<p>If it is possible, digitising, and by extension standardising, remittance information would be a major improvement in the straight through flow of remittance data – and Thomson Reuters has proven that it can be done. Outsourcing some or all AR processes to a bank or to another third-party provider with a broad global footprint and economies of scale in terms of technology (notably around auto-reconciliation and matching) and AR expertise, can deliver benefits but at a cost and with some inevitable loss of control.</p>
<p>The obvious way to remove customer error is for the creditor to take control of collections initiation (using direct debit in particular), says Simão. In the B2C space, electronic bill presentment and payment (EBPP) enables bills to be created and sent by the creditor, and paid by the debtor through their electronic banking account; they cannot change remittance data which resolves the reconciliations problem. In the B2C sector generally there has been a lack of integration of these systems so consumers have to login to a separate EBPP website for each of their suppliers, although Belgium’s Zoomit (which requires a one-off registration on the creditor’s website) and the multi-channel SEPAmail (developed in France but designed with the SEPA zone in mind) claim to address this issue.</p>
<p>For Salter though there is one significant improvement that can be applied that does not add cost, does not rely on technology nor cause any loss of oversight. “If you really want to improve your receivables, train your sales people,” he states. At the front line, if sales people can encourage customers to use the preferred payment option, half the battle is won. “Good receivables always start with the sale, not with the back office trying to drive a change of process.” This logical approach harks back to the opening statement that a sale is not a sale until it is paid for; it may not be popular with sales people but it must be a change for good the if it removes problems downstream and provides clear, timely and useful information that keeps a company liquid and, ultimately, afloat in a sea of uncertainty.</p></div>

<p>The challenges corporates encounter when rolling out a commercial card programme in Asia will differ considerably between jurisdictions. In a country such as Singapore, for example, it is relatively straightforward. It is a highly competitive market with a large number of providers, and companies tend to be more receptive to the use of commercial cards.</p>
<p>But for a country such as China, the process is much more complex. The regulators have only recently given permission to foreign banks to issue commercial cards. Even now, as the economy begins to open up, foreign issuers in China may not be acquirers or merchants. This situation can be a challenge for banks, as their submissions have to rely on local institutions’ network which could potentially impact the merchant’s fee for corporates. Therefore when working in China, you have to think very carefully about what you want to achieve from the card programme, and then choose one which is aligned with your company’s strategy and direction.</p>
<p>There are also challenges when establishing a corporate card programme in India, although not as extensive as in China. In India, the challenge concerns the management of cards. Although commercial cards are widely accepted, sometimes airlines refuse to accept the merchant’s fee, which will then get passed onto the agent and subsequently back to the company.</p>
<p>A tug-of-war between the company, employer and management is often a problem in India, too. Financial executives may not be keen on using the card because of the percentages the company is required to pay. Even 3%, after all, can become quite a substantial figure when you are thinking of 5,000 cards and travel costs totalling millions of dollars. However, with improved working capital and reduced administration hassle with an automated expense payment system and control, using a corporate card is an optimal direction to go in.</p>
<p>Other emerging markets, such as Vietnam and Indonesia, represent a significant challenge for us. Although commercial cards are available, the issuing banks are not where they should be as yet. As a big corporation we need to be able to have confidence in the bank’s IT system. Therefore, whether or not the bank has future plans to invest in developing its card products and its IT systems these always are important factors in our considerations when looking for card solutions in those particular countries.</p>
<figure class="portrait left"><img alt="Portrait of Jason Tiede" height="150" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/2013/09/2013-09-tta-04-qa-jason-tiede-100x150.jpg" width="100"/></figure>
<h5 id="jason-tiede-head-of-cards-and-emerging-payments-asia-pacific-bank-of-america-merrill-lynch">Jason Tiede, Head of Cards and Emerging Payments, Asia Pacific, Bank of America Merrill Lynch:</h5>
<p>Our clients have found that launching a commercial card programme can be one of the more appealing ways to optimise working capital, increase process efficiency, gain visibility into purchasing trends and improve control of employee spend.</p>
<p>Travel and entertainment (T&amp;E) typically accounts for 7%-10% of a company’s annual expenses. Building a sound corporate expense policy, and controlling and analysing this spend with an end-to-end corporate card solution, drives significant bottom line benefits for clients. Even more exciting is the continued growth of purchase card (p-card) programmes in Asia Pacific. With real-time card management tools and virtual cards, p-card solutions are extremely effective at eliminating costly and inefficient paper processes related to supplier payments. Besides driving process efficiency, p-card programmes extend days payable outstanding (DPOs) and are widely accepted across many supplier categories such as telecom, shipping and professional services.</p>
<p>Given the maturity of commercial card solutions, there are a surprising number of large, Asia Pacific-headquartered corporations that have not launched a commercial card programme. These companies may still be relying on antiquated spreadsheet-based expense reimbursement processes and personal credit cards. Historically, companies may have been concerned with providing cards with a corporate credit line to employees. But those fears have been alleviated through the formalisation of robust corporate expense policies, insurance programmes offered in parallel with commercial card solutions, and control features such as merchant category blocking and real-time card management tools. Once clients learn about all the benefits and features, they are encouraged, and sometimes surprised, that commercial card solutions actually increase transparency and control when compared to personal credit cards.</p>
<p>Characterised by unique economies and regulatory structures, most challenges for corporate clients in Asia Pacific revolve around delivering a locally relevant and compliant commercial card solution that maintains global consistency, visibility and control. It is important for clients to work with a bank that has a deep understanding of each country and, more importantly, delivers a truly localised product that is ‘wrapped’ with a global card management tool. Prioritising key countries based on the size of a client’s employee base, supplier demographics and the greatest travel and procurement spend is important to rapidly reap the greatest benefits.</p>
<p>Once key markets are selected, card acceptance is the name of the game. With companies and their clients, suppliers and partners rapidly expanding across the globe, a commercial card programme is only as good as the worldwide acceptance of the card itself. This is especially true in Asia Pacific where international travel is standard for employees and cross-border supplier relationships are common. MasterCard and Visa provide unparalleled global acceptance at more than 36 million merchants, as well as enhanced data for many spend categories such as airlines and hotels. The greater the card acceptance, the greater the visibility to global expenses and the significant value that can be derived through negotiating leverage with suppliers and travel partners.</p>
<p>Finally, clients are challenged to ensure the highest level of service for their employees when launching a commercial card programme across multiple Asia Pacific markets. Partnering with a commercial card provider with a passion for service is critical for long-term programme success. After all, a company’s employees are their most valuable asset. At Bank of America Merrill Lynch, we believe the greatest return on relationship is to provide not only world-class commercial card solutions but the highest level of service to our clients.</p>

<p>Asia is an amalgamation of diverse geographies, market practices, regulatory regimes and cultures, and developing an understanding these differences is the first challenge for a multinational company (MNC) planning to roll out a commercial cards programme.</p>
<p>The region’s fragmented business landscape means that the majority of corporate payments are transacted in cash. What’s more, many countries in the region have their own proprietary networks for commercial cards, making it more difficult for MNCs to have a standardised regional solution. For example, in China, the local cards network, UnionPay, has its own systems, regulations and practices that are significantly different from what companies from other regions would be used to.</p>
<p>In addition, the regulatory situation in Asia is different compared with the rest of the world. Even though Citi offers a corporate liability programme across the region, which is consistent with how we operate as a global provider, the requirements from a documentation and a Know Your Customer (KYC) perspective mean that our clients need to do a lot more in Asia than they typically would in EMEA or North America. Citi’s corporate cards solution bridges the gaps for companies by providing a globally consistent, locally compliant programme across the region.</p>

<p>“Implementing and optimising a commercial cards programme is an excellent way to do this,” says Andy Lyons, Commercial Card Sales at Lloyds Banking Group. “Although many companies are familiar with corporate charge cards for managing their business travel and expenses, the card market – and its benefits – go far deeper than that. Purchasing cards, for example, are now coming into focus as a means of moving companies out of a labour-intensive paper environment, towards a streamlined, end-to-end procure-to-pay process.” When it typically costs between £25-30 to process an invoice manually, the benefits seem obvious.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>But cards are about more than ‘quick-win’ cost savings. “Card programmes, whether they revolve around corporate cards, purchasing cards, prepaid cards or an amalgam of those, are a very effective means of helping clients to manage both internal and external workflows more efficiently,” continues Lyons. “Yes, there are significant cost savings to be made, and naturally that is a driver, but there a number of additional benefits to consider. While these may take slightly longer to materialise, or may be more difficult to tangibly measure, it’s a question of extending value across areas of the business that often haven’t previously been touched.”</p>
<p>So, how do commercial card programmes fit into the broader cash management cycle and how can they assist corporates in weathering tough economic times?</p>
<h3 id="adding-value-through-cards">Adding value through cards</h3>
<p>Looking to implement or to optimise an existing card programme may, understandably, be just another project on the ‘to do’ pile for treasurers at the moment. Taking a more macro view however, a number of the challenges that are currently being faced by treasury, procurement and finance departments can be overcome through the deployment of a suitable card programme.</p>
<p>Take for example the need to deliver improved cash management and working capital efficiencies. Using a corporate credit card scheme, companies can effectively eliminate the need for advance cash flow, whilst giving their employees an easy-to-use payment method that is widely accepted, wherever they may be travelling.</p></div>

<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Corporate cards also enable procure-to-pay processes to be streamlined. For instance, the manual processing of reimbursements for an employee’s expenses incurred on their personal card can be enhanced with the integration of transaction data into an expenses or accounting software package. In addition, companies increasingly want their employees to use corporate cards because of the valuable management information (MI) that can be gained and analysed through online technology.</p>
<p>This financial data enables the Accounts Payable (AP) department to have increased visibility and control over expenditure, and therefore greater insight into the company’s overall cash position. “A corporate card implementation is a swift, cost-effective means of tracking and controlling the business-related expenses of employees. By removing paper out of the system and having data available at the click of a button, corporates can find out what has been purchased, where, when and by whom, as well as whether it is in line with their governance policies,” comments Lyons. This helps to ensure that company money is spent with preferred suppliers, and that all negotiated pricing deals are being taken advantage of.</p>
<p>It is not just corporate credit cards that deliver these benefits. Purchasing cards, also known as p-cards, which have long been used for low-value purchases in the corporate space are being used to bring greater visibility and control over tail-end business spend. Detailed, level three line item data which includes purchase information such as a description of the product, quantity and price is made available and similarly this information can be used to see exactly what is spent and where improvements can be made. The real savings opportunity available does not only come from the tail-end spend though, but through convincing corporates to use their cards to procure their more strategic supplier spend.</p>
<p>“Budget expenditure can also be managed in a far more granular way as corporates can add specific “codes” to the data that they have gleaned, assigning purchases to the appropriate cost centre and general ledgers for example,” continues Lyons. “Where cash is king for the traditional payments market, MI is king for cards.”</p>
<p>How quickly clients obtain that MI is also key. Corporates no longer want to wait to receive statements on a monthly basis, they want the relevant information available throughout the month, rather than having a shock at the end of the four weeks. Card programmes can deliver this and banks can add additional value with reporting functionalities, as well as seamless integration into the company’s internal systems for automatic reconciliation, controlling and efficiently managing budget allocation as well as overall spend analysis.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Elsewhere, spend information can be useful in consolidating purchases – and indeed currencies. As such, rather than making a number of one-off payments to a particular supplier, a single monthly payment can be processed. Not only does this further streamline operational processes, it also offers the opportunity to extend the company’s payables cycle. For instance, when paying by cheque, the float is usually only a few days. By using a card solution the supplier can be paid a few days after the purchase, but the company does not have to pay off the amount on the card until it becomes due – potentially adding an extra twenty-eight days or so to the monthly payables cycle.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><h3 id="reaching-further">Reaching further</h3>
<p>Where external workflows and relationships are concerned, card programmes also have a lot to offer. An area of particular benefit is that of buyer-supplier relationships. Through the use of a flexible card programme, both buyers and suppliers can meet their often conflicting needs more readily. In other words, suppliers get paid on time and in a more consistent manner. This helps the supplier’s cash flow, meaning that they are less likely to encounter financial troubles and are also more likely to look favourably on the buyer, thereby improving relationships and potentially leading to discounts for loyalty. Looking after suppliers in this way also helps treasurers to align themselves with industry best practice.</p>
<p>According to Lyons, “This should provide sufficient ammunition for buyers to talk again with their suppliers about how the benefits of using cards can significantly outweigh the merchant costs that the supplier has to bear. Moreover, the supplier will see improved internal efficiencies themselves – for example they would not have to take on the risk of accepting cheques, or the labour-intensive task of chasing late payments.”</p>
<p>But this discussion touches on one of the most difficult challenges associated with card acceptance in the corporate space today: perception. “It’s relatively easy to identify the opportunities that a card programme could bring,” admits Lyons. “The hardest part of the process is to convert people across the organisation from working in a paper-based environment to an electronic one. For instance, a number of companies feel comfortable working with cheques – as this is what they know – but really a prepaid card or a p-card could make the process much easier for everyone: from procurement to finance and operations.”</p>
<p>There is also a tendency to feel that by taking away the tangible elements of a process (ie paper), a corporate is relinquishing its control over that process. “Paper is seen as safe. There is nervousness around cards, in particular in areas such as fraud. In actual fact, card fraud is less frequent than fraudulent cheques. It’s about getting people comfortable and helping them to understand where commercial savings and operational efficiencies can be made.”</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>When corporates are open minded about their end-to-end procure-to-pay process, is where banks such as Lloyds can really add significant value, says Lyons. “Clients often have a preconceived idea about what cards can deliver for them and when this is the case, they don’t tend to derive the maximum amount of benefit. So what we want to be able to do is pass on intellectual capital and experience to our clients. Rather than seeing them realise 10% of their commercial savings through cards, we want them to get up to the 75-80% mark. The more corporate spend that a company can put onto a card as part of a common process, the more they will benefit.”</p>
<h3 id="a-dynamic-market">A dynamic market</h3>
<p>Despite a reduction in the amount of corporate travel and business expenditure being sanctioned, the commercial card market continues to blossom.</p>
<p>Solid growth is expected over the coming years, and with that we are starting to see exciting developments in card offerings.</p>

<p> will see the launch of five new card products from Lloyds Bank, which will complement the bank’s existing corporate card and p-card solutions. Elsewhere, an interesting market development that Lyons sees is growth in the commercial cards space as the usage of cheques declines.</p>
<p>Indeed, although cheques have now been given a reprieve from being abolished in the UK, cards are beginning to take a large chunk of market share. Figures from 2001 show that cards represented a mere 8% of UK payments, in 2011 that figure was 26%.</p>
<p>By 2016, 39% of UK payments are expected to be made by card. “I believe prepaid cards will soon become a very popular alternative to cheques among corporates,” explains Lyons. In his view, it really isn’t a question of ‘if’, but ‘when’.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-is-just-the-start">Implementation is just the start</h3>
<p>For those corporates contemplating the implementation of a card scheme, or putting their existing programmes out to tender, Lyons has some parting words of advice: “Really look end-to-end in the procure-to-pay process, spend time analysing what different expenditure you have and be honest about how much control you genuinely have over that expenditure today.</p>
<p>Also, how long after the event do you know that something has been purchased? In answering these questions, the benefits of a well-run card programme – and where your current set-up is falling down – should become clear.”</p>
<p>However, continues Lyons, “A card programme is not just about the implementation and on-boarding, it is about the ongoing management and development of that programme. At Lloyds, we work closely with treasurers, procurement and finance teams to really help them understand the processes that should be put in place to achieve this optimisation – such as how best to manage the movement and exportation of spend data into their accounting software or TMS.”</p>
<p>In summary, by leveraging technology and the expertise of bank (and in-house) card gurus, companies can achieve compelling results across the business through commercial cards usage.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Corporations with subsidiaries around the globe are faced with the issue of how best to structure their foreign currency payments. The chosen payment model will have implications in terms of regulation, risk management and balance optimisation. In this Business Briefing, Treasury Today explores the argument for moving to a more streamlined account model and the benefits that can be achieved by such a move.</p>
<p>Since the outset of the financial crisis, treasurers worldwide have been more focused than ever on streamlining operations across the board. By making the most of funds within the business, treasurers can reduce the need for external funding.</p>
<p>Cash pooling is a tool used by treasurers to optimise the interest on surplus balances – or to remove the need for external finance. But for corporations with subsidiaries around the world holding accounts in a range of local currencies, their existing account structures may not allow them to concentrate cash as effectively as they might do.</p>
<p>Many corporates have a decentralised structure whereby local subsidiaries make payments in local currencies. Such structures may not allow the level of visibility that a treasurer requires in the current market, which in turn can limit the corporate’s ability to manage counterparty exposures. “If it takes a week to get a view of where balances are, by the time it’s reported you know it’s out of date,” comments Seamus Desouza, Executive Director, Foreign Exchange, J.P. Morgan Treasury Services. “With some of the market movements we’ve had in recent years, taking a week to understand your counterparty risk is no longer a viable option.”</p>
<h3 id="the-issues">The issues</h3>
<p>Treasurers operating a decentralised account structure may encounter the following issues and challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Transparency.</h5>
<p>For companies managing foreign currency payments in a variety of currencies, transparency can be a significant challenge. This is particularly the case when it comes to restricted currencies. Treasurers may struggle to get answers to questions such as: what was the rate achieved? When was the payment actually received by the beneficiary? How should such payments be formatted?</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Balance management.</h5>
<p>Are subsidiaries overfunded? If payments in local currency are made from local accounts, it is likely that the corporation will have balances in a number of different currencies, which may or may not be earning interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Risk management.</h5>
<p>In a decentralised account structure, currency exposures may not be managed as effectively as they could be on a more centralised basis. A diverse range of banking relationships at the local level can also imply greater counterparty risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Inefficient processes.</h5>
<p>The more complex the payments process, the greater the likelihood that payments will be delayed or lost.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="multiple-accounts-multiple-currencies">Multiple accounts, multiple currencies</h3>
<p>The use of multiple local currency accounts for both payments and receipts is widespread. However, this practice brings with it certain disadvantages. Using local accounts for both payments and receipts increases the complexity from a cash flow forecasting point of view, which often means that forecasting is carried out by local subsidiaries, making overall visibility of projected cash flows problematic.</p>
<h3 id="models-for-funding-subsidiaries-payments">Models for funding subsidiaries’ payments</h3>
<p>When a corporation needs to fund local subsidiaries, it may choose either to send funds in the company’s functional currency, or to send funds in the local currency. Broadly speaking, there are four different models, which can be used in various combinations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Fund with hard currency into local accounts</h4>
<p>Based on publicly available rates, the treasury centre pays euro or dollar into the local account. Currency conversion into local currency therefore takes place at the local level. This model is used commonly by smaller US corporates or occasionally by corporates in Western Europe.</p>
<p>For companies which choose to send funds in local currency, there are several different models:</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Fund with local currency into local currency accounts</h4>
<p>This may be appropriate when there are local currency receipts and most payments are in the functional currency of the business unit being funded. Cash management takes place locally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Fund positions in local currencies ‘just-in-time’</h4>
<p>When the total payable amounts are known, and are periodic rather than daily, payments can be made via a local provider who carries out an FX transaction on-shore and then feeds back the total hard currency value for the funding movement to be executed ‘just-in-time’ for the local disbursements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Pay local currencies cross border from a hard currency account directly to the suppliers</h4>
<p>Used by all corporates to one extent or another, the fourth model gives the central treasury the greatest degree of certainty and control. This model may offer the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Balance management.</h5>
<p>While this arrangement may not result in improved FX rates, it reduces the likelihood of having surpluses in some accounts and overdrafts in others, or of small balances in a number of different currencies which may not be earning interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Counterparty risk.</h5>
<p>By reducing the balances held by local providers – and the length of time that balances are held – counterparty risk may be reduced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Currency exposure management.</h5>
<p>Depending on corporate policy, a more centralised payments process enables currency exposures to be carried out centrally and more effectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Simpler to structure intercompany arrangements for currency exposures.</h5>
<p>As payments are coming out of an account denominated in the group functional currency, the treasury centre has improved flexibility in terms of deciding how those exposures are to be hedged. In comparison, if each unit is holding a balance in different local currencies, this exposure is generally managed using FX swaps.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In reality, corporates tend to use a mixture of these different models depending on the nature of their operations. However, supporting all of the different models can prove to be a challenge. The fourth model, if used comprehensively, can offer a more streamlined overall solution, as outlined in the schematic below:</p>
<figure class="center">

</figure>
<p>Furthermore, rather than holding multiple local currency accounts, it can be more efficient to hold a single account for global foreign currency payments.</p>
<p>“A lot of treasuries are now looking towards the single account model, rather than holding multiple accounts in multiple currencies for payments,” comments Seamus Desouza. “Even if they hold accounts in multiple currencies for receipts, they don’t necessarily want to use those accounts to make payments.”</p>
<p>Often the purpose of such a model is to increase control from a balance management point of view. In contrast to the multiple account approach, funds from a local account which is for receipts only can simply be concentrated up to a header account.</p>

</div>
<p>Plan International is a children’s development organisation that works to promote child rights and alleviate child poverty in 48 developing countries across Asia, Africa and the Americas. Three years ago it initiated a major change in the way money transfers were made between its international headquarters and the countries in which it runs programmes. Now, with most of the changes in place, the NGO is enjoying massive improvements in time, savings and efficiencies.</p>
<p>Plan International has an annual turnover of over €500m, which is raised by member organisations in 20 countries including UK, Australia, Canada, USA, Norway, Japan, South Korea and Ireland. Each of these separate legal entities raises funds locally, in local currencies. These funds are sent to the central treasury, which consists of four full time employees. The central treasury then remits funds to the programme’s countries in accordance with their budget and their cash flow forecast to minimise the risk of large balances in-country.</p>
<p>“For an international charity, the timely receipt of funds can have implications beyond the financial health of the organisation,” explains Annemarie Moore, Group Treasurer. “Once we needed to get medication to a group of refugees, and in order to get the medication we needed to purchase fuel for the van,” she recalls. “Funds arriving late and with good value really doesn’t help in that situation, because by that time you haven’t got the fuel, you haven’t got the medicine and you can’t help the refugees.”</p>
<h5 id="from-in-country-currency-conversion-to-centralised-procurement">From in-country currency conversion to centralised procurement</h5>
<p>Until 2007, in order to distribute funds from Plan International’s central treasury to its expenditure countries, annual budgets were drawn up for all of these countries in US dollars. Once the budget was approved, throughout the year the organisation’s hard currency receipts were sold up to 15 months forward in exchange for US dollars. The central treasury then remitted US dollars to each country in accordance with the predetermined budget and cash flow forecast. Each country would convert the US dollars on receipt to local currency at the prevailing spot exchange rate.</p>
<p>This process had some serious disadvantages. Due to exchange rate fluctuations, none of the non-USD spend or pegged receiving countries could be sure how much local currency they would receive during the course of the year. This discrepancy was welcomed by staff working in countries with depreciating currencies. However, those based in countries with appreciating currencies often found that the US dollar funds they received did not buy enough local currency to meet their committed programmes.</p>
<p>Consequently, the decision was taken to change the process in order to draw up budgets in local currency and to deliver funds to each country in local currency where possible. For the central treasury, this meant that expenditure on currency exchange rate moves would need to be hedged to ensure that local currency budgets could be fulfilled.</p>
<h5 id="the-migration">The migration</h5>
<p>The first step was to revisit the company’s banking arrangements. Whereas banks had previously been appointed on a by-location basis, a regional banking programme was put in place in consultation with staff in the individual countries. The intention was for each country in a particular region to bank with the appointed bank. This was approached on a region-by-region basis, shortlisting banks which best matched Plan’s geographical footprint and then assessing their operational capabilities in order to identify the appropriate bank for each region.</p>
<p>On a central basis, rather than continuing to use two separate banks for US dollar and euro payments, the corporation appointed J.P. Morgan as its main central bank for non-regional payments, due to its strong capabilities in both currencies.</p>
<p>Part of Moore’s intention was to eliminate the use of correspondent banks in the payments routing process. “I wanted smooth routing, eliminating these partner banks along the way, which means there is less opportunity for funds being delayed,” comments Moore. “The solution was to bank centrally with the same regional banks so funds move from the treasury bank account to the programme country’s bank account with minimum intervention by third party banks.”</p>
<p>After migrating each country to the new banking arrangements, the next step was to determine which countries could receive funds in local currency. “We drilled down to see which currency each country was spending, whether it could be bought outside the country and whether it would be a slower transmission in local currency,” says Moore. The chosen countries were migrated to local currency delivery in batches of up to five. “I didn’t want a big bang approach, because if something went wrong we would then have a lot of payment issues to resolve all at once and many countries waiting for funds,” Moore explains.</p>
<p>Today, each programme country budgets in local currency, with around 45% of the countries receiving local currency from the group treasury and another 5% due to migrate to this model. The budget expenditure is hedged centrally using Non-Deliverable Forwards. FX pricing, which was previously opaque, is now transparent and banking arrangements are centralised wherever possible.</p>
<p>The project is now 95% complete, with a regional bank yet to be appointed for Central South America. Summarising the ingredients that have made the project successful, Moore comments, “It is important to have a good project management team in the region, as well as a good project team at the bank. One key point is to ensure that you are driving the project, which I achieved by having weekly phone calls that incorporated both teams in the region, ours and the bank’s, plus myself and the bank’s representative in the UK. If you don’t communicate regularly, the project can easily go on everyone’s back burner.”</p>
</div>
<h3 id="making-the-move">Making the move</h3>
<p>When it comes to moving to a more efficient payments model, Desouza observes a marked difference between industries. “The oil companies have moved fastest and many of them, regardless of whether or not they are paying ‘on behalf of’, have moved to a position where they substantially make all their foreign currency payments from a single currency.”</p>
<p>Other large corporates are now looking to take the next step in payments optimisation. When re-engineering the company’s payments structure, treasurers should consider how local currency balances are currently managed, how many accounts are being kept open and how many employees have access to these accounts. Desouza offers the following advice to companies looking to make the move:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Talk to your main payments bank – it can probably distribute more currencies than you realise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand what local accounts are being used for. Even if accounts are just used for payments and receipts, taking payables centrally might simplify the overall process, even if the accounts need to be kept open for receivables purposes and swept periodically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a close look at your reporting mechanisms. If these are not efficient they will be weakening your ability to manage counterparty risk.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="obstacles">Obstacles</h3>
<p>The first potential obstacle to consider when streamlining a company’s foreign currency payments structure is the arrangements and capabilities offered by the chosen bank. Is the bank able to accept instructions for both freely tradable and restricted currencies in the same way, as far as possible? While no single bank is able to offer full capabilities across every country in the world, there is more scope for achieving consistency by using agents and partners. Corporates should be looking for a consistent service at the point at which the instruction is executed – although minor variations will be inevitable in certain markets.</p>
<p>Local regulations can also represent an obstacle. In particular, the following may have implications for the treatment of payments:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Resident vs. non-resident.</h5>
<p>Different conditions may apply depending on whether the remitter and/or the beneficiary are designated as resident or non-resident in their respective countries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Corporate vs. individual.</h5>
<p>Different conditions may apply depending on whether the beneficiary is a corporate or an individual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Reason for payment.</h5>
<p>In some jurisdictions, different types of regulation will apply according to the payment type, with capital movements and investments typically attracting more regulation than trade flows. The remitter may need to provide information clarifying that a particular payment is for the payment of an invoice.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other considerations may also need to be factored in. For example, if centralising activities or reducing the number of accounts held by a local unit puts the local unit into a weaker position in terms of bank negotiations, this may create internal resistance to the migration. Furthermore, in some cases, the beneficiary is subject to deductions for cross-border payments.</p>
<h3 id="the-way-forward">The way forward</h3>
<p>“We’re certainly nowhere near the end state,” comments Seamus Desouza. “Corporates still face difficulties in this area, mainly due to large variations in local practice, regulations, and payment standards.</p>
<p>Going forward, Desouza believes, only the banks offering the largest scale and comprehensive solution will be able to provide treasurers with a globally consistent payment process from the point of initiation. “If a treasurer wants to make a payment in currency X and one in currency Y, they want the process to be the same in both cases – or they risk losing a lot of the benefits of going to one provider. The providers which will continue to prevail are the ones that are most experienced at selecting in-country partners and agents. That’s how they are able to offer consistency to their end clients.”</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p>A means of providing corporate customers with a streamlined and cost effective way of paying for expenses and settling business to business transactions, the use of commercial cards continues to grow globally. In this Business Briefing we look at the types of cards available to corporates today, as well as the importance of global card programmes to the treasury function. We also examine how the regulatory environment is shaping card usage.</p>
<h3 id="the-market-today">The market today</h3>
<p>As companies are becoming more global, and treasury functions are moving towards a centralised model, commercial cards have become an increasingly important tool for efficient cash management.</p>
<p>Commercial cards allow companies to move away from legacy, paper-based accounts payable (AP) processes, to realise the benefits of automating AP and to meet increasingly tough performance goals.</p>
<p>The shift towards electronic AP, as evidenced by the graph below, has been heavily influenced by the difficult economic environment, with corporates focusing on greater cost cutting, improved working capital management, and increased control and visibility.</p>

<p>Card programmes that leverage state-of-theart technology can help corporates to achieve significant, and indeed, almost immediate results in these key areas of focus.</p>
<div class="boxed">
<h3 id="overview-of-card-types">Overview of card types</h3>
<p>There are three main types of commercial card available today:</p>
<h4 id="corporate-cards">Corporate cards</h4>
<p>Best known as travel and entertainment (T&amp;E) cards, corporate cards are by no means a new offering; however, the technology behind them has improved significantly in recent years. “T&amp;E is one of the most controllable corporate expenses, which can represent 1.5-3% of a company’s total revenue,” says Cate Luzio, Head of EMEA &amp; Canada Commercial Card, J.P. Morgan. As such, companies are looking to reduce expenses, optimise their working capital and gain full visibility over expenditure via card programmes. By establishing a global card programme, company T&amp;E expense data can be consolidated, currencies can also be consolidated, and revenue can be generated through cash rebates. T&amp;E cards eliminate the need for advance cash flow and provide an easy to use, widely accepted payment method. Certain cards also carry executive privileges such as VIP travel services and insurance.</p>
<h4 id="purchasing-cards">Purchasing cards</h4>
<p>Corporate purchasing cards, or P-cards, have long been used for low-value purchases. Increasingly, P-cards are being recognised not just for their ease of use, but also for their ability to bring visibility and transparency to the low-value purchase-to-pay cycle. Detailed purchase information such as description of the product, quantity and price is now standard. This information can be used to see exactly what is spent and where improvements can be made. P-cards are more evolved in the UK, US, Canada and Australia today but the market continues to evolve globally and corporates demands for global P-cards are growing. Cards for single-use or limited use accounts (also known as virtual card accounts), already heavily used in the US, are also proving increasingly popular in Europe as a means of improving control and security around corporate spend.</p>
<h4 id="prepaid-cards">Prepaid cards</h4>
<p>A simple, pre-funded electronic disbursement solution, these cards can be issued by a company to its employees. Cardholders can use the card to purchase goods and services, make purchases online, pay bills or get instant access to their funds 24 hours a day. Prepaid corporate cash cards can provide many benefits including the elimination of costly cheque and cash issuance – cheques can be lost, stolen, delayed in the mail or reissued and it is a safer alternative to cash. These cards can also increase control and visibility of spend by providing a full audit trail, can give the cardholder immediate access to funds and can be used as an alternative T&amp;E card, for infrequent travellers for example. While popular in the US, Europe is lagging in development here and prepaid cards remain more of a consumer product rather than a commercial product for the time being.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="the-need-for-a-global-card-programme">The need for a global card programme</h3>
<p>Globalisation has driven multinational companies to centralise back office functions in order to realise visibility benefits, together with economies of scale and efficiencies in cash management. In order to achieve this vision of a unified global company, access to data is king. As such, companies have been investing in enterprise-wide finance systems, and are constantly seeking consistency in their global interfaces. A properly managed global card programme can deliver numerous benefits, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Improved reporting and data delivery.</h5>
<p>Not only does richer data assist in identifying misuse of cards earlier, thereby enhancing control, access to consolidated spend data can help to drive strategic sourcing. Reporting can also be improved if the detailed data is then integrated into the general ledger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Economies of scale.</h5>
<p>By leveraging global rather than regional spend, companies can improve their purchasing power and negotiate better rates with vendors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Reduced costs.</h5>
<p>The amount of manual labour surrounding paper invoices for example is reduced by a card programme, as statements are received electronically. This presents opportunities for automated reconciliation, reducing administration costs and freeing up staff for more value-added tasks. The company’s global funding costs should also reduce with a tailored card programme as fraud risk is reduced, and spending limits can be more easily managed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But, is consistency in card programmes across jurisdictions a possibility?</p>
<h3 id="industry-challenges">Industry challenges</h3>
<p>According to Luzio, one of the major challenges in offering a global card programme is the impact of regulation on the way that issuers conduct business across markets.</p>
<p>In Europe, the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) and the EU Payment Services Directive (PSD) have introduced some hurdles for issuers, with much discussion around multi-lateral interchange fees (MIF) for intra-regional transactions. The MIF is a percentage fee which is paid per card transaction by the acquiring bank to the issuing bank. While these discussions have so far revolved around consumer transactions, commercial cards are likely to be affected in the medium-term.</p>
<p>The swathe of new regulation across Europe has also meant that card transactions in the region are now far more controlled than in other global markets, even more mature markets such as the US. According to Luzio, since the changes in regulation, clients with European card programmes and issuers alike have had to revisit paperwork surrounding card programmes to ensure compliance, which has introduced some hurdles to standardising the compliance requirements for global schemes. However, while SEPA and the PSD have presented challenges, as a result of these initiatives, the European arena has put in place a number of mechanisms around control, data privacy and protection, and fraud prevention. “Anything that helps towards protecting the client can only be a positive move,” says Luzio.</p>
<p>Another key challenge with multi-jurisdictional programmes is the pace of expansion, which is often rapid. Therefore, it is frequently difficult for key vendors and/or outsource partners to expand at the same rate as their customers and the card issuers themselves. This means that the acceptance rate for some cards may be lower in certain jurisdictions.</p>

<h5 id="why-should-commercial-cards-be-a-concern-for-treasury-not-just-the-procurement-function">Why should commercial cards be a concern for treasury, not just the procurement function?</h5>
<p>Over the past 24 months, treasurers have been working even harder at finding effective ways to maximise their working capital, and also to reduce their expenses. Given that T&amp;E can represent up to 3% of a company’s revenue, the numbers here are significant.</p>
<p>As such, treasurers are looking at best practices around expenditure, how to optimise their cash flows, and how to remove the need to pre-fund expenses with cash allowances or cash flows. Managing this properly frees up cash that can be redeployed, providing additional liquidity for the corporate, enabling reinvestment of funds, to earn additional interest for example.</p>
<p>There’s also a revenue sharing angle here, because of the rebate opportunity. Traditionally in the US, rewards have been a big incentive for companies, especially in the middle market segment, but today, when there is a cash rebate on offer, the treasurer and the procurement manager have the opportunity to bring funds back to the company’s bottom line.</p>
<p>Global multinationals and large corporates tend to be more interested in a financial incentive rather than rewards. The broader card programmes can be, both in terms of geography and company scope, the increased rebate a company can earn.</p>
<p>Finally, treasurers and CFOs are now looking at the end-to-end value chain and commercial cards are a part of achieving a full end-to-end solution.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-the-major-challenges-in-implementing-a-global-card-programme-from-a-clients-point-of-view">What are the major challenges in implementing a global card programme, from a client’s point of view?</h5>
<p>Looking at the clients that we have helped with implementing a card programme to date, a successful programme really comes down to corporate policy and mandate. In many firms, in particular SMEs, employees still use personal cards for their expenses. Overcoming this legacy behaviour can certainly be a challenge, so the message really has to be ‘top down’; the treasurer, the procurement manager and the travel manager need to enforce use of the commercial cards, whilst explaining the reasons why.</p>
<p>With a global implementation, there are of course challenges across the different countries involved, such as securing buy-in, coping with varying local legislation, managing contracts and also harmonising the speed and ease of implementation. As such, it is very important that from an implementation perspective to have a global implementation manager.</p>
<p>This allows for end-to-end support for the process of implementation globally, so that there is a single point of contact for the client. Once the programme has been implemented, the provider’s consultative support should be ongoing, with the programme being reviewed as it matures. After the programme has reached a level of self-sufficiency, a global relationship manager should take on the role of global client liaison.</p>
<h5 id="which-card-innovations-are-clients-most-interested-in-today">Which card innovations are clients most interested in today?</h5>
<p>Aside from the international currency cards, single-use accounts (SUA) are becoming increasingly popular. An SUA is an application which generates single-use numbers (virtual account numbers) with enhanced controls for transactions when the cardholder is not present. Controls can be set for key factors such as the size of the transaction, merchant name and category, currency, location and even date and time. The main benefits of SUAs for clients include increased control, reduced fraud exposure, the ability to capture enhanced data and a paperless solution.</p>
<p>As the P-Card market is not terribly mature on a global level, clients are also interested in combining T&amp;E and purchasing cards into a single multi-card solution. This solution helps to provide standardisation on a global level. Development of third-party or scheme data matching solutions can also help to reduce reliance on the card network and supplier capabilities to pass traditional P-Card data.</p>
<p>Using one platform for both T&amp;E and P-Cards, firms can leverage a card solution that is consistent across borders for consolidation, rebate and leverage opportunities.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="internal-challenges">Internal challenges</h4>
<p>Perhaps the biggest challenge for many companies is their ability to mandate participation in a T&amp;E card programme across their business groups and geographies. For a variety of organisational and structural reasons, most companies currently have difficulty mandating firm-wide participation; as a result, adoption tends to be by business unit. In turn, this means that standardisation can be difficult to achieve on a global or even regional level.</p>
<p>“A thorough, detailed and carefully planned approach of selecting your provider is essential to maximise the chances of adoption across the company,” says Luzio. In order to minimise complexities, most multinational firms find that identifying one partner to manage the company’s card programme can deliver consistency and simplicity over the long-term. Companies should also look to a provider who can deliver what they require from a holistic treasury and finance point of view. But how can global cards be supported in local markets?</p>
<h4 id="industry-solutions">Industry solutions</h4>
<p>Outside of self-issuance in local currency in every market and country, a popular cross-border card solution is the international currency card. Most frequently US dollar or euro-denominated, these cards recognise that clients do not always require local currency in the jurisdiction they are operating in. The main criterion is having a card that is accepted locally, and international currency cards are widely accepted throughout the Middle East and in Latin America for example, as well as countries such as Russia. As Luzio points out, “These cards are also useful in a country where the client may not feel comfortable working with a local issuer, perhaps because of political or economic instability in the region or they may prefer a consolidated global banking relationship, working with a single issuer. The client still needs a functioning card, access to data and reporting and the international currency card can fulfil that role.”</p>
<p>Conversely, some companies are seeking local currency cards to complete a global card programme. Swiss franc-denominated cards are becoming increasingly sought after as companies relocate their corporate or regional headquarters to Switzerland, for example. Global issuers therefore need to step outside of their comfort zones and address the needs of their clients. “It’s one thing to be global,” says Luzio, “but the key is to think and act local.”</p>
<h3 id="looking-to-the-future">Looking to the future</h3>
<p>“The trend towards globalisation is widely expected to continue as a result of the focus on the reduction of back-office and operational costs,” says Luzio. In turn, this is expected to drive greater demand for consistent global procurement tools, including card programmes. Additional factors driving the popularity of card programmes going includes the proliferation of internet enabled devices (smartphones, PDAs etc), which will allow access to transaction data on the move and help companies to cater for a globally mobile cardholder population. Regulation, such as SEPA and the PSD, which is likely to offer enhanced security for the end-user, together with the expansion of chip and pin schemes globally, is also expected to drive corporate demand for card programmes going forward.</p>
<p>A successful card programme requires collaboration, not only within the company, but externally, with trading partners and banking partners. So, choosing the right global card provider is therefore a key task for corporates. To ensure the provider can meet global needs now and in the future, look for a provider who invests consistently in up-to-date products, leveraging the latest technology, who has a pipeline of proven products and can provide superior web-based management tools. Lastly, look for a provider who offers global support and coverage in all key economies.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Over the past two years, tough economic conditions have forced treasurers to adopt a ‘back to basics’ approach to treasury management, tapping all possible internal sources of funding. Now is the time for treasurers to take the next step and start positioning their organisations for growth. Can further internal efficiencies help achieve this goal? In this Business Briefing we look at the relevance of DSO (days sales outstanding) and achieving efficiency in the order-to-cash cycle to source funding in a post-crisis environment.</p>
<h3 id="a-different-approach">A different approach</h3>
<p>With credit likely to remain scarce – and expensive – identifying alternate sources of internal funding remains a priority for organisations worldwide.</p>
<p>So what options are available? The sale of assets or the cutting of dividends are certainly examples of alternate sources, but working capital management (WCM) has probably become recognised as one of the most lucrative and sustainable methods of internal funding. WCM has also seen the treasurer’s role expand to an integral partner of the commercial business. But where should the treasurer be looking to unlock the next layer of trapped liquidity?</p>
<h3 id="dpo-is-yesterdays-news">DPO is yesterday’s news</h3>
<p>Before the financial crisis hit, organisations focused on the internal processes that were immediately controllable. First in line was DPO (days payable outstanding). Streamlining and optimising payables became the treasurer’s mantra, together with a focus on straight through processing (STP).</p>
<p>While DPO and STP remain integral to achieving internal efficiencies, these efforts alone do not provide a complete WCM solution. With STP rates often nearing 98%, treasurers need to understand that the internal efficiency gains from DPO are all but exhausted and that there are new sources to be explored.</p>
<p>The time has therefore come to shift the thinking from P2P (procure-to-pay) to O2C (order-to-cash), from DPO to DSO (days sales outstanding) and from STP to STR (straight through reconciliation).</p>
<div class="boxed">
<h4 id="stp-to-str">STP to STR</h4>
<p>Straight through processing is a commonly used measure of success across the global treasury community. However, STP usually focuses on corporate-to-bank flows or the sending of payments (or direct debits) in an automated fashion with limited – or no – focus on the bank-to-corporate flows. To achieve end-to-end efficiency requires a move beyond STP to STR, where all flows to the corporate including payment rejects/returns, reconciliation of balances and incoming transactions or collections are automated. STR steps in to fill the current gaps on bank-to-corporate flows automating both financial and operational reconciliation, providing a more complete measure of success.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="dso-and-its-impact-on-working-capital">DSO and its impact on working capital</h4>
<p>Unlike DPO, DSO – the average number of days taken by a company to collect payment from a completed sale – is still a largely untapped source of internal funding. Poor receivables management is reflected in high DSO and affects a company’s ability to access internal funding sources. In other words, the longer it takes for a payment to be collected, processed, matched and applied, the longer it is until that cash can be used for other purposes or until the credit lines can be freed up and the next sale or shipment made to the customer. Addressing DSO is therefore an achievable way of taking the efficiency agenda to the next level.</p>
<figure class="center">

</figure>
<p>So why wasn’t DSO first in line to be controlled? The processes involved often belong to multiple departments and are therefore harder to monitor and influence. That said, the hard work does pay off, in particular in industries with complex supply chains and global operations.</p>
<p>An analysis of Citi’s top 3,000 global companies around the world shows that these customers have, on average, $1.3 billion in trapped internal working capital which could be unlocked by reducing their DSO to within the median range for their industry.</p>
<p>Across sectors, there is sometimes a discrepancy of over 150 days between the ‘best’ (shortest) and ‘worst’ (longest) DSO. This large discrepancy means that many companies have significant room for improvement.</p>
<p>While these improvements look attractive – and simple – on paper, achieving them requires dedication and determination.</p>
<h3 id="order-to-cash-the-challenge">Order-to-cash: the challenge</h3>
<p>One of the hardest parts of tackling DSO is that it has to be done cross-functionally. In other words, some of the processes in the order-to-cash cycle are outside of the full control of treasury, either in the hands of other departments, or, crucially, with the customer. DSO is also subject to other external influences – particularly between markets/countries – in terms of the collection instruments commonly available and also the collections culture. In Italy for instance, DSO is typically 30 days longer than in Ireland, mainly because Italian companies view long collection windows as standard.</p>
<p>These factors alone, or in combination, may lead to disconnects or inefficiencies in the cycle, which will ultimately have a detrimental effect on the efficiency of the company’s working capital – possibly even creating a need for external funding.</p>
<p>So where are the main DSO pain points that are causing breakdowns late in the cycle, what are they and how can they be addressed?</p>

<h4 id="pain-points">Pain points</h4>
<p>Unfortunately for treasury, pain points exist all along the order-to-cash cycle. However, three of the most commonly identified areas of ‘pain’ are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Multiple collection types.</h5>
<p>There is currently no best practice around collection instruments. Not only is there variation from industry to industry, but also from country to country. While SEPA is aiming to make improvements in this space, there is still no common collection method. The channels vary from cash picked up by a ‘man in a van’ in some markets, to cheques, or to the more advanced electronic means such as electronic transfers or direct debits.</p>
<p>Proliferation in instruments leads to multiple output channels, which means increased manual reconciliation tasks and therefore increased margin for error. This leaves DSO vulnerable to significant increases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Lack of remittance data.</h5>
<p>If accounts receivable (AR) matching is carried out manually at an entity level, lack of remittance data is often not such a prominent challenge as there are far fewer payments to marry up. At an SSC level, however, where there may be thousands of payments, many from accounts with similar references or codes, the real importance of remittance data can be seen. With truncated data on the receipts, receivables matching becomes an extremely time consuming task.</p>
<p>This is exacerbated by customers sending, for instance, one payment to settle several invoices, partial payments, or on occasion, overpayments. Without full remittance data for these exceptions, DSO begins to soar as investigation work is required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Non-system readable data.</h5>
<p>Delivery of better information alone does not, in itself, however, enable operational reconciliation if the systems being used by a company are not able to handle the information. If collections and rejected/returned items are not automatically driven through to all the downstream workflows, the manual labour to reconcile and apply a payment to an AR open item is high – as are the hidden costs.</p>
</li>

<img alt="Newell Rubbermaid logo" class="logo" height="22" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/newell-rubbermaid-brands-that-matter-logo-2010-120x22.png" title="Newell Rubbermaid" width="120"/>
</div>
<p class="management-summary">S&amp;P 500-constituent Newell Rubbermaid is a global marketer of leading consumer and commercial products with sales of around $5.6 billion in 2009.</p>
<h5 id="the-challenge">The challenge</h5>
<p>Following a series of mergers and acquisitions, Newell Rubbermaid maintained 190 accounts with 22 different banks resulting in a large number of manual processes, few economies of scale and limited control. The company decided to centralise the accounts payable, accounts receivable and general ledger functions into a Shared Service Centre (SSC) in The Netherlands. In order to benefit from economies of scale, the company also recognised that it needed to rationalise its bank structure.</p>
<p>In the first quarter of 2007, Newell Rubbermaid issued a RFP with the objective of finding a single banking partner for payments and collections across 22 countries in EMEA (excluding the UK). One of the company’s most important criteria for selecting a partner was the bank’s capability to manage local collections, especially domestic instruments, as well as payments in each market. “Accounts receivable were a key consideration because while Newell Rubbermaid can determine how it pays its suppliers, customers inevitably determine local collection methods,” explains Jérôme Miara, European Treasurer.</p>
<h5 id="the-solution">The solution</h5>
<p>Citi’s proposal envisaged that starting in 2007 and finishing in mid-2009, 126 Citibank accounts would be opened for Newell Rubbermaid’s 54 different legal entities across EMEA. Payments would be made using Citi’s state-of-the-art platform for file transmission and translation, Citi<sup>®</sup> File Xchange, and the web-based banking platform CitiDirect<sup>®</sup> Online Banking. Domestic solutions would be implemented in each country to support the local entities’ requirements, including the use of instruments such as LCRs, RIBAs and Pagares. A pan-European lockbox for cheques would be established.</p>
<h5 id="the-result">The result</h5>
<p>Citi was selected to become Newell Rubbermaid’s partner in EMEA (excluding the UK) in the second quarter of 2007. “The bank’s geographic footprint is unique and is made up of fully owned branches – we didn’t want to introduce complexity arising from additional local partners,” says Miara. The Citi bank accounts were opened in phases as planned and in parallel, Newell Rubbermaid closed 148 legacy bank accounts and exited 17 non-strategic bank relationships. The simplification of Newell Rubbermaid’s bank structure in EMEA has delivered a wide range of benefits. “We have gained control and visibility through the use of a single centrally-controlled internet banking platform,” says Miara. Increased visibility of its order-to-cash cycle processes has helped the company to improve decision-making, reduce credit risk and enhance working capital management</p>
<p>Newell Rubbermaid has also gained numerous benefits from increased automation: a single interface has been set-up with the company’s Movex ERP from which payment and collection files can be submitted directly. It uses one inbound file for the upload and automated cash application of its accounts receivable balances using GetPaid software. Consequently, manual processes have been reduced and treasury staff have been redeployed to value-added tasks. At the same time, the rationalised bank structure has helped Newell Rubbermaid to gain efficiencies in the order-to-cash cycle which contributed to an improvement in DSO. The company has used the project as an opportunity to harmonise its banking processes, enabling the migration of accounts payable and receivable and general ledger processes to its European SSC – something that would have been more difficult without account rationalisation. It will also facilitate a forthcoming move to SAP. “Our streamlined structure as a result of this project will make the process easier,” says Miara.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="easing-the-pain">Easing the pain</h3>
<p>It is unlikely that receivables management will ever be 100% perfect: not everyone will pay electronically, remittance data won’t necessarily be complete and there will always be exceptions that need to be handled manually,” says Francyn Stuckey, Client Sales Management, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Global Transaction Services, Citi. “However, there are many solutions that banks can offer, ranging from the basic to the sophisticated, that can help companies improve receivables management, drive STR and optimise DSO.”</p>
<p>Citi has identified four stages where it can assist its clients in achieving optimum levels of efficiency and automation:</p>
<figure class="center">
<figcaption>
<h5 id="figure-3-receivables-cash-application">Figure 3: Receivables – cash application</h5>
</figcaption>
<a class="enlargeable" href="http://treasurytoday.com/i/2010/04/2010-04-tt-12-bb-diagram-03-receivables-cash-application.png"><img alt="Figure 3: Receivables – cash application" height="179" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/2010/04/2010-04-tt-12-bb-diagram-03-receivables-cash-application-t.png" width="300"/></a>
</figure>
<h5 id="dematerialisation">Dematerialisation</h5>
<p>Moving away from paper-based collection instruments is the first step to achieving system-readable, comprehensive data. To some companies this may suggest that investment will be needed in their technology infrastructure, but in fact companies may benefit more by using the financial outlay to provide incentives for their customers to use direct debits or other forms of electronic payments.</p>
<p>The use of electronic payments, electronic invoice presentment and payment (EIPP) will also help eliminate paper earlier in the order-to-cash cycle and improve remittance capture. Companies will, however, need to take into account the markets in which they are operating as it is not always achievable – or indeed permissible – to move away from paper instruments. An initial focus on largely ‘electronic’ markets will give quick rewards.</p>
<h5 id="electronification">Electronification</h5>
<p>The second step is to move away from paper-based reconciliation to electronic delivery and a system-based (ie ERP/TMS) matching process. It is at this stage that banks can add real value by enhancing and standardising the data that they provide to the client. In addition to advanced techniques, data enhancement can be done by using existing services in a smarter way. For example, lockboxes can be used as a way of gathering remittances for all payments, which are then further enriched by the banks to ensure all data is passed on to the client in an ERP/TMS readable format.</p>
<h5 id="integrated-matching">Integrated matching</h5>
<p>Using receivables solutions that are integrated into the company’s ERP/TMS is vital to achieving STR. However, standard solutions do not address the problems of multiple data sources and incomplete remittance data. Advanced techniques, such as automated account reconciliation reports which deliver enriched information for all collections – both paper and electronic – based on set algorithms and customer data, do help address these problems, thus reducing the effort and the associated costs of manual intervention. Virtual accounts are another technique to help solve the challenge of insufficient remittance data.</p>
<h5 id="best-in-class">Best in class</h5>
<p>The final step is to become ‘best in class’. At this point in time, the only manual reconciliation that should be carried out is for exception handling, at which point business process outsourcing can be introduced to manage these AR exceptions. Regardless of whether corporates opt to take this step, they should still be looking to fully leverage their bank’s AR offering in order to achieve the final percentage points of STR and to maximise impact on their DSO.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>While addressing receivables management may seem daunting, the size of the reward is commensurate with the effort required, as Karin Flinspach, EMEA Receivables Head, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi, explains, “Often treasurers don’t feel empowered to interfere with the sales organisation and the client’s payment behaviour. However with the renewed focus on working capital and its significant contribution to the net margin of the company, the treasurer can seize the opportunity to get buy in from the top of the organisation to force wide reaching changes in the order-to-cash cycle, thus achieving huge efficiencies.”</p>
<p>The significance of these efficiencies should not be underestimated. After all, it is not just a question of unlocking trapped working capital. There is the potential to bring down full time employee costs through improved automation, for instance, IT costs can also be reduced and operational efficiencies ranging from harmonisation of reporting to improved AR accounting can also be achieved. Together, these efficiencies will be instrumental in positioning companies for growth in the post-crisis environment.</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p>The corporate prepaid card market is already a success story in the US and there is significant and growing interest throughout Europe in the potential benefits that this product can bring to private and public organisations, with some interesting solutions beginning to emerge. In this Product Profile we examine Citi’s prepaid card solutions and give an overview of the wide range of applications offered by this product.</p>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Over the past decade, a revolution has started to take shape around the emergence of electronic payments, replacing antiquated paper cheques and the inefficient, expensive processes and resources they demand. This shift, together with a move towards more environmentally-friendly, paperless solutions, has resulted in an increasing number of public and private sector organisations adopting prepaid solutions for a wide array of payment applications.</p>
<p>Already a success story in the United States market, corporate prepaid programmes have been used in a number of industries with a variety of applications. Organisations are benefiting not only from faster, more dependable payments, but also from dramatically reduced costs and enhanced efficiencies. These improvements are not finance specific however, and have the potential to impact many different departments across the organisation.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-prepaid-cards">What are prepaid cards?</h3>
<p>Prepaid cards allow users to access, within limits, a pre-funded pool of capital, meaning that payment essentially precedes purchase. Whereas a credit card, for example, allows the user to make a purchase first and pay later, a prepaid card requires payment before any purchase is made. In the corporate and government space, prepaid cards can act as a convincing replacement for paper based payments such as cheques, cash and vouchers. They can also be used to eliminate paper statements, for example, from an organisation’s payment process for faster, cheaper and more efficient electronic payments.</p>
<p>Prepaid cards can be loaded with one-time or multiple payments, with value stored on a remote server rather than on the card itself. Recently a wide range of applications has been developed and the potential for using prepaid cards in the corporate and government context is beginning to be realised.</p>
<h3 id="citi-prepaid-services">Citi<sup>®</sup> Prepaid Services</h3>
<p>The prepaid programmes offered by Citi<sup>®</sup> Prepaid Services provide recipients with an electronic account which can be loaded with single or recurring payments from an organisation. These could be payments made for a variety of reasons, including benefits, incentives, compensation, rebates, emergency relief, claims, refunds, rewards, and more. From this account, funds can easily be accessed by the recipient via a variety of methods that include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Purchases using the prepaid card (eg retail, phone, online).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ATM cash access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bank branch cash advance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bank fund transfers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cheque.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At the heart of this funds access is a Visa<sup>®</sup> prepaid card, which can be fully customised with the organisation’s brand and messaging. This card looks and fundamentally works like a credit card for purchases, but the prepaid card has no credit line and can only be used for an amount up to and not exceeding the balance paid into the account.</p>
<p>A personalised prepaid card allows the recipient to purchase items or services at millions of retail locations, by phone or online. The card can also provide optional ATM cash access or bank branch cash advance functionality.</p>
<h4 id="the-benefits">The benefits</h4>
<p>One of the major benefits of Citi’s prepaid solution is that organisations can provide accounts to cardholders without requiring a credit check, review of bank accounts or burdensome applications. This allows an organisation to take advantage of its programme on a widespread basis, thus leveraging the cost saving benefits associated with the elimination of paper, along with the substantial resources typically required to produce and distribute cheques.</p>
<h5 id="cardholder-benefits">Cardholder benefits</h5>
<p>Aside from their organisational benefits, personalised prepaid cards provide valuable cardholder benefits as well. Payment recipients, whether beneficiaries, citizens, employees, sales professionals or customers, can benefit from the flexible fund access choices, convenience and security associated with this type of solution.</p>
<h5 id="website">Website</h5>
<p>In addition, a Citi<sup>®</sup> Prepaid Services programme offers cardholders access to a fully customised website that can be used to manage their accounts, view their transactions and payments, check their fund balance and get assistance.</p>
<p>This website also provides a direct communication channel for the organisation to deliver important information and updates to cardholders. Cardholders may register for account activity and balance alerts delivered direct to their email or mobile phone via text message for added control of their funds.</p>

<h4 id="across-the-organisation">Across the organisation</h4>
<p>As financial departments look for ways to enhance their cost and operational structures, an increasing number of treasury groups are adopting corporate prepaid solutions, and the electronic payments they provide, to reduce administrative costs, build operational efficiencies and gain greater visibility into their payment programmes through enhanced reporting and tracking.</p>
<p>Citi<sup>®</sup> Prepaid Services reports that most clients who use prepaid solutions tend to have forward-thinking treasury groups. These groups often take a progressive approach to their solutions, looking to implement Citi’s prepaid programmes across their organisation in order to provide benefits for a variety of departments, while achieving their own goals of cost reduction and improved operational efficiency on a significant scale. For many clients, the treasury group is serving as a champion, introducing the benefits of programme adoption to each department, while also helping management to understand the gains that prepaid programmes can bring to the entire organisation.</p>
<p>Prepaid cards can be used for payments in areas such as payroll, sales incentives, employee rewards and consumer incentives (for example, ‘buy this camera and receive €50 cash back’). Consequently the following departments may benefit from prepaid solutions:</p>

<h5 id="what-makes-citis-offering-unique">What makes Citi’s offering unique?</h5>
<p>There are a number of things. First of all, we are actually able to offer this type of turnkey solution, which not many banks can do. Ours is a corporate payment solution, which means our platform is built based on 11 years’ experience in the corporate and government prepaid card industry. Due to the size of our operation we can confidently manage even the largest government programmes, potentially involving millions of beneficiaries.</p>
<p>The thing that really makes us unique, however, is our global positioning. Our programmes are offered on a global platform, which has the same look and feel across all markets but in line with local legal and language requirements. We are able to support multiple currencies and we can issue cards into multiple markets.</p>
<p>Right now we are live in numerous markets including Canada and the US and we are going live in the UK this month, followed by other European markets throughout 2009.</p>
<h5 id="where-is-the-treasurer-involved">Where is the treasurer involved?</h5>
<p>Treasury drives cost savings across the organisation. So when we save 50-80% of their paper-based processing costs by converting payments to prepaid cards, the treasurer is the key stakeholder in that and the key driving force. There is always a very positive impact to treasury in terms of cost savings and automating payments etc, but the key impact and benefits of a prepaid card programme are felt by sales, marketing and HR, depending on the type of programme in question. The treasurer frequently manages the relationship with us, so we need their help to explain the benefits of the product to the key stakeholders across the other payment flows.</p>
<h5 id="what-sort-of-take-up-are-you-seeing">What sort of take up are you seeing?</h5>
<p>We are expecting a large take up, across all sectors. There’s really not a single sector that doesn’t have a need for this product. The larger the corporate, the more applicable it can be.</p>
<p>This area is enormously busy right now. Everybody is waking up to the possibilities and more and more of our clients are asking about it. In the UK we also experience a growing demand by governments and local councils who are looking for automated ways to pay the unbanked or people for whom they don’t have banking details. This could be anything from pension payments, benefit payments and other government disbursements – generally these are cash, voucher and cheque based payments.</p>

<p>Little to no development, reduced administrative resources.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="payroll">Payroll</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Faster, more dependable payroll delivery, for example for unbanked employees or during natural disasters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhanced, streamlined process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dramatically reduced costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Greater employee satisfaction, reduced turnover.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="security">Security</h4>
<p>Usually cards will need to be activated once received by telephoning a dedicated contact centre and answering a couple of questions – these may include the card number and the beneficiary’s date of birth, employee or customer reference number, depending on the type of card.</p>
<p>Other security features include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The website accessed by the beneficiary is password protected and the beneficiary must answer security questions the first time the website is accessed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a card is lost or stolen, the beneficiary is protected. The money is not held on the card itself but on the server and it is therefore simple to cancel the lost card and send a replacement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depending on the market, the cards may also incorporate security features such as ‘chip and pin’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every transaction must be authorised by Citi online and only the money loaded to the card can be spent. The card cannot go into negative balance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="global-expansion">Global expansion</h4>
<p>Following its success in the United States, Citi<sup>®</sup> Prepaid Services is expanding into Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Citi Prepaid’s offering in these regions will be tailored to public and private sector organisations that are looking to dramatically reduce costs, streamline their operations and enhance the payment delivery process for their recipients.</p>
<p>Citi Prepaid will offer local corporates economical and efficient implementation that requires minimal resources. The implementation process is designed to be rapid and not disruptive to existing payment channels, with the beneficiary being able to use the prepaid cards within six to 12 weeks of adopting Citi Prepaid.</p>
<p>In addition, support from Citi Prepaid experts will be at hand for both clients and cardholders. “We work with companies in nearly every major industry,” says Thore Vestergaard, EMEA Market Manager, Citi<sup>®</sup> Prepaid Services. “We are very used to doing this.”</p>
<h4 id="education">Education</h4>
<p>Vestergaard advises that when implementing a prepaid card programme, education is key. This is particularly true in the area of payroll and social benefit payments, as changes to the way in salaries and benefits are paid have enormous emotional resonance for individuals. Citi works closely with corporates to develop an education programme, ensuring that the employees affected have adequate advanced warning that the change will be taking place. This might take the form of a document explaining when the change will be taking place, what the implications are and advice on how to open a bank account if employees do not wish to be paid by card.</p>
<h4 id="impact-beyond-the-business">Impact beyond the business</h4>
<p>Rolling out electronic payments across an organisation via prepaid solutions will help achieve greater payment operational efficiencies and cost reductions. The prepaid programme also provides a ‘green’, paperless, environmental initiative, benefiting not only the organisation and recipients, but also the environment.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The area of corporate and government prepaid cards has achieved substantial growth in the US market in recent years. While the European prepaid market is less mature, the potential for this type of product is impressive and is already beginning to be realised.</p>
<p>Citi<sup>®</sup> Prepaid Services has harnessed much of the versatility associated with prepaid cards and already offers a wide range of cards to corporates and governments, with a firm focus on delivering a customised solution. It will be interesting to see how this area develops as Citi expands its offering across Europe in the next year.</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p>With recent events transforming the banking industry, corporates can be forgiven for focusing their attention on liquidity rather than on questions such as if, how and when they should be considering joining the SWIFT network. In the wake of events including the collapse of Lehman Brothers, LloydsTSB’s acquisition of HBOS and the decision by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to lose their investment bank status, corporates are more focused than ever on optimising their own liquidity. Although maintaining sufficient bank relationships is a key aspect of this, treasurers are also considering how liquidity can be maximised through solid cash management processes.</p>
<h3 id="changing-priorities-in-a-changing-world">Changing priorities in a changing world</h3>
<p>Corporate treasurers continue to place a high priority on the rationalisation of bank accounts. In the current environment, this needs to be balanced against the availability of funding.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they are focusing their efforts on maximising their own liquidity through solid cash and treasury management processes. Many corporate treasurers are going back to the basics of concentrating on receiving timely and accurate bank account information globally, visibility, transaction execution and their other core responsibilities within the treasury function. This often includes the establishment of payment and/or collection factories and shared service centres to realise economies of scale, drive automation and improve the order to cash/purchase-to-pay processes.</p>
<p>When companies embark upon this re-engineering journey there are a number of factors to consider:</p>

<p>In this Business Briefing we look at how the outsourcing challenge can be applied to a commodity such as core payments processing. We also consider how this may provide a path to full business process outsourcing (BPO) using SWIFT as one, but not the only, enabler.</p>
<h4 id="the-swift-approach">The SWIFT approach</h4>
<p>If we revisit the subject of corporate access to SWIFT, we can begin to see how SWIFT can become the enabler to achieving many of these objectives. After all, some 350+ corporates are already accessing SWIFT either directly or indirectly and this number is set to increase as SWIFT makes it easier and cheaper to access its network.</p>
<p>SWIFT has plans to improve the standardisation of messaging and processes including the new Bank Account Mandate (BAM) process, ISO20022 and exceptions and investigations. It also plans to implement trade finance messages and enhance its existing FIN message type. It has launched a new interface product, Alliance Lite, targeted at the mid-market enterprise which provides access to SWIFT over the internet via a USB stick. There are significant opportunities for the banks to harness these developments in partnership with SWIFT, to leverage the introduction of SEPA (Credit Transfer and Direct Debit) and the Payments Services Directive (PSD) for the benefit of their corporate clients as they look to re engineer their processes.</p>

<h3 id="outsourcing">Outsourcing</h3>
<p>Connectivity alone is not enough, however. Many banks today are reviewing how they leverage the different access options, their own solutions and use of ‘best of breed’ technology partners to deliver real value-added solutions to their clients with outsourcing a possible option.</p>
<p>Outsourcing is defined as subcontracting a process, such as product design or manufacturing, to a third-party. The decision to outsource is often made in the interest of reducing costs, redirecting or conserving energy directed at the competencies of a particular business, or to make more efficient use of resources. Outsourcing has been part of the business lexicon for well over 20 years and is certainly not an uncommon term in the world of corporate treasury operations.</p>
<p>However, the word outsourcing usually sets emotions running high within businesses of all shapes and sizes as those undertaking the processes/tasks identified to be outsourced often feel threatened – and for good reason. Outsourcing has historically resulted in those cost reductions referred to above being realised through job losses in many cases. The journey along the outsourcing road is a difficult one and the corporate treasury environment has not been immune over the last 20 years.</p>
<p>During this period we have witnessed a number of examples of outsourcing, ranging from a simple case of foreign exchange transactions to agency banking, automated cash pooling and the full blown outsourcing of the entire treasury function. Service providers are increasingly looking at innovative ways to harness their processing and transactional execution expertise, size, coverage and scale to deliver real value to their customers.</p>
<h4 id="drivers-for-outsource-providers">Drivers for outsource providers</h4>
<p>Any change in strategy on the part of the service providers looking to win a slice of this business usually starts with a review of the key drivers and aims. By understanding these, treasurers may in turn have a better understanding of the types of product on offer. The following therefore lists these drivers from the outsource provider’s perspective.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A desire to grow business via its front-office.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Globalisation and leverage enhanced product offerings such as global liquidity solutions, SEPA and SWIFT connectivity for corporates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A reduction in back-office costs by leveraging scale as a major payments processor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A technology refresh utilising ‘best in breed’ partners for back-office payments processing and improved integration with corporate back office systems architecture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alignment with regulatory compliance/KYC and other external factors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A wish to rationalise its own relationships.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-does-the-outsource-solution-need-to-cover">What does the outsource solution need to cover?</h4>
<p>Any decision to outsource will obviously need to deliver tangible improvement on what is being done today; a positive ROI is essential. Companies looking at these issues often share common characteristics and needs. Many organisations today accept they need the banks as an intrinsic component of the final solution and they share very similar needs in terms of systems connectivity and integration. These are a key part of the final product delivered. In response, service providers are beginning to develop solutions which really do address these requirements and deliver quantifiable benefits to their clients.</p>
<h3 id="hsbcs-solution">HSBC’s solution</h3>
<p>HSBC has developed a proposition defined as ‘Payments Managed Services’. This provides a variety of connectivity options within a secure environment and interfaces with the systems of HSBC’s clients.</p>
<p>The solution provides a multi-bank proposition via the SWIFT network with automated linkages to the various payment/clearing systems. It also offers a completely managed, and modular, service including data capture and transformation, limit checking, anti-money laundering screening, wire and ACH payments, warehousing, intra-day reconciliation and liquidity management all via a single provider. This model has the potential to grow where the client can ‘pay as they go’ and ‘pay as they grow’ as additional services can be included within the managed services framework.</p>
<figure class="center">

<a class="enlargeable" href="http://treasurytoday.com/i/2008/10/2008-10-tt-09-bb-diagram-03-the-hsbc-payments-managed-service.png"><img alt="Diagram 3: The HSBC Payments Managed Service" height="182" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/2008/10/2008-10-tt-09-bb-diagram-03-the-hsbc-payments-managed-service-t.png" width="300"/></a>

<p>In setting up in-house banks, corporates are able to process all payments from central bank accounts on behalf of multiple subsidiaries. Integrated within the HSBC solution is a market leading Treasury Management System. The TMS supports all in-house banking features, including intercompany funding, intercompany netting and in-house bank accounting entries.</p>
<p>Commercially, all of this is offered as a bundled solution via a single contract with HSBC, whilst minimising the need for capital expenditure on the part of the client. HSBC believes this is laying the foundation for a full business process outsourcing solution.</p>
<div class="boxed">
<h3 id="standard-bank-offshore-group">Standard Bank Offshore Group</h3>
<p>Approximately 25,000 clients – with 40,000 accounts and a deposit base of £2.1 billion – are handled by Standard Bank Offshore Group Limited. The company wished to improve its efficiency and STP rates, reduce operational risks, eliminate manual processes and reduce costs. In order to achieve this, following an RFP process, SBOG turned to HSBC.</p>
<p>HSBC was able to provide a solution that encompassed full management of SBOG’s global nostro account structure through a single portal capable of providing global payments, collection, reconciliation, real-time monitoring and full AML compliance capability. The solution also included the use of a SWIFT service bureau that provides an environment to improve straight through processing and reconciliation. Integral to meeting the requirements of SBOG was the chosen provider’s ability to deliver complete cheque book ordering and printing management, the outsourcing of cheque stops and returns, and both domestic and foreign cheque collections. These obligations were fulfilled through a combination of the bank’s own products and key third-party suppliers. Furthermore, the bank’s solution involved packaging inward and outward clearing solutions including deployment of the bank’s internet platform, implementation of electronic solutions for Bacs, multi-currency cheque outsourcing, agency clearing via SWIFTNet FileAct and the use of SWIFTNet FIN to support payments across accounts in 23 currencies for which the bank is acting as SBOG’s settlement agent. The provider is also responsible for managing SBOG’s SWIFT interface and infrastructure and managing/mapping data flows to the SBOG back office to achieve full reconciliation and exception reporting.</p>
<p>Jonathan Reynolds, Director – Operations at SBOG says, “I can advise that in the past year the volumes of our incoming payments have increased by 27% and volumes for UK clearing have increased by 8%. Prior to implementation of the outsource partnership, these activities were handled manually and the increases would have resulted in a significant increase in headcount. However, this has not been necessary due to the outsource service.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, the outsource service has enabled us to capitalise on our partner’s capability for the routing of payments and negated the necessity for us to either utilise a further payment routing application which, for the volume of our traffic, would have proven difficult to justify on a cost-benefit basis, or ensure all staff responsible for payment capture are sufficiently proficient in the complexities of international payments. We are now able to visit a change to our operating model, putting the capture of client instructions closer to the point of receipt and the staff who have the day-to-day contact with our clients.</p>
<p>A further benefit of the outsource service has been the removal of the need to manage and maintain our SWIFT connection. Whilst some activity is still required when SWIFT updates its packages, this is considerably less than when we were directly responsible for our own connection and software.</p>
<p>In summary, the outsource service has enabled SBOG, in its payment activities, to enjoy and offer the benefits of a large global bank whilst focusing on service delivery to its clients in its chosen key areas of expertise.”</p>
</div>
<h3 id="the-business-case">The business case</h3>
<p>Most decisions to incur any major expenditure will normally require a business case to proceed and outsourcing is no different. The decision on the solution detailed above will focus upon two options; installed or ‘in-house’ solution versus the outsourced or managed service.</p>
<p>The in-house solution will need to consider the following components: -</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Computer operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintenance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Software licences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hardware and operating systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disaster recovery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Human Resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depreciation of capital and equipment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast to the above, the outsourced option requires a sign-on and annual service fee which can be combined with all costs spread over the life of the contract. The outsource solution effectively becomes a pay as you go option with reduced investment and a greatly improved return on that investment.</p>
<h3 id="benefits">Benefits</h3>
<p>The benefits of migrating processes to the model described above can be summarised as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reduction in initial and ongoing costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elimination of in-house software and licensing fees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elimination of in-house value added software application costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elimination of ongoing development and project costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduction in support maintenance costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced operational costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provides enhanced speed to market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Costs spread over the life of the contract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Full access to best of breed banking services.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Solutions such as HSBC’s may also bring the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Future proof outsource solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compliant with regulatory and SEPA rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scaleable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bureau hosted in fail-safe 24/7 dual data centres.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SWIFT used as a secure delivery channel or other secure FTP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Full transaction audit trails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Variable cost model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All contracting is undertaken with the service provider.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The decision to outsource is a delicate one. Service providers are moving away from using the word outsourcing to avoid misinterpretation. This is more about delivering real value to their clients and HSBC, for example, has decided on a proposition which uses best in breed components and puts the client at the heart of the solution. It also positions the bank to expand this model by including additional services through an enhanced Application Service Provider (ASP) proposition within the bureau offering – effectively a ‘one-stop shop’ with HSBC.</p>
<p>In essence, these types of solutions put connectivity to work for the client. This modular type approach, using best in class components, allows the client to build out from a foundation of SWIFT connectivity to include: data mapping from/to legacy back office formats; overnight, intraday or real-time reconciliations and exception reporting; filtering and capture of payments against AML checklists; bulking of payments into cost-effective ACH-formatted files; use of SWIFTnet FIN and FileAct to connect to banking partners.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>The financial supply chain is increasingly being seen as one of the main shareholder value drivers. Reviewing invoicing and collections processes is an accessible way for companies to accelerate the cash conversion cycle and generate competitive advantage. In this Business Briefing we discuss the current trends in receivables and explore how partnering with banks could provide practical business solutions and enhance working capital management.</p>
<h3 id="reviewing-current-processes">Reviewing current processes</h3>
<p>The recent market turmoil has given treasurers another reason to focus on releasing trapped working capital and improving liquidity management. Reducing days sales outstanding (DSO) by negotiating shorter payment terms with customers is one method that can potentially release liquidity, but some of the largest latent savings can in fact be identified by reviewing – and improving – a company’s invoicing-to-cash cycle.</p>
<p>This can be done by making a detailed process description, from the receipt of an order to the sending of the invoice and collection. The process description can be drawn up with the help of consultants if required, or using internal resources.</p>
<p>Factors to consider in such a review include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How is the invoice produced – on paper or electronically?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the lead time on delivery of invoices?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are payments usually on time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What happens when a payment is overdue?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How are reminders or account statements sent?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This should help to identify where any bottlenecks might occur and ultimately where there might be room for optimisation. For example, companies may find that invoices are being held up in the bookkeeping system for several days or even weeks before being issued. Or invoices may contain errors, causing customers to query them and delaying the process further.</p>
<p>Once any such problem areas have been identified, the next step is to examine products and solutions which could be used to improve the collections process.</p>
<h3 id="addressing-inefficiencies">Addressing inefficiencies</h3>
<p>The main improvements in terms of working capital can normally be achieved by addressing the company’s internal processes and the choice of collection methods. There are many products and solutions available which can be used to make the collections process more efficient, such as:</p>
<h4 id="direct-debits">Direct debits</h4>
<p>Using a direct debit system together with an automated invoice matching system can reduce the resources involved in the invoicing-to-cash cycle – in terms of time, money and personnel – as the manual balancing of payments becomes obsolete. Installing a direct debit system can also improve liquidity planning as the company itself debits the money and, barring any setbacks, the payments arrive on time.</p>
<p>The use of direct debits will also enable the company to identify bad debts at an earlier stage as the bank will reject payments due to insufficient funds.</p>
<h5 id="sepa">SEPA</h5>
<p>The SEPA Direct Debit Scheme (SDD) is due to be implemented in 2009 and is likely to have a significant impact on corporates. With one set of rules and one format it will be considerably easier for corporate customers to use direct debit across the SEPA countries. However, a question mark remains over the level of acceptance of the SDD once it is launched, with many countries feeling that their existing direct debit systems offer a superior service.</p>
<h4 id="e-invoicing">E-invoicing</h4>
<p>E-invoicing is a process by which buyers and suppliers can exchange invoices and other financial information such as credit notes and purchase orders electronically. E-invoicing is designed to replace paper processes and facilitate real-time document management.</p>
<p>There are many benefits of using electronic invoicing, from the cost savings on paper, printing and postage to the possibilities of automating the invoicing process and not least cutting the lead time for invoicing. This, in turn, should result in quicker settlement and dispute resolution together with reduced data entry errors.</p>
<p>While the take-up of e-invoicing has been slower than many initially expected, it is now showing significant acceleration, with the total volume of e-invoices in Europe reaching 710m in 2007, 45% higher than the 490m sent in 2006. Adoption is greatest in the Nordic countries at 10%, with a more modest 2% reported in Western Europe.</p>
<p>Government support can play a key role in encouraging acceptance of e-invoicing. In Denmark, for example, development has been driven by the public sector, with the UBL format being adopted in favour of standards developed by local banks.</p>
<h4 id="outsourcing">Outsourcing</h4>
<p>Many companies still produce and dispatch their own invoices, even though this is not necessarily their area of expertise. Traditionally, paper invoices were incorporated in a company’s marketing spend but in today’s corporate world invoices are really only seen by the employees who process them. With this in mind, many companies have started to outsource their invoicing and collections processes.</p>
<h3 id="partnering-with-banks">Partnering with banks</h3>
<p>Banks have traditionally offered payment and cash management services. Most banks are also able to provide advice on working capital processes and can put forward off-the-shelf products that can effectively optimise working capital. However, in such a competitive marketplace, banks have to be increasingly forward-thinking and provide value added services.</p>
<h4 id="why-partner-with-a-bank">Why partner with a bank?</h4>
<p>Given the wide range of web-based technologies and improved payment methods now available, some of which we have highlighted above, some companies may be able to optimise their working capital through in-house drives alone. For other companies a partnership with a bank is a more attractive option. This may be the case for a variety of reasons, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>File formats and references.</h5>
<p>These vary between countries and payment systems, meaning that separate implementation methods and multiple interfaces may be required. Banks can offer conversion of collection files to the recipient’s preferred format and may also provide unique payment references, enabling the collection to be reconciled with the open account receivable more easily. This may in turn make it easier to identify and chase outstanding accounts receivable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Cost of upgrading systems.</h5>
<p>Implementing new systems and processes, such as centralising accounts receivable into a shared service centre, can be extremely expensive. By partnering with a bank, the company may avoid the need to revamp company systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Compliance issues.</h5>
<p>Sarbanes-Oxley, International Accounting Standards and other regulations are pushing companies to achieve greater control, transparency and visibility of the processes. Simplifying the collection processes lessens the burden on the internal audit team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Shortage of skilled staff.</h5>
<p>It can be difficult to find suitably qualified staff for specialist jobs such as accounts receivable, and costly to keep employees’ knowledge up-to-date. Banks have teams of experts at their disposal who are committed to delivering innovative value-creating solutions. Outsourcing such tasks may also enable staff to focus on more strategic activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Centralisation.</h5>
<p>If the company operates using a decentralised structure, its subsidiaries may manage their own receivables processes as well as their banking relationships. Outsourcing collections processes to a bank is an easy and cost-effective way of centralising them, thereby increasing visibility and control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Customer disruption.</h5>
<p>Revising invoicing procedures is a two-way process as customers need to agree to the new format proposed by the company selling the goods. Using a bank to convert formats allows one party to change their procedures without forcing the other to do the same, thus maintaining established relationships.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, formats and infrastructures in different countries may make it difficult for a company to improve collections in a market with which it is unfamiliar. By partnering with a bank that has expertise in such markets, these obstacles may be bypassed.</p>

<p class="management-summary">Codan is an insurance company which provides personal and commercial insurance products to customers in Denmark, Sweden and Norway. The company also has offices in Finland where it manages a navy portfolio. Owned by RSA, which has over 20m customers worldwide, Codan operates under several national brands, such as the Trygg-Hansa Insurance brand in Sweden.</p>
<p>Codan has recently launched ATAVA, a self-service internet insurance brand. This required the development of a system to manage internet communications for the brand. From the perspective of Peter Hansen, Codan’s Head of Payment Systems, the most important aspect of this was how internet payments were to be handled.</p>
<p>In order for the company to receive direct debit payments from customers in Sweden and Denmark, several options were considered. “We analysed setting up the interfaces ourselves,” says Hansen. “However, because of the different payment systems – AutoGiro in Sweden and PBS in Denmark – we would have needed to have different interfaces and processes in order to handle the direct debiting of our customers. In order to avoid this, we were looking for a system that would provide a single interface for both countries. We looked at several banks but none of their solutions was as simple as Danske Bank’s Collection Service. Therefore this was our chosen solution.”</p>
<p>Collection Service is an electronic solution which allows customers to manage the collection of direct debit payments in a range of countries using a single interface. Rather than working with different systems and different formats, the solution enables Codan to send and receive collection information in a single format.</p>
<p>As Hansen explains, “If the customer chooses to use direct debit, then we will send a message to Danske Bank, which will set up an agreement with PBS in Denmark or BGC, the local clearinghouse, in Sweden. This agreement can then be used for debiting our customer in the future. When we have something to debit, we just send another message to Danske Bank. We then receive notification that the customer has paid, as well as confirmation that the funds have been received in our bank account. The simplicity of the product is its biggest benefit.” Danske Bank also handles all the relevant contracts and communications with the local clearinghouse.</p>
<p>The solution was initially implemented in Sweden in June 2007 and the Danish collections were added in August 2008. Codan was able to draw on Danske Bank’s knowledge of the local markets to ensure a smooth implementation. “There were some country-specific issues relating to direct debit mandates and how they are handled,” says Hansen. “Danske Bank helped us a lot with their knowledge and their experience with other customers in similar situations.”</p>
<p>Looking forward, Hansen believes that the solution will continue to meet the company’s needs: “We are confident that Danske Bank will keep this product upgraded and developments in payment methods will be incorporated into the solution so that we can benefit from them.” In addition to the direct debit services currently in use, Hansen is currently investigating the option of using Collection Service to take over the company’s invoicing process.</p>

<h4 id="benefits-of-an-improved-invoice-to-cash-cycle-for-corporates">Benefits of an improved invoice-to-cash cycle for corporates</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Improved working capital.</p>

<li>
<p>Processing efficiency for both buyers and suppliers, leading to better productivity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cost reductions resulting from processing efficiency.</p>

<li>
<p>Possibility to reallocate staff from manual to value added tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simpler processes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="industry-innovation">Industry innovation</h3>
<p>Whereas the invoicing and payment processes have traditionally been separate, developments in the e-invoicing area mean that companies may now have the opportunity to combine these processes. This is an area that Danske Bank has particularly focused on. Claus Flanding, Senior Product Manager of Danske Bank, explains: “In many companies the invoicing and the collections process are separated. But is it really necessary to handle invoicing and collections in two processes? What if companies would be able to send only one invoice-file to the bank and then let the bank handle the e-invoices, the paper invoices and direct debits? This is easy to implement and very efficient for the company.”</p>
<p>In response to a customer request, Danske Bank developed its Collection Service solution, which merges the normally divided invoicing and collections processes into one streamlined operation. Collection Service deals with all file formats but customers receive notification of payments in a single chosen format, making automated matching much more feasible. The system also keeps track of which invoice and collection format(s) each debtor can receive.</p>
<p>Danske Bank’s solution illustrates how the drive for efficiency can be realised in the area of collections. Future developments in this area may see corporates developing collection factories to centralise their collections, much as payment factories have been used to manage payments more efficiently.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>In the current climate, corporates are more focused on cost savings and working capital improvements than ever before. The task of collecting payment from customers is of fundamental importance, yet processes are often inefficient, while variations between countries may make it difficult to adopt a centralised approach.</p>
<p>Although developments in the market can certainly help companies to improve their invoicing and collections processes, challenges remain and upcoming initiatives like the SEPA Direct Debit may take some time to become established. In the meantime, companies may have much to gain by adopting solutions that are capable of handling the various formats and infrastructures currently in the market.</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Well managed working capital and an efficiently run order-to-cash cycle reflects a company in good financial health. Historically, accounts receivable operations have lacked the automation and management tools necessary to exercise proper control and maintain timely cash flow, but there are software solutions available to resolve these problems. SunGard’s AvantGard Receivables, for example, focuses on improving credit and collection productivity by helping to optimise workflows and processes, leading to quantifiable results.</p>
<h3 id="the-order-to-cash-challenge">The order-to-cash challenge</h3>
<p>For many companies, order-to-cash processes are manually intensive and/or compounded by the vagaries of different local practices and systems. This makes it more difficult for credit and collections staff to perform their duties such as monitoring credit risk, chasing non-payments and resolving invoice disputes. It can also impede managers’ ability to oversee the process as they struggle with reports inconsistent in format and containing incomplete data. This makes it difficult to track compliance, monitor performance and forecast cash flow. These problems can lead to expensive funding decisions and high volumes of Days Sales Outstanding (DSO), potentially threatening the financial stability and reputation of a company.</p>
<p>The challenge for companies is how to run their order-to-cash operations so as to achieve greater control of their cash flows, maximise the use of those funds and increase visibility across the group.</p>
<div class="boxed">
<h4 id="what-makes-an-efficient-order-to-cash-cycle">What makes an efficient order-to-cash cycle?</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tight risk control, close monitoring of customer payment behaviour and routine evaluation of exposure in order to mitigate corporate credit risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automated processes and workflows to speed up cash flows and reduce DSO volumes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fully integrated systems and processes to improve productivity, reduce errors and decrease operating costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fewer past due account receivables so that cash is received more quickly in order to reduce borrowing requirements and interest expense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automated dispute resolution processes and work queues to manage and quantify deductions, disputes, chargebacks and claims more effectively, and therefore reduce bad debt expense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comprehensive reporting of activity across the company, promoting more accurate decision-making and improved compliance oversight.</p>
</li>

<p>Online portal access to provide up-to-date information and enhance customer service.</p>

<li>
<h5>Credit risk management.</h5>
<p>Comprehensive internal data, such as open and closed disputes, and external data, such as bank references, is aggregated by the system and used with a variety of management tools to review, assess and control corporate credit risk. These include custom credit scoring by account and multiple score cards, risk grades that can be used to determine the most appropriate collection strategy for each account and custom online credit applications for customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Strategic collections.</h5>
<p>Pre-defined collection strategies and strategy steps automatically execute as an invoice ages. For example, despatching reminders and past due notices to customers, notifying sales departments of delinquent accounts or placing telephone calls in a collector’s work queue. Companies can configure these strategies and the steps using categories such as risk grade, geographic location or balance due.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Dispute resolution.</h5>
<p>Disputes are automatically identified and assigned to specific ‘owners’, then routed to these owners’ work queues. The progress of every dispute is tracked and escalated to the appropriate level, with all relevant documentation attached.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Cash application.</h5>
<p>Remittance information can be accepted from multiple sources such as lockbox files, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) or bulk payment advice uploaded from customer files or websites. This information is automatically matched with exceptions placed in an exception queue. Deductions and adjustments are detected and assigned ownership based on customer, business unit or deduction reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>‘Rules’ driven engine.</h5>
<p>This enables specific criteria to be set in order to trigger an account’s routing to a particular work queue eg to a credit review, dispute resolution or remittance deduction work queue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>On-line customer service/electronic invoice presentment and payment.</h5>
<p>A web portal gives customers the ability to view their account details, download invoice copies, generate disputes and send payment information, including split invoices and partial payments. Referred to as a collaborative portal, real-time data can be seen by all parties including the customer, customer services, sales manager, credit analysts and collectors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Management dashboards and reporting.</h5>
<p>A centralised repository amalgamates data from multiple Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and account receivable systems, providing a single view and therefore greater visibility across an organisation, wherever subsidiaries are located. This includes performance monitoring, cash forecasting, root-cause analysis and corporate credit risk tracking.</p>
<p>The use of company-defined key performance indicators creates a comprehensive view for compliance oversight and allows management to certify processes, identify weaknesses and track the effectiveness of policies in accordance with their regulatory obligations.</p>

</div>
<h5 id="why-did-you-develop-avantgard-receivables">Why did you develop AvantGard Receivables?</h5>
<p>We wanted to develop a solution that would meet the changing demands of credit professionals. We consulted with a user group of our customers and discovered that their greatest need was to find a way to increase their turnover of account receivables and improve the efficiency of the various activities related to it. Working with them we developed AvantGard Receivables to provide a comprehensive and flexible trade management capability offering efficiencies and insight all the way along the order-to cash process. In 2005, we acquired The GETPAID Corporation, a provider of accounts receivables and collection software, which furthered our strategy to deliver a complete suite of solutions for improved liquidity management.</p>
<h5 id="why-do-companies-want-account-receivables-solutions">Why do companies want account receivables solutions?</h5>
<p>Essentially it’s the ability to do more with less – so lower costs, more operational efficiency, reduced DSO and improved turnover in A/R. Effectively managing A/R is important given that it is the single largest cash flow within an organisation. Improvement in this area means better liquidity management and proper use of the working capital cycle. It reduces reliance on other cash sources such as borrowing and the increased interest expense that brings. It also leads to a reduction in bad debt expense, effectively lowering what hits the bottom line.</p>
<h5 id="what-about-sarbanes-oxley-has-that-had-an-impact">What about Sarbanes-Oxley – has that had an impact?</h5>
<p>Yes. The need for regulatory compliance and the tools to help with that is certainly a factor now. Our customers tell us they can breeze through the related compliance requirements for A/R with our AvantGard Receivables solutions. It is easy to show that sufficient controls are in place and to provide the right reporting. This is definitely a key benefit.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-the-main-challenge-a-company-faces-within-the-order-to-cash-process">What is the main challenge a company faces within the order-to-cash process?</h5>
<p>I think the main challenge is that there can be a lot of manual processes and many interfaces with multiple systems, or even within one ERP system. Our AvantGard Receivables solutions eliminate this problem by combining everything into one single view. You can still have different treatments and regulatory requirements according to country, as well as flexibility around account and customer segments, but the number of people involved in the processing is significantly reduced.</p>

<p>The breadth, depth and integration of AvantGard’s offering through the entire cycle, from customer order to cash management. We can provide one collaborative vehicle. We also have proven results. Our customer base consists of large and well-known company names that have seen significant returns on their investment. It is one thing to sell an IT product, but it is another to show a customer their return on the investment they have made.</p>

<h5 id="what-are-sungards-development-plans-for-avantgard">What are SunGard’s development plans for AvantGard?</h5>
<p>We have a holistic approach to liquidity management and so we will continue to invest in treasury, accounts receivable and payment processing. Our aim is to offer a hub from which our customers can get all the information they need. Where we are not a direct provider, we can be a gateway in collaboration with third parties such as banks, credit agencies and scoring platforms, offering a better picture with greater global visibility. Essentially, we want to help our customers reap financial and operating benefits from improving their processes within the financial supply chain. We will continue to work with each of our customers to develop a combination of solutions that is right for them.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="customers">Customers</h5>
<p>SunGard’s AvantGard Receivables solutions serve a customer base of more than 350 companies, with over 20,000 users in 40 countries. The solutions are used by businesses across diverse industry sectors including chemical and pharmaceutical, consumer goods, industrial manufacturing, and media and entertainment. Many of these customers are large, multi-national corporations with global shared service centres.</p>
<h5 id="independent-study">Independent study</h5>
<p>In 2006, Forrester Consulting researched the potential return on investment that could be realised by deploying SunGard’s order-to-cash management solution for trade receivables. Forrester concluded that “the primary quantifiable benefit” to the company interviewed for the study “resulted from the improvement in credit-related financial measures such as DSOs and bad debt expense, increasing profitability for the company by over $2m in the first year.” This was in addition to other improvements, such as in the productivity of employees resolving credit and collections issues, employee satisfaction, and the ability to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley requirements.</p>
<h5 id="customer-feedback">Customer feedback</h5>
<p>Customer feedback suggests the same.</p>
<p>Pertti Metsälä, who is responsible for Shared Services IT/IS at Alfa Laval, says “AvantGard connected to our decentralised in-house ERP systems and helped us gain visibility and control into our receivables across Europe. As a result, we were able to reduce our past due accounts receivable by 42%.”</p>
<p>Bill Uhrich, Director of Corporate Credit for Dresser Inc., says “After we implemented AvantGard, we lowered our DSO, decreased past due A/R and reduced our bad debt reserve by 20%. With the increase in cash flow, Dresser increased working capital which not only helped the company to completely fund its ongoing operations, but contributed substantially to pay $115m in optional debt prepayments.”</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Corporate treasurers often face the liquidity management dilemma of having to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>obtain the best possible return on surplus cash</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>while limiting risks and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>maintaining access to the cash should it be required</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Bank deposits have long been the main choice for treasurers and ensure immediate access to cash. But, returns are often minimal. Time deposits on the other hand feature better returns, but the availability of cash may be restricted when funds are needed. That is why liquidity and enhanced liquidity funds have increasingly become a viable alternative to bank deposits as they have the ability to balance liquidity management objectives more efficiently.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-money-market-fund">What is a money market fund?</h3>
<p>A liquidity or money market fund is a mutual fund that invests only in high grade short-term money market instruments. These instruments include obligations of financial institutions as well as highly-rated short-term corporate debt such as commercial paper, notes and short-term bonds.</p>
<p>In order to be effective within the context of an investor’s cash management objectives, liquidity funds generally fulfil several criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Security.</h5>
<p>They are a secure and stable form of investment. Most money market funds have a AAA fund rating and the stable value is recognised in a suffix to the rating such as AAA-MR1+ or AAAm, which is applied to the top rated and most stable funds. Different credit rating agencies use different suffixes, but they are all a measure of the same thing – the volatility of the fund’s value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Liquidity.</h5>
<p>They provide liquidity as and when the treasurer needs the funds. Generally, investors are entitled to redeem their holdings daily, within the dealing cut-off times, at no charge or penalty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Yield.</h5>
<p>Liquidity funds offer the potential of increased yields relative to time deposits.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although all liquidity funds will aim to balance these three criteria, they may display different risk, yield and liquidity profiles.</p>
<p>In order to generate competitive returns while at the same time maintaining the fund’s capital and ensuring high levels of liquidity, liquidity funds are managed within specific investment guidelines. To achieve and maintain an AAA-rating, funds have to meet strict requirements in terms of asset quality, asset diversification and liquidity maintenance. In addition, they have to comply with rigorous standards concerning management, systems, controls and procedures.</p>
<p>The portfolio nature of the investments made by a fund has the advantage that it diversifies the risk in contrast to a bank deposit with a single bank. Investing in a liquidity fund is also relatively easy and eliminates the need to continuously track rates and monitor credit relationships.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-an-enhanced-liquidity-fund">What is an enhanced liquidity fund?</h3>
<p>In addition to the traditional money market funds, some fund managers will offer enhanced liquidity funds. These funds attempt to offer a higher yield than conventional liquidity funds.</p>
<p>This can be achieved by either taking on more credit risk – which will be reflected in the fund’s own credit rating – or by extending the fund’s duration through investing into longer maturities. The latter may influence the volatility of the fund’s performance and would be mirrored by a fund’s volatility rating and reflected in the suffix to the credit rating.</p>
<p>Enhanced liquidity funds come in many shapes and forms and under different names such as enhanced liquidity, enhanced cash, cash plus or liquidity plus funds. Generally, enhanced liquidity funds are much more heterogenic than money market funds. They vary in terms of maturity, duration, credit quality and liquidity profiles.</p>
<p>A corporate investor who wants to achieve better returns than a money market fund offers, should consider enhanced liquidity funds as the portfolio nature of funds makes them less risky than a single investment. It is however important to remember that a higher yield is typically linked to more risk, albeit this risk may still be relatively small even in an enhanced liquidity fund.</p>
<h3 id="the-use-of-liquidity-funds-in-cash-management">The use of liquidity funds in cash management</h3>
<p>A corporate investor seeking competitive returns for excess cash will find different investment alternatives depending on the time period for which excess cash balances are available for investment.</p>
<p>Short-term operational cash must be available instantly when required for working capital purposes. From a liquidity management perspective, capital preservation and liquidity are therefore the overriding objectives for this type of cash. Low-risk and highly liquid money market funds are, therefore, a suitable form of investment for any cash that is available for periods of less than three months.</p>

<p>Cash that can be invested for more than three months will not be used to its full potential when it is invested in a traditional liquidity fund that normally only has a maximum weighted average maturity of 60 days. Cash with a longer time horizon than three months may achieve a higher level of return and still meet the requirements of principal preservation and liquidity when invested in an enhanced liquidity fund.</p>
<p>These types of funds diversify outside the traditional money market instruments. They actively manage duration, typically between 90 and 365 days by using instruments such as commercial paper, floating-rate notes, asset-backed securities and short-term bonds.</p>
<p>When used in combination with liquidity funds, enhanced cash funds can offer a more efficient cash management solution, as the balance between risk, return and liquidity will be more in line with the investing company’s objectives.</p>
<h4 id="differences-between-funds">Differences between funds</h4>
<p>Although most liquidity funds may appear very similar, there are potentially significant differences between funds with regard to the size of the fund, liquidity, cut-off times, minimum amounts, share classes, performance and management fees. Depending on the portfolio, there can also be a marked difference in the credit quality of a fund, in particular between enhanced liquidity funds. In addition, customer service and ease of use are important criteria to distinguish between funds.</p>
<h3 id="rabo-liquidity-and-enhanced-liquidity-funds">Rabo Liquidity and enhanced liquidity funds</h3>
<p>Rabobank aims to meet the short-term cash management needs of investors through a range of AAA-rated money market funds. These include both liquidity and enhanced liquidity funds in EUR, USD and GBP, which have the objective of achieving competitive returns while preserving capital and maintaining a high degree of liquidity.</p>

</div>
<h5 id="how-do-rabo-funds-differ-from-other-liquidity-or-enhanced-cash-funds">How do Rabo funds differ from other liquidity or enhanced cash funds?</h5>
<p>The funds themselves are managed by ROBECO who is a 100% owned by Rabobank and the core competence centre for asset management within the Rabobank Group. ROBECO has a long history of investment management in Europe and a very strong track record in money market investment.</p>
<p>In addition, all our funds including the enhanced funds have an AAA rating. Many enhanced funds are AA rated, using the more relaxed investment guidelines from the ratings agencies to boost the yield. Being a AAA rated bank it seemed right to offer AAA rated enhanced funds.</p>
<p>When discussing the strategy with the fund managers for our enhanced fund, it was clear that there were other performance drivers which would boost yields while achieving a AAA fund rating. This has been proven with over a year’s worth of track record showing a performance of region of three months LIBOR plus 15bp after fees.</p>
<p>Management fees are low, 20-25bp for enhanced and 15-20bp for the standard funds depending on the size of investment.</p>
<p>Service is key, we strive to ensure clients are able to invest in their preferred method. We offer internet, fax, telephone and SWIFT dealing for subscriptions and redemptions. Surprisingly, many liquidity fund providers are still not able to offer internet dealing.</p>
<p>In addition, it is important that our clients have access to all the information they require. Therefore, clients are able to create customised reports via the internet, while knowing they have the full support of a dedicated client service team based in the Netherlands.</p>
<h5 id="which-type-of-investor-should-consider-enhanced-liquidity-funds">Which type of investor should consider enhanced liquidity funds?</h5>
<p>Enhanced funds should only be used by those clients who know they hold surplus cash balances for in excess of three months. The trend tends to be that clients try the SNAV<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> funds first and as they become more comfortable with money market funds and their investment manager, they may choose to place a proportion of their available cash into an enhanced fund. In addition, due to the vast array of enhanced style funds, it is important that as an investor you do as much research as possible, look at the different providers and make sure that you understand the nature of the product and the liquidity, the strategy and types of investments held in the portfolio.</p>
<p>Liquidity is important because, should you need your cash back quickly, with enhanced funds settlement can range from a T+1 to a T+7 type settlement.</p>
<p>However, bear in mind that if you do invest for only a month and a half you may not get the return that you would have got had you been in a SNAV fund or in another type of fund.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="rabo-liquidity-funds-2">Rabo Liquidity Funds</h4>
<p>Each investor in a liquidity fund is a shareholder in the fund’s diversified portfolio of money market securities.</p>
<p>Rabo Liquidity Funds have a Stable Net Asset Value (SNAV) of £1, €1 and $1. Shares are redeemed at par at maturity. Yields are declared daily and dividends paid monthly in arrears. If not specified otherwise in the application form, dividends will be converted into shares at the end of the month.</p>
<h4 id="rabo-enhanced-liquidity-funds-2">Rabo Enhanced Liquidity Funds</h4>
<p>Unlike stable net asset value liquidity funds, enhanced liquidity funds are variable or accumulating net asset value funds. This means that they do not distribute their income. Assets are marked to market daily and unrealised gains and losses are translated directly into the share price. The value of the accumulating shares increases proportionately as income is retained within the fund. Investors realise returns solely through the liquidation of their shares in the fund.</p>
<p>Rabo Enhanced Liquidity Funds have a maximum weighted average maturity of 180 days and are designed for cash balances in EUR, USD or GBP that are available for investment for at least three months. The funds are governed by the same investment policy as the liquidity funds, but in addition, aim to increase performance by investing in longer maturity asset-backed securities and offering a duration overlay which increases exposure to the money market yield curve.</p>
<h3 id="why-invest-in-rabo-liquidity-or-enhanced-liquidity-funds">Why invest in Rabo Liquidity or Enhanced Liquidity funds?</h3>
<p>Liquidity funds have to balance an investor’s cash management objectives and Rabo Liquidity and Enhanced liquidity funds offer competitive returns while maintaining the most stable credit and volatility ratings and ensuring maximum liquidity.</p>
<h4 id="liquidity">Liquidity</h4>
<p>The ability to redeem investments as quickly as possible when invested cash balances are required, gives investors the flexibility to react efficiently to the liquidity demands of their business. The funds’ late cut-off dealing times give investors the opportunity to establish available or required cash balances before subscribing or redeeming positions in the fund. Late cut-off dealing times and same-day settlement thereby ensure that the funds are both an investment and a cash management solution for investors.</p>
<p>Even in the Rabo enhanced liquidity funds, in which investors will have to have funds invested for longer than in the liquidity funds to achieve competitive returns, a high level of liquidity is maintained, which ensures that investors have access to their cash within one working day (T+1).</p>
<h4 id="security">Security</h4>
<p>Rabo liquidity and enhanced liquidity funds are AAA-rated by Standard and Poor’s (S&amp;P). This is the highest rating available for these types of funds. Furthermore, the enhanced liquidity funds have been assigned a volatility rating of S1+ by S&amp;P, indicating the lowest volatility. The AAA-rating may be particularly attractive to investors with strict exposure limits to counterparties of a specific credit rating.</p>
<p>The credit quality of the fund’s assets is undergoing continuous analysis within strict guidelines, limiting the concentration on individual issuers to a maximum of 5% and governing the credit rating of assets that can be held by the fund. As a result, the funds are diversified with regard to issuers and cover a range of high-grade debt instruments, in particular commercial paper and asset-backed securities. The enhanced liquidity fund will also use derivatives on a limited scale and investors need to ensure that they are comfortable with the fund’s use of derivatives.</p>
<h4 id="yield">Yield</h4>
<p>The objective of the funds is to generate competitive returns that are superior to other short-term investment instruments, such as time deposits. The funds are actively managed within the investment guidelines to achieve returns that exceed the benchmarks of 7-day LIBID for the liquidity funds and 3-month Libor for the enhanced liquidity funds.</p>
<h4 id="service">Service</h4>
<p>Subscriptions and redemptions can be placed using all major dealing methods, including phone and fax dealing, SWIFT and via the Rabo Liquidity Funds web-portal. Prices and yields are published on the next working day by email and can also be accessed over the internet or by calling the Rabobank client service team. The client service team also provides web-tool training as well as general assistance with any queries that might arise.</p>
<p>Rabobank offers two share classes, Elite and Premier, which, depending on the invested balance, incur different management fees of 15 or 20bp for the liquidity funds and 20 or 25bp for the enhanced funds. Premier shares require a minimum initial investment of 1m in €, $ or £, whereas Elite shares are allocated to larger amounts of 25 million euros or US dollars and 15 million GBP.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Rabo liquidity and enhanced liquidity funds combine competitive returns with the highest available credit ratings. The use of liquidity and enhanced liquidity funds, such as those offered by Rabobank, therefore represents not only a short-term investment alternative, but potentially a more efficient liquidity management solution for corporate treasurers.</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Multinational companies often have a wide range of different payment systems in place in order to cope with the assortment of different accounts, banks, networks and formats needed to process payments on a global scale. Increasingly, companies are looking for solutions that can consolidate their cash flows in order to improve visibility and facilitate a centralised approach to cash management. SunGard has recently expanded its capabilities in this area with the acquisition of Trax, the financial messaging and payment processing software provider.</p>
<h3 id="success-on-the-trax-leads-to-scale-problems">Success on the Trax leads to Scale problems</h3>
<p>In October 2006, SunGard announced the acquisition of Trax, the Belgium-based payment software solutions provider. Trax was founded in 2004 to provide an infrastructure for optimising payment flows, payment instructions and related information. “The product escaped from us when we started commercialising it,” comments Hans Cobben, Chief Operating Officer of AvantGard Payments and co-founder of Trax. “At a certain point in time we realised there was a real discrepancy between the size of our customers and implementations and the size of the company itself. So we started looking around at a number of options to grow the company. Since we already had a relatively mature product at that point of time – and we didn’t want any hiccups in the marketing of the product line – we were pleased when SunGard showed interest after our initial discussions.”</p>
<h3 id="solved-with-the-sungard-infrastructure">…solved with the SunGard infrastructure</h3>
<p>SunGard acquired Trax for two reasons. Firstly, Trax already had a strong presence in the market SunGard was aiming to develop. Secondly, both parties felt that Trax’s product complemented SunGard’s existing products in the payments area.</p>
<p>Following the acquisition, the Trax product was renamed AvantGard Trax and the company became SunGard’s AvantGard Payments focus area, part of the wider AvantGard suite offered by SunGard.</p>
<img alt="SunGard AvantGard" class="logo" height="60" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/sungard-avantgard-logo-2007-178x60.png" width="178"/>
<h3 id="what-it-does">What it does</h3>
<p>AvantGard Trax is a financial messaging platform that specialises in the initiation and reporting of payments. On the corporate side, it can be used to access multiple platforms, multiple networks and multiple protocols. It is also used by banks and is suitable for consolidating incoming payments from a range of sources, including corporate-to-bank and bank-to-bank transactions routed through a variety of clearing channels.</p>
<p>In addition, the AvantGard Trax reporting engine is used by corporates to consolidate cash positions across different accounts and currencies in real-time or for end of day reporting. Likewise, banks can access reporting information for their customers on a range of networks including SWIFTNet and the SunGard Transaction Network (SunGard STN).</p>
<p>AvantGard Trax also has applications used by banks wishing to optimise their exceptions handling processes or adopt SEPA compliant payment solutions.</p>
<h3 id="key-features">Key features</h3>
<aside class="definition">
<h5 id="swiftready-label">SWIFTReady label</h5>
<p>The SWIFTReady label is awarded annually by SWIFT to third-party applications meeting certain criteria. The award of the label indicates SWIFT compliance. There are two levels of label – Gold and Silver.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>AvantGard Trax Payment Factory provides a payments platform for corporates, enabling the cash flows of local subsidiaries to be centralised.</p>
</li>

<p>AvantGard Trax Corporate SWIFT Station is designed to act as an interface between SWIFTNet and corporates’ existing systems and is fully compatible with SWIFT messaging formats such as FIN and FileAct. A number of Trax applications have been awarded the SWIFTReady label. SunGard has always had a strong relationship with SWIFT, collaborating to develop solutions which allow clients to connect to SWIFT. In addition, SunGard is a member of SWIFT and also supplies SWIFT itself with certain software solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AvantGard Trax is a rule-based system, meaning that rules can easily be added to govern the behaviour of its payment instructions and reporting methods. For example, the system can be set up to route payment instructions through different banks or clearing systems depending on the company’s cash position on specified accounts.</p>

<h5 id="what-differentiates-avantgard-trax-from-your-competitors-products">What differentiates AvantGard Trax from your competitors’ products?</h5>
<p>One differentiator is time to market. AvantGard Trax is ready, it’s there, it works. The rollout of the AvantGard Trax platform is relatively short – generally speaking, for corporates we’re talking an implementation time of one to three months; for banks, three to six months.</p>
<p>It is also very adaptable, and adapts to the existing environments in which it is being installed. AvantGard Trax sits in between existing platforms and payment initiation systems. These could be SAP, accounts payable systems, salary systems, local infrastructures – typically our corporate clients are using a wide range of systems as a result of mergers and acquisitions over the last couple of years. AvantGard Trax adapts itself to all these formats, protocols and networks, and gives you a very easy way of integrating all these flows to a bank.</p>
<p>From a banking point of view, if you install AvantGard Trax for a SEPA-compliant payment processing infrastructure, again AvantGard Trax will adapt itself to the existing back office infrastructure. As such, it allows a gradual adaptive evolutionary approach to these new standards and market requirements, rather than trying to do ‘big bang’ implementations – which as you know often result in a lot of big bangs and not necessarily a solution!</p>
<p>One last differentiator I would underline is that AvantGard Trax is a rule-based system which very easily caters for additional functionality. It is an evolutionary system in itself – if you want to add functionality to an existing system later on, it is very open to that.</p>
<h5 id="why-should-treasurers-be-interested-in-this-sort-of-solution-now">Why should treasurers be interested in this sort of solution now?</h5>
<p>Treasurers are facing a number of challenges. First of all, cash management and cash forecasting continue to be laborious tasks of gathering, integrating and tying together reports, phone calls, post-it notes and so on. This is because you’ve got a multitude of systems that move cash up and down in the organisation. The treasury system should be able to have a clear view of these information flows. AvantGard Trax sits between the cash management system and the treasury management system and all these flows and it can initiate high value payments from the treasury system in order to do sweeping or pooling. At the same time, it can report back into the treasury system virtually in real-time what cash movements are happening in different positions, with different account systems and with different banks – it ties all these things together.</p>
<p>That’s also where the strength is in combination with our treasury solution, AvantGard Quantum. AvantGard Quantum is fed virtually real-time operation information out of AvantGard Trax, which comes directly from the bank via SWIFTNet. On the other side, AvantGard Quantum can initiate high value treasury payments to any bank directly through AvantGard Trax. So AvantGard Quantum has the payment initiation and reporting components, but these are used for treasury purposes alone. AvantGard Trax can unify those functionalities with all the other flows that are being initiated and reported on – such as accounts receivable, low value payments, direct debits and salary payments.</p>
<h5 id="do-customers-buy-avantgard-trax-as-a-stand-alone-product">Do customers buy AvantGard Trax as a stand-alone product or with the rest of the AvantGard suite?</h5>
<p>Both. There are customers that have treasury needs and no payments automation needs and they will go solely with an AvantGard Treasury solution. You also have customers that have both of these needs, and they will have an AvantGard solution with Treasury and Payments capabilities. Even before Trax became AvantGard Payments, we had a number of customers that were already AvantGard Treasury users and needed to add payments capabilities – and we’re now providing AvantGard Treasury solutions to a number of existing AvantGard Payments customers, which clearly underlines the need for an integrated approach. We also provide AvantGard Payments capabilities to a number of other Treasury Solutions.</p>
<p>Where AvantGard Trax adds value is in its ability to unify the treasury management system with companies’ other cash management and cash operations initiating systems – like salary payments, ERP systems and others. AvantGard Trax very much allows for the transparent and SOX-compliant execution of these payments operations. In terms of its relationship with AvantGard Quantum, typically it broadens the horizon of AvantGard Quantum for the payments part of the AvantGard Quantum activities and functionalities. Then of course you’ve got AvantGard receivables, which makes the package complete and ensures a centralised view of what is happening from within these AvantGard applications.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="customers">Customers</h3>
<p>The majority of AvantGard Payments’ corporate customers are multinational companies looking to obtain visibility over their local cash flows. A classic example is Yves Rocher, which is using AvantGard Trax to maintain a centralised view over its cash flows in 13 different countries and across a range of different banks and currencies.</p>
<p>On the banking side, SEPA is an important factor which is having a significant impact on AvantGard Trax’s business. “Those banks that really want to play a determining role in the SEPA area are coming to AvantGard Trax to have SEPA-compliant solutions while still using non-SEPA-compliant payment instructions,” says Cobben. “One of the big challenges for these banks is becoming compliant with the SEPA ruling while respecting the existing standards and payment infrastructures. This is quite a challenge – not just from a formatting point of view, but also from an information and compliance point of view.”</p>
<h3 id="future-developments">Future developments</h3>
<p>Looking ahead, AvantGard is focused on working to ensure SEPA compliance in Europe. While its products are as ready as possible in terms of compliance with the standards that have been published so far, further updates will be required as the new rulebooks and formats are published.</p>
<p>In addition, AvantGard is working on developing its offerings further to ensure that it can handle payment transactions from beginning to end. In particular, it is currently developing solutions for low value payment initiation to expand its existing capabilities. It is also working on being able to provide ASP and hosted solutions for payment initiation and execution.</p>
<p>Finally, AvantGard is focusing on solutions that combine centralised cash management with distributed liquidity management capabilities. Cobben reports that centralised treasuries are increasingly asking their local subsidiaries to provide a certain level of liquidity forecasting and management, while still wishing to retain a centralised view of these activities. AvantGard is working on solutions that make this possible.</p>
<p>SunGard’s incorporation of Trax into its AvantGard suite comes at a time when suppliers in this space are increasingly aiming to provide clients with holistic solutions to cover all their payment needs. The close fit between Trax’s solution and SunGard’s global capabilities with existing products makes this a particularly interesting acquisition.</p>

<p>Treasurers at large multinational companies have to use a multitude of tools to monitor their cash, to control their working capital, to maximise inter-company netting and to keep a close eye on subsidiary cash forecasting.</p>
<figure class="photo left"><img alt="w1se KBC Bank" height="145" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/2005/10//2005-10-tt-05-pp-w1se-kbc-logo-130x145.png" width="130"/></figure>
<p>In principle, a treasurer can receive data feeds providing intra-day information on all the accounts and transactions of the Group. It is also technically possible for the same treasurer to initiate payments and collections from bank accounts all around the world, but this implies a multitude of e-banking solutions. Another solution is to streamline payments and receivables processes by centralising them in a shared service centre or a payments factory using single bank accounts in each country.</p>
<p>However, in a world where tax, legal and financial infrastructures remain stubbornly different, a consistent ‘one country, one bank and one bank account’ setup is never achievable in practice. Despite the introduction of a common currency in the EU, the advent of truly efficient pan-European payment systems still lies several years ahead. Europe remains a fragmented environment for transaction initiation and processing. Each country still has its own domestic payments and collections systems. These systems all use different messaging protocols and format standards.</p>
<p>So how can a company make cost effective payments (especially bulk payments) and collections across all these systems? And how can it effectively manage cash?</p>
<p>The w1se Corporate e-Banking application and MA-CUG services of KBC offer solutions to these problems.</p>
<h4 id="a-w1se-solution">A ‘w1se’ solution</h4>
<p>w1se Corporate e-Banking offered by the KBC Group is a multi-currency, multi-country, multi-language, multi-user gateway, running on a common server and accessible through the internet from any location in the world.</p>
<p>There is no need for on-site implementation, a characteristic of most traditional electronic banking solutions, and staff worldwide all use the same application and databases. The system is very flexible and can be tailored to meet the company’s individual requirements and to match its organisational structure – particularly those with multiple operating units in several countries.</p>
<p>w1se provides direct access to manage and monitor local bank accounts, supporting the full range of local payment and collection systems in all countries covered by the KBC Group and providing remote access to accounts held at over 200 other banks worldwide. Using w1se corporate e-Banking, a treasurer can centralise liquidity positions and yet still initiate payments and collections by using less expensive local payment systems for their bulk transactions.</p>
<p>KBC Group’s strong position in Central Europe strengthens the strategic importance of the w1se Corporate e-Banking solution. KBC Group owns major banks in Hungary, the Czech and Slovak Republics and in Poland. Any company can benefit from w1se, but the application has been designed specifically for corporate customers who are looking for a single solution covering all their electronic banking needs in many countries.</p>
<h3 id="the-w1se-concept">The w1se concept</h3>
<p>KBC Group invested over several years to develop the w1se Corporate e-Banking, aiming to create as much value as possible for its customers by taking maximum advantage of web based technology. The concept is simple – replace a host of domestic e-banking applications in several countries with a single system.</p>
<h4 id="w1se-facilitates-multi-country-transaction-flows">w1se facilitates multi-country transaction flows</h4>
<p>Companies that expanded internationally before ERP systems allowed them to integrate payables and receivables across regions, often face big problems. Their different ERP systems may generate several different payment formats depending on the countries where they are active. w1se offers them several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>w1se supports all the most common national payment formats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>w1se also supports the most common national electronic collection formats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>w1se enables efficient input of individual payments and collections – a built-in guidance logic defines the payment type and displays the appropriate payment or collection screen for completion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>w1se helps the user to initiate country-specific low value and high value payments, salary payments, global debit instructions, recurrent payments and (non) pre-authorised collections.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Companies with ERP systems that allow the generation of Swift MT101 files (Request for Transfer) can import mixed files containing both domestic and cross-border payments in different currencies and even different countries. The w1se infrastructure ensures a seamless interface from the various KBC Bank entities and partner banks all the way to the end user.</p>

<h4 id="super-user-concept">Super User concept</h4>
<p>‘Super Users’ are appointed within the company by the company’s management. They are entitled to create and delete users who may access the company’s w1se contract and administrative set-up.</p>
<p>The advantages of this concept are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Super Users define the roles, entitlements and authorisations of users having access to the w1se application around the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The impact of any staff turnover is reduced, as Super Users can create new users on an as-needed basis and grant them specific authorisations within the w1se application.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, w1se enables companies to create an e-Banking access framework that fully corresponds to their organisational structure. Geographically separated departments, branches and/or subsidiaries can individually access the same application and databases.</p>
<h4 id="state-of-the-art-security">‘State-of-the-art’ security</h4>
<figure class="photo right"><img alt="Photo of an Isabel Secure Signing smart card" height="173" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/2005/10/2005-10-tt-05-pp-isabel-secure-signing-smart-card-300x173.jpg" width="300"/></figure>
<p>Security is a key issue in e-Banking. Therefore, Isabel has been selected as the security provider for w1se.</p>
<p>Isabel secures e-Banking and e-Commerce applications for more than 30,000 companies in Europe. Its security application, based on Public Key Infrastructure, has an excellent proven track record.</p>
<p>Isabel’s security platform uses a smart card (containing the user’s secret key). w1se Corporate e-Banking verifies the user’s certificate and his/her entitlements any time he/she tries to access the application or sign any payment or collection instruction.</p>
<h4 id="powerful-information-reporting-tools">Powerful information reporting tools</h4>
<p>Proper financial management is based on timely, accurate and comprehensive information. Users can retrieve account information or bank statements for consultation on-line, for the generation of pre-formatted reports or for export to other database applications in multiple formats.</p>
<p>w1se supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Intra-day reporting, either generated automatically, upon request or at pre-defined times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>End-of-day reporting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bank statements which can be made available to various employees at different locations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Account information which can be downloaded in country-specific formats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flexible generation of standardised reports.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For corporates with advanced account reporting needs, KBC offers an add-on tool installed on a local PC. This offers a wide range of extra reporting and data manipulation functionalities based on the account statements exported via w1se, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Value dated balances and history.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Management of in-house (internal) current accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extensive search possibilities in the transactional database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Easy integration into General Ledger and Cash and Treasury management applications.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="w1se-user-support">w1se user support</h4>
<p>w1se is a multi-lingual application that allows the user to switch easily between languages (Czech, Dutch, English, French, German, Hungarian, Polish and Slovak). The w1se helpdesks, located in KBC entities in Western and Central Europe, provide support to the w1se users in their own language. The embedded shadowing function facilitates a high quality support by focusing on the customers’ specific issue.</p>

</div>
<p>FedEx Corporation Treasury department was looking for a secure web based banking platform that would:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Provide easy access to its local entities to electronic banking for payments initiation and information reporting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support its move towards a centralised payment factory.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Dominique Stevens, Treasury Manager for Europe, Middle East and Africa wanted to ensure that while FedEx operations continue to expand in Central and Eastern Europe, good controls and visibility was being kept centrally over payment and collection flows.</p>
<p>Ms Stevens comments: “w1se Corporate e-Banking successfully replaced local electronic banking systems for both Belgium and the Netherlands, but additionally it provided us with a single banking platform to handle cash management for our Czech and Polish operations. There are several parties involved in different phases of the working capital cycle that all required access to either the payments module, or to relevant bank information related to cash flows. Amongst these parties we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Finance Service Centre (FSC), located in Brussels, which acts as a payment factory for FedEx in Europe. The FSC handles primarily vendor payments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sub regional accounting centre, based in Frankfurt for Central Europe, which handles critical tax and salary payments. Credit allocation and reconciliation of customer receipts is also handled at that level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Treasury department, also located in Brussels, which manages the treasury flows for all entities in Europe, Middle East and Africa.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to the web-enabled banking solution, payments are initiated and collection files are imported from multiple locations/countries, and made available to all respective authorised users on the platform regardless of their location. The verification and approval process of such transactions follows the same logic, and is done in accordance with the powers of attorney, which are maintained on-line in w1se.</p>
<p>Through one single w1se contract, FedEx manages the financial flows of eight different legal entities with accounts in several countries. The multilingual application covers 24 users sharing one global e-banking solution.”</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>One single database, accessible for all entitled users, at any location.</p>

</ul>
<p>Some very large companies with high payment volumes may prefer to access their banks via SWIFT and use KBC’s MA-CUG gateway.</p>
<h3 id="kbc-ma-cug-a-flexible-added-value-swift-gateway-approach-for-corporates">KBC MA-CUG: A flexible, added-value SWIFT gateway approach for corporates</h3>
<p>Large multinational companies have been looking at ways to communicate with all their banking partners via one platform and one connection. SWIFT decided to grant corporate customers access to their secure network via MA-CUGs ( = Member Administered Closed User Groups), guaranteeing a communication gateway with a high level of reliability, availability and security.</p>
<p>KBC Bank, one of the major Belgian banks, strengthened its image as an innovative partner in e-business by launching the first corporate in the Benelux onto the SWIFT network via a MA-CUG in December 2002. Since then, a growing number of ‘corporate’ customers have joined this new ‘gateway’ to communicate with their banking partners.</p>
<p>KBC has gradually enlarged its MA-CUG service offering by adding new functionalities on top of the basic offering of sending ‘request for transfer’ payments instructions via FIN MT101 or receiving Customer Statements via FIN MT940 over SWIFTNet.</p>
<p>By offering access to SWIFTNet FileAct, KBC enables corporate customers to exchange structured payment files and account reporting with the Bank in a secure and reliable way. SWIFTNet FileAct is particularly suited for bulk payments and bulk account reporting.</p>
<p>An important drawback of the MA-CUG concept is that a corporate must join the MA-CUG of each banking partner they are working with. KBC has bilateral agreements in place with over 220 (mostly corporate) banks worldwide and decided to offer that reach to its MA-CUG customers by creating a conduit function, covering both payments and reporting.</p>
<p>The KBC SWIFT Distributor functionality enables the corporate customer to forward his payment instructions through his KBC MA-CUG gateway, irrespective of where the corporate customer’s account is held.</p>
<p>Similarly, the KBC SWIFT Collector functionality allows a corporate treasury to centralise receipt of all his end-of-day or intra-day account statements via a single MA-CUG connection with KBC Bank. This implies that the account holding subsidiary instructs its bank to forward these statements to KBC Bank.</p>
<p>With the conduit service, the KBC MA-CUG solution fully responds to the requirements of multinational companies who want to centralise their transfer flows and treasury management in an integrated way and who look for a single, uniform gateway solution to communicate and exchange files with their banking partners worldwide.</p>
