<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>

<p>At Newell Brands, the US manufacturer and distributor of household brands spanning home appliances to office supplies, liquidity calls come in clear cycles. The company requires most liquidity in the beginning of the year when it is building up its inventory but come the end of the second quarter, that inventory starts to ship, shortly followed by invoicing, and realising cash.</p>
<p>It’s an approach that balances cash-on-hand with the rate of received cash, inventory – but not too much lest it tie up too much liquidity – and timely and nimble access to the capital markets, explains Robert Westreich, Senior VP Treasurer and Chief Tax Officer at Newell Brands, speaking to Treasury Today from the company’s Atlanta office, just back from a whistlestop tour to Newell’s Dublin office. “Liquidity is the lifeblood of the organisation. You must have immediate, short and long-term plans to manage it.”</p>
<p>Westreich shapes a proactive strategy around tiers. The company runs a global notional cash pool that effectively deploys cash and minimises the amount of cash on hand; a receivables factoring programme provides cash more quickly than standard traditional collection activity, and the cash conversion cycle effectively manages days payable outstanding and days inventory outstanding.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, liquidity is ensured via a low-cost commercial paper facility providing immediate funding if needed, and a longer-term debt programme managed across maturities and not stacked up in one particular year. Under the cash conversion cycle, Westreich targets a long-term 50-day conversion rate, currently around 70 days but reduced from a high of 120 days. “The lower the cash conversion cycle, the more cash you produce and the greater your liquidity,” he says. He also targets a 100% ratio of free cash flow to net income. “If you can convert all your net income to cash, you’re doing a great job,” he says.</p>
<p>In Asia, liquidity at Japanese car giant Nissan is also front of mind for Rakesh Kochhar, Senior Vice President Global Treasury and Sales Finance, in the car company’s Tokyo head office. The working capital requirements of the company rose during the pandemic on a combination of lower sales and higher inventory. Now the ongoing semiconductor shortage, coupled with longer shipping times as global ports remain clogged, has compounded the need to have high inventory levels, lest manufacturing plants are left short of vital components when semiconductors are in stock. “Our working capital requirements have increased, and we have secured high levels of liquidity to fund it,” says Kochhar.</p>
<h4 id="rising-rates">Rising rates</h4>
<p>Anecdotes from global treasurers reflect the challenges of liquidity management in the current environment. From supply chain issues leading corporates to maintain high inventory levels to demand unknowns coming out of the pandemic, liquidity is front of mind. But perhaps the most pressing and critical component of liquidity and working capital management is the impact of rising interest rates on the cost of servicing and refinancing debt added to corporate balance sheets when money was free. “A recession impacts all businesses differently, some that are long in the short part of the curve with size will be caught in an uncomfortable situation without the notional or yields needed to offset these higher borrowing costs. I’d expect their net interest expense to move unfavourably which is fairly easy to spot by investors,” predicts Todd Yodder who heads up global corporate treasury at Fluor Corporation, the Texas-based engineering and construction firm.</p>
<p>Companies with negative cash flows using debt to invest in the business will particularly struggle. But stable companies financing debt at maturity will also feel the pinch. “In the last couple of weeks, a company that was paying 1% on US$5bn is now paying 3% which accounts to some US$150m of additional interest. It’s not insignificant,” says Kochhar. “Companies are sitting pretty that raised money two to three years ago but when it comes to refinancing it will be much more expensive.”</p>
<p>Newell Brands locked in low rates back in 2016 when it issued around US$12bn debt of which around US$1bn notes are due in 2023. Mindful that only the current swathe of rate rises are priced in, Westreich is keenly watching central bank nuance and signs to time refinancing. The company has a split rating with the credit agencies meaning its bonds are a combination of investment grade and high-yield – where the cost of borrowing has risen sharply. As the price of these bonds moves in the opposite direction to their yield it is triggering a different strategy. “Yields are moving dramatically so for our longer-dated bonds the cost of buying them back is actually cheaper because the yields have risen so much.”</p>
<p>ESG-linked issuance also offers a route to cheaper borrowing. Nissan raised US$11bn in 2020 in three, five, seven and ten-year tranches and Kochhar doesn’t expect to have to return to the market to meet new funding needs, hopeful that supply bottlenecks and inflation will ease. “Our hope is that the supply chain improves, and we will have lower working capital and liquidity needs. I don’t anticipate our working capital and funding needs going up,” he says. However, he is contemplating ESG issuance pegged to the company’s ongoing transition to electric vehicles enabling a tap of more favourably priced debt should interest rates grind higher. “You can raise money at attractive rates if it is linked to ESG and we may do something in the next couple of years. Not because we need the money, but because we want to tap this market and it is good brand equity – it conveys the fact we are a responsible company.”</p>
<p>Nissan also has another strategy in place to counter the impact of rising interest rates on vehicle demand. A so-called captive finance offering, where the company acts like a bank and lends to its customers to finance car purchases, is helping it manage profitability in a rising interest rate environment. Nissan borrows from its banks or the capital markets and lends to customers on a fixed rate. Although there is typically a few months lag between interest rates going up and Nissan charging more to customers, the business offers an important hedge. Even when interest rates were declining it proved profitable since the cost of borrowing for customers reduced with a time lag after Nissan’s own costs came down. “It’s a very attractive part of the business,” explains Kochhar. “Our captive finance business contributes a significant proportion of our total profits.”</p>
<h4 id="borrowing-ahead">Borrowing ahead</h4>
<p>Some treasurers Treasury Today spoke to regret not having locked in across the curve during the rock bottom borrowing costs of the pandemic and now fear the kind of interest rates not experienced for a decade. Others are adamant the cure cannot be worse than the disease; rates will have to settle down following aggressive hikes by central banks. Indeed, it feels like treasury has fallen into two distinct camps: those that have been anticipating and waiting for rates to go up for years, and those that might have left it too late. “One group, anticipating for years, is finally looking right however we know that being right and early is many times as costly as being wrong,” reflects Yoder. “The other group is looking to get long fixed but may be caught late without adequate market appetite. Time always tells who was right. I have always been a believer in balancing rate, duration, and repricing risk on both sides to minimise impacts to net interest income.”</p>
<p>Moreover, corporate liquidity needs will be different for different companies in different regions. Some sectors like transport, particularly shipping, are generating huge stockpiles of liquidity, says Frankfurt-based Marion Reuter, Standard Chartered’s Regional Head of Transaction Banking Sales UK/Europe. Elsewhere, companies with large exposure to China, still in the grip of lockdown, are burning through their liquidity to keep operations running but generating few sales or revenue. “Companies with large exposures to China are most worried about their liquidity. Few companies operating in China are making any revenue because everyone is sitting at home. It’s having a massive impact on liquidity.”</p>
<h4 id="new-trends">New trends</h4>
<p>Reuter also notices important new strategies emerging. Before, corporates tended to put cash into structured products with fixed tenors, hunting for the best possible yield. Now, more are putting money into their current accounts in a deliberately short-term approach, not committing on tenor but expecting maximum yield and banks to pass on the benefits of higher interest rates on deposits. It’s a challenge for banks, she says. “We are seeing lots of competitive bidding for money to sit in current accounts. From a cash management perspective, we are not traders, and this is not the way we are used to working with clients. What clients are leaving on account is very much linked to yield.”</p>
<p>It is feeding into another trend: a swathe of RFPs. Corporates are actively consolidating and paring back on their global and local bank relationships in an approach designed to both shore up liquidity and leverage the most favourable deposit rates. “If a company has liquidity in 20 different bank pockets it’s not efficient or visible,” says Reuter. “Corporates are reviewing their bank partnerships to better manage their cash and liquidity.”</p>
<p>RFP and tender activity are proving an opportunity for Standard Chartered to win new relationships in its core regions Asia, Africa, and the Middle East that don’t typically benefit from a high churn of mandate activity. “Our key markets are not typically tendered first because the different currencies mean they are not easily centralised but now we see many tenders across our markets. We are pleased with this development so there is still a lot to win and gain in our markets.”</p>
<h4 id="value-creation">Value creation</h4>
<p>Liquidity considerations have also made value creation more important. Share buy backs to take advantage of cheap equities; deleveraging and dividend increases are all on the cards as corporates seek to return value to shareholders and shore up share prices in the volatile equity markets.</p>
<p>Newell has put in place strategies to cut debt since that 2016 issuance, reducing the cost of funding by deleveraging by over 50%. Elsewhere the company has shored up the share price via buybacks, throwing off the proceeds from a recent divestment. The company has a payout ratio of above 50% on its dividend and a dividend yield of 5%. Buoyed by less debt and a healthy share price, when it comes to refinancing, his priority is to remain nimble. Rather than lock in long-term borrowing with no opportunity to call the bond he is considering short-term, variable adjusted rates and exploring cross currency swaps. “There are tools in the box treasury teams can put in place,” he says.</p>
<p>Yoder also sees potential for some companies to grow their share price. “If we continue to see risk-off, those companies able to deploy excess capital with favourable return on capital employed (ROCE) and free cash flow (FCF) will have an advantage maintaining, and growing, their share price,” he says. “It is the challenge of every treasury to establish and maintain a ROC [return of capital] plan that investors’ want to see if you are not going to de-lever or invest in the business, you are going to need the optimal mix of repurchase and dividends.”</p>
<p>Nissan has just restarted paying dividends and Kochhar says it is up to the Nissan Board to consider buybacks at the appropriate time. Still, he notes many companies are looking at buying back their stocks in the current environment. “This is a good time to start buybacks because stocks are so attractively priced,” he says, pointing to most buyback activity amongst Chinese corporates.</p>
<p>From supply chain priorities and getting inventory levels right, the need for cash on-hand given enduring pandemic unknowns, especially in China, all the while navigating the prospect of higher borrowing and business costs leaves liquidity as much a priority as ever. Treasury’s cash operation is an unsung hero. Few people know about it – or want to know about it – but if it breaks down, its impact is profound.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p id="audio"><strong>Listen to the audio teaser below:</strong></p>
<iframe frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless="" src="https://player.captivate.fm/episode/0c3cf4b6-8856-4b31-bc6d-2d1fc8ff0953" style="width: 100%; height: 170px;"></iframe>
<p>With the COVID-19 pandemic showing no signs of abating, and newer virus variants challenging the efficacy of vaccines, there are more questions than answers as to what comes next. The cautious optimism of early 2021 about a potential V-shaped economic recovery is turning into despondency as the delta strain forces more countries into varying degrees of lockdowns.</p>
<p>For corporates, the lingering uncertainty not only prolongs the need to do more with stretched resources as staff continue to work from home, but also undermines treasurers’ cash flow forecasts predicated on assumptions of a post-pandemic recovery. Moreover, the pandemic has affected industries in different ways and forced companies to continue to maintain large liquidity reserves, albeit for various reasons, which also poses new challenges for banks supporting them.</p>
<h4 id="liquidity-too-little-or-too-much">Liquidity: too little or too much</h4>
<p>In Asia Pacific, sectors such as aviation, retail and hospitality continue to endure the worst of the crisis and struggle to stay afloat as travel remains largely restricted. On the other hand, corporates in technology, logistics and luxury sectors are flush with record cash flows thanks to the e-commerce boom. Though the dividend payouts this year have been robust, the excess liquidity presents these corporates and banks with a conundrum: How to deploy this mountain of cash?</p>
<p>“Ordinarily, surplus cash would have been channelled into organic or inorganic expansions through capex or M&amp;A; activity, with some liquidity being parked with banks and in yield-bearing deposits. However, corporates are putting many of these large and long-term investment decisions on hold because of the uncertain outlook for the pandemic and growing geopolitical tensions,” says Krishna Sampath, Head of Corporate Deposits Line, Asia Pacific.</p>
<p>For example, increasingly volatile relations between the world’s two largest economies—China and the US - has forced several technology, media, and telecoms (TMT) companies across Asia, especially in China, to list IPOs in China and Hong Kong instead of the US. These corporates are also employing a wait and watch approach before deploying the raised capital in large investments, which has also led to an increase in short-term bank deposits.</p>
<p>However, this presents a new challenge for treasurers as they discover that depositing large volumes of cash with banks isn’t as easy as it used to be and can come at a cost, especially for negative yielding currencies such as the Euro, Yen and Swiss franc. This adversely impacts treasurers’ P&amp;L; statements.</p>
<p>Banks, which in the pre-pandemic days comfortably accepted and offered competitive returns on deposits, are starting to impose limits on deposit volumes for large corporates and charge interest on negative-yielding currencies. It has become harder for banks to deploy such large liquidity volumes for onward lending as the pandemic leads to a deterioration in counterparty credit ratings of borrowers. In the absence of a corresponding increase in assets, the balance sheet cost of excess liquidity is increasing for banks, forcing them to re-price corporate clients’ deposits.</p>
<h4 id="creating-win-win-solutions">Creating win-win solutions</h4>
<p>“Corporates have started seeking alternative ways to overcome challenges arising from either too much or not enough liquidity, and we are actively engaging treasurers to find mutually beneficial solutions to resolve the liquidity conundrum,” Krishna adds.</p>
<p>Cash-surplus corporates are turning to money market funds as an alternative to park liquidity. Such off-balance sheet solutions by way of third-party investment options are a win-win for corporates as well as banks. Corporates potentially earn a better yield than what banks can offer in the current environment, and at the same time banks save on costs associated with holding on to excess liquidity and create more headroom to nurture long-term strategic relationships.</p>
<p>Those needing to shore up liquidity are finding banks willing to finance corporates that have established clear Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) goals through ESG-linked offerings. The pandemic has provided a major impetus for companies to embrace ESG goals to fulfil expectations of customers, investors, and other stakeholders of a targeted approach to sustainability. ESG and sustainability are now a key corporate treasury priority.</p>
<p>Corporates are also discovering that sustainability-linked loans offer the most straightforward route for them to dip their toes into ESG debt financing. Banks, too, are keen to provide such financing to corporates with clear sustainability goals to build a pool of green and sustainable assets on their books—a win-win for borrowers and lenders.</p>
<h4 id="enabling-treasurers-to-do-more-with-less">Enabling treasurers to do more with less</h4>
<p>Working from home is still the default for many corporates in Asia Pacific, hence their limited treasury resources remain stretched. Amid the pandemic, the treasurer’s role has evolved into that of a strategic partner to the business. Treasury departments have increasingly embraced automation to reduce the need to engage in mundane tasks and have started to focus their scarce resources on gathering and analysing data to add value to the business.</p>
<p>In this challenging environment, treasurers have started to demand that banks provide them with real-time visibility and control over their companies’ cash positions. With this information on hand, they can make timely decisions to manage their working capital, for example, make deposit placements, fund intercompany loans and make FX conversions. Furthermore, they are also looking to their banking partners to enable these transactions via digital, paperless and automated solutions that will help them transform their operational processes, and alleviate the workload of the increasingly strategic treasury team. BNP Paribas has used this feedback to expand the self-service options for its liquidity management clients through its Connexis Cash online platform.</p>
<p>The liquidity module in Connexis Cash offers a fully automated solution for managing cash pool balances and intercompany loans, including a variety of self-administration options. This allows treasurers to view and manage intercompany lending and borrowing balances and interest between parent entity and affiliates in real time, as well as extract detailed intercompany interest statements for current or past interest periods.</p>
<p>Furthermore, through Connexis Cash, corporate treasurers can also invest excess cash online in short tenor term deposits in a range of currencies to maximise interest yields in today’s low-rate environment. Instead of having to pick up the phone to call their relationship bank, treasurers can simply go online and place deposits in a more efficient and seamless fashion. “Both of these solutions effectively eliminates the exchange of paper documentation between our clients and us, a key target outcome of these solutions, and allows corporate treasury teams to make most of the resources at hand,” Krishna explains.</p>
<p>More than 18 months into the pandemic, even as the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel remains elusive and the tunnel appears to get longer, corporates continue to invest in digitalising treasury management and embrace real-time solutions for managing liquidity and payments. BNP Paribas will continue to be a key partner for our clients in this journey and is committed to deepen our engagement to help treasurers overcome existing and new pain points.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>

<p>Earlier this year, State Street Global Advisors published the results of an international survey of senior executives with cash management responsibilities. Most of the report’s findings were fairly predictable, such as the fact that the majority of corporates had increased their overall allocations to cash. However, the authors also suggested that corporates would adopt a more active approach to liquidity management in 2021.</p>
<p>Francois Masquelier, former Senior Vice President &amp; Head of Treasury and Enterprise Risk Management at RTL Group and CEO of Simply Treasury, agrees that the value destruction caused by persistent low or even negative interest rates requires consideration of options with longer tenors and potentially higher return expectations, but also the prospect of increased volatility.</p>
<p>“However, treasurers need to strike a balance between products with and without qualification as ‘cash and cash equivalent’ to make sure they offset the gross debt on a consolidated basis,” he explains. “They also need to understand the characteristics and inherent risks of emerging products.”</p>
<p>Masquelier warns that this might prove to be a lot of work for a few basis points of additional return and observes that treasurers are not incentivised on the returns they generate on excess liquidity placements.</p>
<p>“Why should they take unconsidered or unreasonable risks if it does not pay off in terms of bonuses?” he continues. “Treasurers should determine the corporate’s risk appetite and tolerance and adopt products to achieve the objectives in terms of return within the agreed parameters.”</p>



<h2 class="h3 copy__heading">What are the main challenges faced by treasurers looking to integrate ESG principles into their cash investments?</h2>

<p>Treasurers need to take into account not only the risk/return profile, but also the qualitative aspects of the ESG strategies and projects of corporates they are investing in according to Alexandra Wentzinger, Product Manager Deposits at BNP Paribas Cash Management.</p>
<p>“Integrating extra-financial analysis (defined as systematic assessment of corporate governance, environmental and social responsibility) into the valuation process is important but challenging given the variety of inputs and large range of activities and objectives set by the UN’s sustainable development goals, for example,” she says.</p>
<p>However, issuers have gradually adapted their internal procedures and processes to fulfil ESG requirements while providing regular feedback and reports to investors.</p>
<p>In October 2020, Citi launched green deposits. Stephen Randall, the bank’s Global Head of Liquidity Management Services, says this and other initiatives reflect the fact that sustainable investing is entering the mainstream.</p>
<p>“Sustainability is becoming the responsibility of the entire organisation – including treasury – which is impacting treasury investment strategies,” he says, adding that treasurers are uniquely positioned to link corporates’ liquidity requirements to sustainability goals.</p>
<p>They first need to do due diligence on the various cash investment options in the market and align them with the firm’s broader ESG goals. “Then they need to look at the liquidity characteristics of these options – some products may have the right characteristics from an ESG perspective, but treasurers need to know how easy it is to access the liquidity as and when required and how the products fit into their investment policies,” says Randall.</p>
<p>Nicolas Cailly, Head of Marketing for Payments &amp; Cash Management, Global Transaction Banking at Societe Generale, refers to a strong link between ESG, external perceptions of the corporate, and fundamental treasury responsibilities.</p>
<p>“On the cash investments side, there are plenty of solutions that incorporate an ESG dimension,” he says. “The challenge for treasurers is to understand and classify the existing ESG offer and to find investment products that also meet the corporate’s liquidity and return constraints. Integration of ESG investments into treasurers’ allocation choices will take time and they will need more support from their banking partners.”</p>


<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>

<p>Of course, the focus for treasury should always be on optimising the available cash for working capital and strategic purposes – especially when the company needs access to cash on a regular basis to fund expansion, as is the case at NewCold Advanced Cold Logistics in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>“The treasury mandate set out by the board sets the boundaries and this can be more aggressive, but not so much that it endangers business continuity,” says Richard Blokland, NewCold’s Corporate Treasurer. “When we have surplus cash available to invest externally, our favoured products include money market funds and bonds.”</p>
<p>According to Ole Matthiessen, Head of Cash Management at Deutsche Bank, treasury policy should operate independently of the interest rate environment.</p>
<p>“Nevertheless, the onset of inflation could result in treasurers exploring options such as considering a floating rate strategy or a strategy that increases tenor, but keeps the interest rate reset period to a short tenor,” he says. “Beyond this (and in particular when anticipating a potential change in rates) treasurers should consider the possibility to match the investment interest period against the borrowing interest period.”</p>
<p>In cases where treasurers struggle with the accuracy of their data within cash flow modelling and forecasting, it is prudent to ensure a credit facility is in place on an overnight or short term basis to ensure spikes or unexpected cash requirements can be managed without disrupting the overall liquidity strategy.</p>
<p>Implementing transformational practices such as in-house banks is another option for treasurers looking to ensure optimal levels of liquidity for day-to-day needs while thinking strategically about appropriate avenues for surpluses.</p>
<p>Established products like physical cash concentration and notional pooling introduce automation of cash movement where, when and in the currency needed, explains Lori Schwartz, Global Head of Liquidity Solutions, Account Services and Escrow at J.P. Morgan.</p>
<p>“Combined with digital-first solutions such as virtual accounts, treasuries can create efficiency in their inter-company models and optimise use of working capital,” she says. “When treasuries centralise it is possible to materially reduce cash on deposit accounts and consider alternate uses such as investing it in the business.”</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the pandemic we have seen the emergence of ultra-short fixed income funds in the institutional space as part of the quest for yield. Corporate treasurers are also putting money into products including ETFs that invest in very short-dated debt such as treasury bills.</p>
<p>“Money market funds are still a hugely important element in the overnight funding toolkit for corporate treasurers, but it is safe to say that they are now being complemented with a range of other investment options that are giving treasurers a little more discretion and control over their cash management,” says George Maganas, Head of Liquidity &amp; Segregation at BNY Mellon.</p>
<p>Lauren Oakes, Global Co-head of the liquidity solutions client business within Goldman Sachs Asset Management, agrees that treasurers do not (and should not) change their risk appetite for liquidity due to macro factors in isolation.</p>
<p>One area in which she has seen renewed interest from treasurers in light of the prolonged low/negative rate environment is balance sheet cash segmentation. Once the operational (or ‘primary’) cash requirements are accounted for in accessible deposits and short term money market funds, treasurers are exploring options for investing their strategic cash.</p>
<p>“The ultimate liquidity solution can include a range of strategies from ultra-short duration on the more conservative end to multi-asset class/longer duration strategies on the higher risk end of spectrum,” adds Oakes.</p>
<p>UniCredit advises clients to cluster company liquidity into three different levels: operational liquidity, buffer liquidity, and structural liquidity. It sees sight deposits (a bank deposit that can be withdrawn immediately without notice or penalty) as remaining the optimal solution for operational liquidity, which has a time horizon of only a few days.</p>
<p>Capital protection, positive yields and an acceptable issuer quality are now possible only with tenors which are longer than maturities consistent with the strategic and commercial plan of most corporates.</p>
<p>For this reason, UniCredit advises clients to manage their liquidity through either assets under management or assets under custody instruments observes Sergio Ravich Calafell, the bank’s Global Head of Corporate Treasury Sales.</p>
<p>“The former is a portfolio of mutual funds chosen to fit the client’s requirements in terms of time horizon, mark-to-market volatility, asset allocation, issuers rating and target yield,” he explains. “The latter is a portfolio of securities bought on primary and secondary markets with short tenor and a yield that is linked to the performance of a specific underlying or a basket of underlyings.”</p>
<p>Treasurers focused on return ‘of’ capital rather than return ‘on’ capital should focus on optimising existing structures according to Karen Ly, head of global liquidity specialists at Bank of America global transaction services.</p>
<p>“The strategies treasures could contemplate in this environment include using deposits to minimise bank fees and reducing operating risks and interest expense associated with overdrafts,” she says. “We recommend that treasurers centralise their liquidity positions on a daily basis where permitted by local regulations to minimise idle cash and allow them to pay down external debt to reduce interest charges.”</p>
<p>Ly also recommends defining sweep parameters that fund local operations and extracting surplus cash on a ‘just-in-time’ basis across entities, countries and currencies. “Dollar functional businesses should regularly review their repatriation strategies to capitalise on global reinvestment or redeployment opportunities,” she adds.</p>



<h2 class="h3 copy__heading">Case Study</h2>
<p><img alt="li auto logo" class="org" height="" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/logo-2/lixiang-logo-1100x500.png?la=en&amp;hash=6B583171EA55B021AACFC48A9AD44D57" style="margin-top:;" title="li-auto logo" width="80"/></p>
<p>Li Auto is a market leader in the design, development, manufacturing and sale of premium electric vehicles in China. It recorded revenues of US$546m in the first quarter of this year and forecasts revenues of US$609-652m for Q221.</p>
<p>“The most important elements of our liquidity management strategy are efficiency, accessibility and optimisation and we have implemented domestic and cross border cash pooling to achieve these goals,” explains the company’s Treasury Director, Hugh Hu, who says he is sanguine about low interest rates and predictions of higher inflation.</p>
<p>“As an advanced technology company, we need to invest a lot in development so low interest rates are beneficial as we can leverage investment funding at a low cost,” he says. “However, uncertainty around global inflation has increased pressure on treasury due to rising costs. A liquidity management solution that can provide certainty of funding access whenever required is the most important tool we can rely on to mitigate the related liquidity risks.”</p>
<p>At the beginning of the pandemic, Li Auto leveraged RMB cross-border pooling to get offshore funding to support the challenging operating environment in China.</p>
<p>The RMB cross-border cash pooling structure – provided by Citi – is the main artery for processing inter-company flows between the China domestic business and the offshore business.</p>
<p>“This has saved us significant financing costs on an annual basis,” says Hu. “Based on the initial development of this liquidity management programme, Citi helped us get approval from our regulator to add the variable interest entities of the group into this arrangement.”</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>The 2020 travails of cruise ship operator Carnival read like a case study in cash and liquidity management. Over the last year, the company has raised over US$22bn in emergency funding to stay afloat in a sweeping liquidity strategy. At first it was just about survival, executing capital market transactions with the highest likelihood of success in a highly challenging environment which wouldn’t handcuff the company in the years to come. Next, the priority was debt transactions that fitted Carnival’s maturity towers with the flexibility to pre-pay, followed by debt conversions as the economic environment began to improve. Most recently, and with dry land finally in sight as the vaccines roll out and the company has begun to sell cruises again, Carnival has stepped back into the unsecured market able to issue bonds not backed by its ships or other assets once again. “Stressful?” asks Darrell Campbell incredulously. “That is the understatement of the year.”</p>
<h3 id="one-shot">One shot</h3>
<p>Survival, and what turned out to just be the start of the process, involved securing a comprehensive combination of debt, equity and convertible debt via a package of over US$6.5bn in early April 2020. “We had one shot to convince investors,” recalls Campbell, speaking from his home in Miami, Florida, explaining that his key consideration at that time was making sure there was enough equity underpinning the capital structure, and navigating a pivot to the secured debt market when the unsecured debt market abruptly closed.</p>
<p>Generating financial models based around different scenarios in such a period of huge unknowns was hard enough. Add in articulating them “on the flack” to a new and unknown investor group and it turned positively challenging. “The group of investors we were targeting were high-yield. Even though our credit rating was still investment grade, we looked like a high-yield company. Our messaging had to be precise, our timing had to be precise and planning for what came next had to be precise.”</p>
<p>The cost of shoring up liquidity was certainly eye watering. On one hand Carnival was locked into a higher rate of borrowing than normal on a secured basis – although the team set this at three years with the view that the company would then be able to refinance at a more favourable rate and without collateral. On the other, a necessary US$600m equity offering in early April coincided with a historic low in the stock price. “Given the circumstances, this was our best course of action. We had to make sure we had the liquidity,” says Campbell.</p>
<p>Two months later and another swathe of transactions followed with Carnival approaching a new set of investors with US dollar and euro term loan B issuances for a combined US$2.8bn last June. This time the debt was structured to give the company the flexibility to pre-pay with call options in anticipation of the recovery. Meanwhile, as Carnival’s outlook began to improve because of its stronger liquidity position, the next tranche of debt came at a better rate.</p>
<p>Come August, the team started to approach investors to convert the debt issued in the heat of the crisis to equity. “This was important to help us deleverage,” he says, adding how timing on this seam of the strategy also coincided with a rebound in the company’s share price to US$14 a share from a low of US$7.80.</p>
<p>In the next wave of financing, against the backdrop of the continued rebound in the share price, Carnival launched a US$1bn ATM programme, followed by another US$1.5bn in October. “When we got to September, we started looking at ways to issue more common stock,” says Campbell. “By this time, we had enough liquidity even in the worst-case scenario and news of the vaccine was starting to come out.” At which point the company also began restarting cruises off Italy and Germany. It was also able to opportunistically return to the unsecured debt market, borrowing US$2bn in November in a bond offering not backed by its ships.</p>
<h3 id="cutting-costs">Cutting costs</h3>
<p>Cutting costs is just as important in successful liquidity management. Carnival has sold 19 older and less efficient ships over the past year. Admittedly the vessels only represent 3% of the company’s operating income, but not paying servicing costs meaningfully impacts the company’s cost structure. “The new ships coming in are larger and more efficient. This will help to further improve our cost structure as we return to service,” says Campbell. Elsewhere, while maintaining compliance, environmental protection and safety, the company significantly reduced its operating and general and administrative costs and deferred all unnecessary capital expenditure.</p>
<p>As for those new vessels already under construction, the team has put in place deferrals of some principle payments with Export Credit Agencies and banks. “It’s in the best interests of ECAs that we continue to operate successfully and build ships in their countries,” he says.</p>
<p>At the end of last November, Campbell says the company had around US$9.5bn in liquidity. With an estimated Q121 cash burn of US$600m a month, he is confident that even in the unlikely event Carnival’s revenues continue to languish through 2021, the current cash pile will be enough to get the company through the year. Crediting the strategy to his small treasury team working alongside a broader finance, Counsel and legal team within the company plus investment banking partners, he says he will continue to look at opportunistic transactions around refinancing higher coupon debt through the course of the year.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Carnival’s strategy is an extreme example of liquidity management for a company caught in the eye of a storm. But scratch beneath the surface, and corporates the world over have plotted a similar course, prioritising liquidity via debt issuance and refinancing costly debt wherever possible. Cheap borrowing costs and easy access to the capital markets meant companies, including banks, raised more than US$6.37trn from investors last year, according to data provider Refinitiv. Elsewhere, Moody’s data reveals cash holdings of US companies has hit a record high due to higher borrowing to bolster liquidity and/or to pre-fund upcoming debt maturities. “In 2020, the top five cash holders remain Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook,” says Richard Lane, a Moody’s senior vice president.</p>
<p>Moreover, the pace of issuance shows no signs of slowing. With no signs that the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank or Bank of England will increase interest rates any time soon, companies are still using the opportunity to buy back shorter dated bonds and pay down term loans to re-finance with longer dated bonds. Giulio Baratta, Head of DCM Ccorporates at BNP Paribas, says his key focus remains helping companies support their backup liquidity facilities, and refinance in the debt capital markets. “The first priority is liquidity, then balance sheet strengthening,” he says. “We were expecting volumes to start to decrease in 2021, but we haven’t seen that trend yet.”</p>
<p>Nor is investor appetite to lend to companies starting to wane. In fact, many investors are comfortable going down the capital structure and buying subordinated, riskier debt, indicative from inflows into both investment grade and sub-investment grade funds, he says. “Investors were expecting less supply. So far this year they are still supporting transactions although we notice a little more scrutiny in terms of value. Companies will continue to spot opportunities for refinancing, maturity lengthening and locking in these very low rates. We are in a strong position in the debt capital markets and there is only a marginal cost to refinancing.”</p>
<h3 id="m-and-a">M&amp;A</h3>
<p>Although Carnival has allocated every drop of its liquidity to staying afloat, other companies have enough on hand to explore different strategies. Piles of corporate cash hoarded as a cushion against falling revenues could now spark a visible pick up in M&amp;A activity, suggests Baratta, who says more enquires around acquisition finance are starting to filter through at the bank, and that a spike in M&amp;A activity is a “core” 2021 expectation amongst the team. It could be either defensive, or M&amp;A activity triggered by companies seeking growth via acquisitions, particularly amongst those struggling to boost revenues, he predicts. “M&amp;A can be a good way of aggregating a business in certain sectors and companies might seek to build their footprint geographically.”</p>
<p>Others are more cautious however, citing ongoing uncertainty and companies perceiving “getting back to normal” as more of a priority than any corporate transformation. “M&amp;A could be difficult to justify in quite a few sectors,” warns Paul Watters, Head of EMEA Credit Research at S&amp;P Global Ratings. Campbell certainly doesn’t predict meaningful M&amp;A activity in the cruise ship sector, although he qualifies this could be more a consequence of the fact the industry only has three big players as it is. All have secured liquidity runways, and with vaccines and recovery in sight, things will soon return to normal, he predicts. “Assuming we all successfully navigate this period – which is my strong expectation – I don’t imagine big players will do M&amp;A. We make up most of the industry and I don’t expect a massive consolidation.”</p>
<h3 id="invest">Invest</h3>
<p>Treasury teams could use their cash on hand to invest in the business. Climate change is certainly a pressing issue. The OECD estimates that US$6.9trn a year is required up to 2030 to meet climate and development objectives. Companies that have drawn up future proof, strategic climate strategies including plans for investment to meet accelerating structural trends are emerging as industry leaders. “Anyone wanting to show leadership in their industry in an industrial sense also needs to show leadership in tackling climate change and in their ESG ambition,” says Baratta, who highlights investors increasing preference for best-in-class corporates and those with a solid ESG strategy.</p>
<p>Yet S&amp;P’s Watters says signs of companies using cash to invest have yet to emerge. The latest analysis sees no broad corporate themes regarding capital investment or more particularly in mitigating climate change, he says. “Capital investment continues to be very weak in many sectors. There is still a lot of uncertainty as to when the recovery will become sustainable.”</p>
<p>Payouts to investors given the equity rally could make a comeback, suggests Baratta. “If current valuations come under stress, there could be a rationale for supporting stock.” Not surprisingly, 2020 was the worst year for dividends since the financial crisis, as companies suspended or cut payouts to conserve cash. It remains to be seen whether treasury teams are confident enough of what lies ahead to start to reward investors again; besides, businesses that received state support during the crisis remain under pressure not to reward shareholders too quickly.</p>
<h3 id="credit-rating">Credit rating</h3>
<p>One of Carnival’s priorities is to strengthen its credit rating, restoring its investment grade rating by reducing its debt pile and repairing the balance sheet. Carnival’s rating has fallen to B (bonds rated double B plus and below are known as high-yield, or junk) and “as long as markets remain favourable,” Campbell says he wants to try and repair the damage. “Our goal is to rebuild our balance sheet and return to an investment grade credit rating over time. We have historically maintained a strong investment grade credit rating to absorb temporary shocks. As it was, having that balance sheet strength enabled us to absorb some of the COVID impacts.”</p>
<p>It’s a nod to the sharp difference in market access the company felt when it was forced to tap high-yield investors. A strong credit rating provides access to a far larger pool of investors and typically means lower borrowing costs. Most recently, it has also come with central bank support given central banks began buying investment-grade rated companies to support the bond market in the wake of the pandemic.</p>
<p>The best way to improve a credit rating and a company’s financial risk profile is to pay off debt, says Watters. He adds that credit ratings are based on many factors including the state of the industry, the company’s competitive position therein, and its profitability. The pandemic’s impact on growth and earnings has put credit metrics out of kilter and companies’ financial risk profiles under pressure – especially those with weaker ratings. “The obvious way to improve a financial risk profile given the disruption caused by the pandemic is to improve earnings and cash flow,” he advises. As to whether companies are using their piles of cash built up over the past year to cushion them against falls in income, he hasn’t noticed any particular trends yet. For now, key themes include some large companies starting to pay back government support that they may have received. But with little opportunity cost from raising debt and holding cash, most are simply choosing to stockpile liquidity until the business outlook becomes clearer, he says.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>There is no doubt that businesses like Carnival and others in hard hit sectors have had it tough. But Watters concludes with a thought for speculative grade corporates and SMEs for whom the capital markets have not been a source of largesse. They have burnt through cash, raised finance through the government loan schemes, and are in a much more vulnerable position. “Many SMEs are seeing their top line under huge pressure and their earnings and cash flow affected. Many have taken on more debt, and so from a credit perspective, their overall credit quality has weakened.” Indeed, he sees a litany of business failures ahead. “A lot of SMEs may not have a strong enough business model to see them through the recovery. It’s not really a liquidity issue – it’s more about having a sustainable capital structure given their business model in a post pandemic world.”</p>

<p>Among the many changes prompted by the COVID-19 crisis, one significant development is a shift away from traditional payment channels. In recent months, lockdowns and social distancing requirements have changed payment behaviour for both consumer and businesses – and as a result, treasurers are having to work proactively to embrace newer payment channels.</p>
<p>“All transactions that have a high touch element, such as cheques, have become difficult to handle during lockdown, as people haven’t been able to access their offices or go to the bank branch,” says Mahesh Kini, Managing Director, Head – Cash Management, Asia Pacific at BNP Paribas. “In markets like India, we have seen volumes come down by 40-45% during the pandemic.” Likewise, Kini says the use of paper instructions bearing wet signatures has reduced significantly, while the use of physical supporting documents in cross-border transactions has also declined.</p>
<p>At the same time, many traditional retail businesses have seen a rapid shift from physical branches to ecommerce sales models. “Some of the luxury brand retailers from France, for example, are now selling their products either on their own commerce portal, or even via third party channels,” comments Kini. “From a payment perspective, corporates now need to be able to handle new payment channels, so this shift has driven quite a bit of transformation in the payments landscape.”</p>
<h4 id="from-aggregation-to-e-banking">From aggregation to e-banking</h4>
<p>These shifts are leading to new trends in how corporations manage payments. Kini points to an increase in the use of third-party payment aggregators which are able to aggregate all types of alternative payments, including wallets, peer-to-peer transfers and credit card acquiring. “Payment aggregators are now operating in most of the markets in Asia Pacific and are physically facilitating payment flows,” he notes.</p>
<p>Another trend is the rise of real-time payments. Most markets in Asia Pacific are now equipped with real-time payments systems – and while many of these are restricted to B2C flows due to transaction value limits, other markets, such as Singapore, have higher limits and are better able to support B2B transactions.</p>
<p>As Kini notes, there has also been a rapid increase in the use of e-banking channels for sending payment instructions and submitting digital documents – “so those documents which have come in paper formats in the past are now being digitalised into images or data and submitted via e-banking channels to the banks.”</p>
<h4 id="priorities-and-challenges">Priorities and challenges</h4>
<p>For treasurers, the rise of new payment channels brings considerable challenges. “Businesses are demanding acceptance of these new payment channels, but their ERP systems and treasury platforms are not fully geared up for this kind of instant flow coming into them, or the need to make instant payments,” says Kini.</p>
<p>In addition, as they seek to marry up new payment channels and legacy platforms, Kini says treasurers need to keep a close eye on payment risks. “As businesses move away from shop front to ecommerce models, the risk of fraud and cybercrime is all the greater,” he comments. “So it is extremely important that while treasurers support their businesses, they also put in the necessary controls to manage these risks.”</p>
<p>When it comes to handling different payment channels, Kini says that banks have an important role to play in bringing solutions such as payment aggregation to their clients. “We have a platform which offers payment aggregation globally. So if there is a global client who wants to power their ecommerce platform with a payment engine, we are able to connect into their ecommerce portal using an API, and give them access to multiregional payment aggregation systems,” he says.</p>
<p>The use of payment aggregators can bring challenges where reporting and reconciliation is concerned – but again, banks can support companies in achieving more uniform reporting across their different payment channels. In addition, Kini notes that in an instant or near-instant world, there is a greater need for access to more sophisticated liquidity information and cash forecasting functionalities. </p>
<h4 id="impact-of-the-crisis">Impact of the crisis</h4>
<p>In today’s challenging environment, treasurers not only expect their banking partners to be able to connect to all relevant payment channels, but are also looking for banks that will work proactively with them to achieve their target operating model. And they are looking for quick results: Kini cites the example of a corporate client in the retail segment in Korea which needed to set up an ecommerce portal and implement a payment aggregator interface in just 30 days.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 crisis has also prompted a closer focus on liquidity. Kini says that when the pandemic began, treasurers were focusing on keeping liquidity close to their operating entities to cover any sudden funding needs. “But in the second half of the year, we have seen a different strategy: the focus is now on how to manage liquidity coming out of the newer payment channels,” he adds.</p>
<p>Linked to that, Kini says, is the need for faster cash forecasting. Companies that have previously managed forecasting using spreadsheets are now seeking technology and platforms that can support near-real-time forecasting, thereby enabling more effective liquidity management.</p>
<h4 id="here-to-stay">Here to stay?</h4>
<p>The current environment has brought significant changes for payments and liquidity – but are these changes here to stay? “I don’t think we will go back to how things were before the crisis,” says Kini. “Some elements may return – for example, I don’t think cheques will completely disappear. But there will be a large proportion of transactions which will remain electronic.”</p>
<p>Likewise, the transition to ecommerce is likely to continue, with consumers becoming increasingly comfortable with this model. “And central banks are also strongly pushing the adoption of electronic and real-time payments,” Kini says. “A lot of lessons have been learnt across the different markets, and some of the practices which are being adopted now will become more established.”</p>

<p>‘If you fail to plan, you plan to fail’ applies aptly to liquidity planning now more than ever. Forecasting and liquidity planning is a fundamental task in treasury processes. Companies adapt their levels of forecasting based on needs – ranging from daily to yearly.</p>
<p>The following can be considered as key components of forecast and liquidity planning:</p>
<p><strong>Payments:</strong> representing the obligation of the entity and includes intra group and external suppliers. Payment calendars or fixed payment days help a lot in forecasting and controlling the cash needs.</p>
<p><strong>Collections:</strong> this is the most challenging part of forecasting, especially with external customers, since it involves several variables.</p>
<p><strong>Payroll and taxes:</strong> relatively fixed and generally obligatory, based on regulations in specific countries. Entities should carefully consider any incentives, subsidies, tax recovery and tax benefits applicable in respective countries.</p>
<p>Credit facilities: treasurers need to recognise the difficulty of organising new, or increasing existing credit facilities in the very short term, as financial institutions face liquidity challenges and market risks are priced in. Supply chain financing and factoring arrangements will also help greatly on forecasting and liquidity planning.</p>
<p>It is recommended to follow a ‘LIQUID’ approach, in gaining access to valuable data.</p>
<h4 id="l-limited-demand">L – Limited demand</h4>
<p>Try to use existing reports or data, to minimise additional requests to different teams. Similar to treasury, other teams are also likely to have new challenges in times of a crisis, alongside their regular work demands.</p>
<h4 id="i-information-flow">I – Information flow</h4>
<p>It’s suggested that the information flow should be direct from the person who holds the data or creates the report to the treasury team. The information flow should include a feedback mechanism, which will help to fine tune data wherever possible. To facilitate easy flow and to ensure minimal additional effort, information can be accessed from common drives or systems, or the treasury team could be simply added in copy of an email.</p>
<h4 id="q–quick-turnaround">Q – Quick turnaround</h4>
<p>To achieve quick access to information, treasurers need to trade-off between actual numbers to the last dollar versus estimated value. For example, the precise amount for value added tax payable is generally available just on the day itself or one day before, whereas rough estimates can be obtained at quite an early stage.</p>
<h4 id="u–understand-the-business">U – Understand the business</h4>
<p>It is important to understand the business model and product lines well, to appreciate the flows better and to realise any possible impacts due to the market situation. Often, this may not be a favourite area for finance teams or those working in regional centre atmospheres and away from the central businesses. Strong partnership and close communication with local teams will help a lot in this regard.</p>
<h4 id="i–integrate-the-systems-wherever-possible">I – Integrate the systems wherever possible</h4>
<p>It is possible that companies end up with multiple different systems for various processes, which may not interact with each other. Typically, the situation is more complex in large entities with different levelled versions. Integrating the information flow between different software is key to eliminating manual processing as well as the related delays and errors.</p>
<h4 id="d–differences-to-be-recognised">D – Differences to be recognised</h4>
<p>It is important to understand differences in objectives between various contributors, so treasurers can better appreciate the data and use it effectively. For example, credit teams are likely to focus on collecting funds within the invoice due date, whereas treasury is more focused on the value date of receiving funds.</p>

<p>Today, the role of treasurers has never been more important as businesses deal with the impact of the coronavirus and how crucial it is for them to forecast and manage their liquidity effectively to navigate through this period. Liquidity forecasting is a complex practice and there are many factors treasurers need to consider during the process.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Obtaining visibility of funds</strong> – the operations of MNCs are growing in complexity with multiple entities across different markets, currencies and time zones. Coupled with acquisitions and numerous banking relationships, it is vital to have visibility of their cash positions across the globe.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Efficient data gathering</strong> – treasurers should invest in capabilities that enable them to extract meaningful intelligence from the data generated through their operations. A common challenge is trying to aggregate a large volume of data across different sources and in different formats. Timeliness of data is also essential in ensuring they are receiving real-time insights in order to prepare for unexpected fluctuations in cash flow.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Strong business partner relationships</strong> – it is critical to keep strong stakeholder relationships with other business units within the organisation. It is imperative these business units recognise the importance of forecasting and take accountability in providing accurate information. Frequent and open lines of communication will educate and build knowledge of how forecasting ensures the organisation has sufficient funding at all times, and anticipate the likeliness of last minute requests which can then be handled with minimum disruption to cash flow.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Use the most effective method</strong> – a number of corporates are still using spreadsheets. although in recent years corporates have slowly started migrating to more sophisticated treasury platforms which can gather records from multiple sources, create consistent information and hold vast amounts of data though cloud software. This technology also allows for automation and easier trend analysis providing treasurers with the ability to make informed decisions about liquidity management.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Trend analysis</strong> – segmenting transaction flows is useful in tailoring the forecasting model further. For example, treasurers can section flows which are short term commitments related to the day-to-day operations of the business and likely to be reoccurring and longer-term commitments such as capital repayments and maturing investments. Identifying seasonal trends and behavioural patterns will help refine the model, reduce the element of surprise and increase predictability of cash flow requirements.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><em>“There is an ongoing digital revolution in the supply chain finance space. What should treasurers be aware of?”</em></p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>

<p>Cash flow is the “lifeblood” of any company, according to Ray Suvrodeep, Global Head of Deposit &amp; Investments Product Management at HSBC. In the first two weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic hitting Europe, ratings agency S&amp;P reviewed 20% of its portfolio, downgrading or putting on negative watch or outlook some 75% of the reviewed companies. It became evident that companies that couldn’t demonstrate a steady cash flow would suffer not only because of dried up demand, but also from ratings scars.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for treasurers, there is no way to forecast future cash flows with 100% accuracy. As Shafiq Abdul Jabbar, CFO at Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd (AMH) explains, “The future outlook is always fraught with many variables, some controllable and some not.” He also notes that there is an added dimension with this, as volatilities are not constant across time.</p>
<p>Dino Nicolaides, Managing Director, Head of Treasury Advisory UK&amp;I at Redbridge Debt &amp; Treasury Advisory, agrees, explaining that even with effective forecasting tools in place, a company can never be sure where it will land. One example, he says, is the airline industry. Airlines are particularly sensitive to a lot of factors. They produce forecasts on passenger numbers, fuel costs, staffing, lease costs of planes, to name a few. “All of a sudden, a pandemic like COVID-19 happens, and everything is grounded – so all forecasts go out the window,” he explains.</p>
<p>Of course, pandemics aren’t the only thing that can have this effect. For example, a terrorist attack or a global recession may stop many people travelling, Nicolaides adds. The speed with which these events unfold can put treasurers in a difficult position where forecasting is concerned.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-accurate-enough">What is ‘accurate enough’?</h4>
<p>For Abdul Jabbar, every forecast is just a “best estimate” at a point in time. The key for him is keeping a closer eye on the controllable items, whilst simulating possible scenarios for the uncontrollable. He adds that it’s also essential to manage the residual risks to an acceptable level within the available capacity of the organisation, using third-party tools where possible.</p>
<p>Nicolaides agrees and says that the question of what is accurate enough is a common one in his line of work. “It all depends on what decisions you make off the back of your forecasts,” he says. Forecasts have so many uses (for example, liquidity management, foreign exchange hedging, setting strategic objectives), and so treasurers need to establish exactly what they’re using the forecast for before they can establish its efficacy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Suvrodeep explains that the most common issue with cash forecasting comes from the “single version of truth”, whereby the treasury’s understanding of the forecast is different to that of the business units. But, he says that the goal around accuracy begins with improvement from current, unsatisfactory levels, and transitions into maintaining the desired levels in a cost-effective fashion. “The actual target is very much dependent on the individual company,” he says. Treasurers, and CFOs, need to assess if they can rely on the forecast to make decisions.</p>
<p>Suvrodeep adds that in practical terms, there is a natural trade-off between accuracy and the time horizon of the forecast. “Treasury strives for greater accuracy of its short-term forecast – say end of current week up to 13 weeks – as granular data and business outlook is more readily available,” he explains. “For forecasts over longer horizons, directional accuracy and visibility over material movements are the areas to focus on.”</p>
<h4 id="communication-is-key">Communication is key</h4>
<p>When it comes to overcoming challenges and improving forecasting models, Nicolaides says there are four main things he advises treasurers to do. The first is to regularly re-evaluate the forecasting data that is required after business needs change. “People at the centre should always think about and review what information they really need to get out of their business units in the various countries and continents,” he says.</p>
<p>The second – perhaps the biggest forecasting challenge that corporates face – is educating the various global teams that are necessary to accurate forecasting. “Treasurers rely on all these teams to give the information needed to forecast, but unless these teams are educated on all the reasons the information is needed and is valuable to the organisation, and what exactly is done with it, they’ll be less inclined to ensure it’s accurate,” he explains.</p>
<p>That then leads into his third point, which is to reinforce the positive behaviours around forecasting by monitoring the forecasts that are given. For example, a treasurer sitting in Europe who asks for a forecast from a team member in Asia every month should be following up on the results of that forecast. “If they never ask, ‘last month the forecast was 60% out, why was that?’, and never give that feedback, then the treasurer in Asia will never have the incentive to give credible forecasts,” he says. But if the Asia treasurer knows that they’ll be asked about it, they will think twice when putting in the forecasts.</p>
<p>This not only ensures every team member involved in the forecasting process is working accurately and effectively, but also gives valuable learning experiences. “I always say that monitoring should be done not just by comparing forecasts and actual data, but also by comparing originally forecasted data and revised forecasted data,” he adds. This is especially important for long-term forecasts which can be significantly affected by rapid changes such as COVID-19.</p>
<p>Lastly, Nicolaides believes that it’s important to build forecasting accuracy into people’s key performance indicators (KPIs), as another incentive to make them care about making the forecasts as accurate as possible. “If it has no impact on their KPIs, they will probably never spend the relevant attention on it,” he says. In order to do this, of course, management support is essential. “Management need to give the relevant support to forecasting and dictate within the organisation that this is a very important part of the business that needs to be as accurate as possible.”</p>
<h4 id="the-rise-of-the-machines">The rise of the machines</h4>
<p>As with many aspects of treasury, technology is an essential part of forecasting. Abdul Jabbar explains that cash flow visibility at AMH was significantly improved after the establishment of an in-house bank (IHB) – which saw AMH named Highly Commended Winner in the First Class Relationship Management category of the 2019 Adam Smith Awards Asia. Key to the IHB is the automated reconciliation structure that simplified liquidity management and allowed for improved cash visibility. “By leveraging the IHB, we have managed to advance our forecasting models by having precise information of liquidity positions, improving both capital and liquidity management,” he explains.</p>
<p>The automation of processes is a key step in adopting more technology to improve forecasting, says Nicolaides. The automation of manual processes can allow treasurers to regain valuable time. But more important, he says, is the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).</p>
<p>ML has the ability to identify data anomalies and ignore them, recognising that they are the exception to the rule and not the norm. ML can also identify flexibility in payment times. For example, if a company makes an annual payment every January, but is slightly short of cash one year, through ML the system might identify that in the previous five years the payment has actually had flexibility between January and March. ML can also help to identify committed and avoidable outflows, which may help when companies are strapped for cash. Lastly, it can identify surplus cash for investment over a specified period of time.</p>
<p>Indeed, ML has enormous potential in the treasury space more generally: in Deloitte’s 2019 Global Treasury Survey, 61% of respondents said ML was ‘critical’ or ‘important’ to treasury, and 56% believed they were ‘well versed’ in or had a ‘general understanding’ of the technology.</p>
<p>Despite these encouraging figures, 66% of respondents said that they weren’t using ML at all, and there was an equal 15% for both having ‘a whole dedicated team or a few in-house experts’, and ‘currently educating existing staff or looking for new talent’. Of those that have adopted AI and ML, 46% said they had either already implemented or were very likely to implement it, believed that it was especially relevant to ‘forecasting, financial planning, back and stress testing, and model validation’.</p>
<p>“In this space, the approach we are taking is evolutionary,” says Suvrodeep. “It involves breaking down the forecasting value chain into its constituent parts and then assessing where AI or ML can solve real-world problems, whilst not expecting treasury staff to be data scientists themselves!”</p>
<p>Suvrodeep notes that AI and ML still has a way to go, but that companies with strong and consistent seasonality in their cash flows can find that the technologies offer a significant forecasting edge. But, says Abdul Jabbar, it’s important to note that history is not always the best indicator of the future. In order to ensure the most accurate and effective forecasting data provision and analysis, it’s prudent to also look at unexpected scenarios.</p>
<h4 id="the-future-of-forecasting">The future of forecasting</h4>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic, and the resulting turmoil, has increased the focus on technology, says Abdul Jabbar. “It has highlighted the need for greater digitisation, real-time transactions and data to monitor cash flows at any point, and the ability to react immediately when conditions warrant a change.”</p>
<p>Suvrodeep agrees and says that the pandemic has drawn attention to the importance of contingency planning, which goes hand-in-hand with liquidity planning exercises such as cash forecasting.</p>
<p>Nicolaides believes the future will be a mixture of both. “For me, the future is having a cash flow forecasting process using technology and with a level of accuracy that cannot just give you what you need for making day-to-day decisions, but can also act as a very useful tool when something unprecedented happens, like COVID-19.”</p>
<p>Regardless of how cash forecasting develops, it’s clear that utilising technology to improve the forecasting process is going to become unavoidable for treasurers. Adopting it sooner will allow companies to progress with technological advancements, rather than having to catch up after.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>

<p>Asia is considered the most dynamic economic region in the world by the IMF, although the COVID-19 pandemic is causing a downturn projection for south Asia. However, the continent also contains the top three countries for unbanked populations globally (China, India and Pakistan), and a significant proportion of those people rely on cash and cheques, as opposed to electronic fund transfers, cards and other payment methods.</p>
<p>Despite that, and demonstrating the variety in the region, Asia is also home to the top three countries with mobile payment, with China, India and Indonesia ranking in that order. As such, it makes sense that the region would also be leading the corporate payments revolution. Under various monetary authorities, Asia’s real-time clearing systems have been developing rapidly. India has the Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) as well as the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), whilst Malaysia has Real-time Retail Payments Platform (RPP), Thailand has PromptPay, Singapore has Fast And Secure Transfers (FAST), and Hong Kong has Faster Payment System (FPS).</p>
<h4 id="asias-rapid-progression">Asia’s rapid progression</h4>
<p>For Honnus Cheung, Co-founder of fintech Mojodomo, Asian countries are ahead in certain aspects of digitalisation, owing to the widespread acceptance of technology within the countries as a whole – not just in treasury. “We use mobile phones for everything now. So we prefer to conclude an entire transaction experience by mobile phone, rather than using computers,” she explains. In this sense, the consumer is driving the upgrades to the digital payment experience.</p>
<p>“If you’re a B2C business, it is necessary to have online payment channels or QR codes for scanning payments. Otherwise, you probably can’t do business in Asia – especially China or other countries where they are very mobile-savvy,” she says. Indeed, China’s rapid adoption of mobile payments through the likes of WeChat Pay and Alipay has been largely driven by the lack of card payments in the country – getting a credit card from a Chinese bank is a lengthy process, and there has long been a de facto ban on foreign payment service providers unless they issued co-branded cards with a domestic provider such as UnionPay (however, in February 2019 Mastercard secured Chinese government approval to enter the country’s electronic payment services market). Combined with the explosion of smartphone adoption, this meant that mobile payments were able to leapfrog traditional methods seen in countries such as the UK and US.</p>
<p>The value of real-time payments is obvious in terms of improving the speed of commerce, says Shirish Wadivkar, Global Head, Correspondent Banking Products, Standard Chartered. But he explains that the core change is in the data structure of the faster payment networks. “They carry more data – some boast full ISO 20022 compatibility – and are smarter, with full track and trace capability,” he says. These payment networks are open and allow for integration of third parties, which makes it easier for consumers to pay using aliases such as mobile numbers and national IDs. At the same time, they offer more transparency into payments, and more information on why the payment has happened. “This naturally leads to improving the entire experience between buyers, sellers, and their banks,” Wadivkar says.</p>
<p>Ankur Kanwar, Regional Head, Cash Products, Singapore and ASEAN at Standard Chartered, also notes the rapid development of payment infrastructure in Asia, and believes it’s only going to continue. “More countries will introduce real-time domestic payments, payment by proxy or scan and pay via QR codes in the next few years,” he says.</p>
<p>But as Kanwar notes, the regulation landscape also needs to adapt to facilitate these changes. From a treasury point of view, the region is characterised by a vast number of regulatory differences between countries. This makes cross-border payments more difficult, and Cheung, who was previously CFO at Travelzoo, notes that not every country is equally advanced in Asia. The continent has always been a region where differentiated geographical and sector regulations have added complexity to the work of treasurers.</p>
<h4 id="standardisation–or-lack-thereof">Standardisation – or lack thereof</h4>
<p>For Cheung, one of the main challenges in the payments space in Asia is the lack of standardisation of digital payment formats. “SWIFT makes it easier and is a secure network within financial institutions that has been used for many decades, but it is not real-time and has relatively high transactions fees,” she explains. “There are many fintech companies that can be used for cross-border payments, and there’s actually a mushroom of payment formats that can accept monies electronically across Asian geographies, but this is in turn presenting headaches in reconciliation for treasurers.”</p>
<p>In a May 2019 article, the MIT Technology Review stated that “the entire ecosystem needs to pull together” before real-time transactions can fully materialise in Asia. The region’s multiple currencies can also prove a hurdle. Unlike in Europe, where there are only really three main trading currencies – the euro, the pound sterling and the Swiss franc – Asia’s multiple currencies prove problematic as not all of them are internationally tradeable. Cheung does recognise that in comparison to Latin American currencies, Asian currencies are relatively stable, but adds that fluctuation by 3-5% a day is still normal – or on a monthly basis it can depreciate by 10-20%.</p>
<p>Kanwar agrees that the large differences in Asian currencies can be a challenge and explains that “each market in the region has multiple localised payment options, each with different infrastructure requirements, which makes payments consistency difficult to achieve across the region.” In addition, he says that despite the digitalisation initiatives being undertaken by many corporations, challenges can arise from legacy infrastructures that have limitations on accepting 24/7/365 feeds.</p>
<p>Cheung notes that to some extent, treasurers and banks are very traditional professions, but they are recognising that in order to attract more customers they need to adapt and go digital. “Whatever product you’re launching, be it for corporate banking or consumer banking, you need to consider the digital – and mobile – perspective,” she says. This includes ensuring that the customer experience isn’t exceptional just because the payment journey is smooth, but also because it has good digital accessibility and a high level of security.</p>



<h2 class="h3 copy__heading">Case study: Japan</h2>

<p>Japan, described as “the market that should ignite but stubbornly refuses to”, has been far slower to adopt real-time payments than many thought it would. A 2016 study found that almost 70% of Japanese consumers across all ages preferred to make payments in cash. By contrast, only 40% of transactions in China are cash, whilst in South Korea that number falls to just 11%. The Japanese government’s ‘Cashless Vision’ aims to reduce this and get cashless payments to 40% by 2027.</p>
<p>In the private space, in 2019, Indian mobile payment firm Paytm announced that in its first six months, its Japanese arm, PayPay had gained about ten million users. To entice Japanese users to join the platform, PayPay has a points-based reward system as well as cash incentives. The company is also waiving fees for sellers and establishments until the end of 2021.</p>
<p>In the B2B space, American Express found that in Japan, promissory notes – a form of IOUs – are prominently used for payments. The same report cited findings from trade credit insurance firm Atradius’ 2017 Payments Practices Barometer that 33% of Japanese companies say payment procedure complexity is a main cause of delays when receiving international payments from overseas business partners. The 2019 Atradius Payments Practices Barometer for Japan noted that on average, B2B invoices are settled within 41 days from the invoice date – the second longest in Asia Pacific behind Taiwan, but five days shorter than in 2018.</p>


<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>

<h4 id="fintechs-to-the-rescue">Fintechs to the rescue?</h4>
<p>Of course, with more technology come bigger cyber-security risks. For real-time payments, a large amount of concern focuses on anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) checks, as fraudsters could seek to take advantage of any delay. The rapid and irreversible nature of faster payments means that suspicious activities may only be discovered after the funds have been sent, so businesses need to ensure that these checks are either done in advance or that the system is able to conduct necessary screenings in real time. Speedy AML and KYC checks are most likely achievable through intelligence-based analytic tools, and Cheung believes this is where fintechs really show their value. “Banks are proactively looking for fintechs to fill these gaps to provide a seamless digital customer journey to both B2C and B2B clients,” she explains. “[The banks] know they’re giant and can’t respond to the market quickly, so fintechs can help digitalise treasury systems in a much faster, cost efficient and timely manner around the globe, whilst also meeting cross-border AML requirements.”</p>
<p>Wadivkar agrees. “Despite being nascent, [fintechs/payment providers] are plugging gaps in value propositions that banks either could not or were slow in fixing,” he says. “Treasurers must consider this in their ongoing digital treasury challenges, even more so to gain real advantages in a post-COVID world.”</p>
<h4 id="real-time-is-here-to-stay">Real-time is here to stay</h4>
<p>The shift to real-time payments is irreversible, says Wadivkar. “Customer expectations of instant fulfilment are par for the course,” he adds. “This expectation has spilled over from personal to business payments and is now a reality.”</p>
<p>Cheung agrees, and believes that it’s no coincidence that this shift to real-time is coming as Gen Z and millennials begin to make up more of the workforce. “Millennials and Gen Z use their mobile phones for everything in their personal life, and they’re now using them for work as well,” she explains. It’s only natural that the people who have grown up with fast internet speeds and instant access to almost everything also want instant payments. Of course, it’s not just those generations driving the change, as people of all ages have mobile phones and are becoming more impatient as a result of faster networks speeds.</p>
<h4 id="teaching-opportunities">Teaching opportunities</h4>
<p>Other countries in EMEA and the Americas also have or are working towards their own real-time payments systems, and Wadivkar believes that some could learn a thing or two from the Asian payments market. “Asian networks are the pioneers in account aliases – that is, using common addressing for accounts instead of account numbers and sort codes (for example, IN, SG, MY),” he says. “This allows for better programmatic integration and more error-free payments.”</p>
<p>Wadivkar explains that to really progress in Asia, companies need to begin to move large, young populations and entrepreneurs across developing economies into global economic inclusion, employing the cheap mobile internet boom to provide democratic access to markets, thus driving wholesale prosperity across its masses. “The challenge is not only limited to the banks or market infrastructure,” he clarifies. “Treasurers have to also critically re-look at their technology and digital strategy going forward, to be able to truly translate the benefits of these major shifts in payments into returns.”</p>

<p><em>Making the best use of liquidity is an important goal for treasurers – but Asia’s complex landscape can present some significant challenges. From choosing suitable structures to leveraging the latest technology developments, how can treasurers optimise liquidity management across the region?</em></p>
<p>Liquidity management is a core activity for any treasurer: the more control treasurers have over their cash balances, the better use they can make of available funds – whether that means having a full and accurate view over the company’s balances at a regional level, or sweeping cash to a header account to reduce borrowing costs.</p>
<p>For treasurers in Asia, managing liquidity effectively can be particularly challenging. The complexity of the region’s disparate markets, currencies and regulators mean that gaining clear visibility over the company’s cash – and using that cash to minimise funding costs or optimise interest yield – tends to be less than straightforward.</p>
<p>That said, there is much that treasurers can do to optimise liquidity management, from putting the right structure in place to taking advantage of developments in technology.</p>
<h4 id="liquidity-management-goals">Liquidity management goals</h4>
<p>Making the best use of liquidity is an important goal for the region’s treasurers. “Liquidity management continues to be a key area of focus for corporate treasures in Asia with considerations ranging from the regulatory, legal and tax landscape to clearing system limitations and time zone difference vis-à-vis other regions,” says Venkat ES, head of Asia Treasury Product, Global Transaction Services, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofAML).</p>
<p>According to Venkat, the three key priorities for treasurers in Asia are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Visibility</strong> – ie the ability to view a consolidated balance position across accounts and deposits held in multiple banks, currencies and jurisdictions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Control and access</strong> – ie automated consolidation of funds (either physical or notional) across currencies and jurisdictions into designated regional pool headers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Returns</strong> – ie yield optimisation through enhancing returns on credit balances and reducing cost on debit balances.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Kee Joo Wong, Regional Head of Global Liquidity and Cash Management at HSBC Asia Pacific, notes that the centralisation of funds and visibility of cash can help treasurers forecast what is coming and plan for the future effectively. “There are some quick wins and economical ways of getting visibility, and it all comes down to how information is relayed to treasurers,” he says.</p>
<p>However, Adesh Sarup, Head of Transaction Banking, North Asia at ANZ Institutional, says that the existence of multiple countries and currencies – and differing yields across those currencies – makes it critical for treasurers to ensure they manage their liquidity risk and return appropriately.</p>
<p>To achieve this, Sarup says that “centralisation is the key” – especially when multiple legal entities and countries are involved – to streamlining systems across legal entities and banks. But he also points out that different companies will approach this differently: “While there is a bias towards centralisation, treasurers often stage their liquidity management goals based on the business model of their organisation,” he says. “For example, a highly federated organisation with localised receivables and payables would plan their liquidity management models differently from an organisation that has adopted a regional re-invoicing model.”</p>
<h4 id="restrictions-and-challenges">Restrictions and challenges</h4>
<p>Having clear goals is one thing – but it’s no secret that APAC presents a number of obstacles when it comes to effective liquidity management.</p>
<p>Venkat notes that the disparate jurisdictional landscape in Asia imposes a number of legal, regulatory and tax restrictions with respect to cross-entity, cross-border and cross-currency consolidation of funds. He explains: “These restrictions range from complete trapped cash in jurisdictions like India (where only physical domestic sweeps between same entity accounts in local currency are freely permitted) to less regulated markets like Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia where most liquidity structures can be automated.”</p>
<p>Some countries in the region are more challenging than others. Vijay Shankar, Head of Transaction Banking, ASEAN, India and Regional Sales at ANZ Institutional, says that the greatest challenges can be found in the countries where business opportunities are high, but cross-border capital flow restrictions are in place. “One would count China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam on this list, primarily because liquidity tends to build up in these countries without the ability to seamlessly use this liquidity outside these countries – in other words, ‘trapped cash’,” he says.</p>
<p>Of course, regulation is not the only challenge. “The most obvious obstacles are differing regulations, restrictions and currencies,” says Shankar. “However, we’ve noticed that over the years the more significant obstacles are the softer issues, such as ensuring that teams across countries collaborate to adhere to a higher degree of centralisation without losing flexibility.”</p>
<h4 id="evolution-and-liberalisation">Evolution and liberalisation</h4>
<p>The region’s disparate regulatory climate may prove challenging, but it is also something of a moving target – with changes in regulation presenting both challenges and opportunities. Venkat cites the example of the People’s Bank of China allowing limited cross-border sweeps in CNY and USD in some cases. But he also notes that “the pace of evolution has been slow,” meaning that restrictions are likely to continue in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>ANZ’s Sarup says that little has changed in terms of lifting the caps and controls on cross-border flows, which he notes is the main deterrent to the optimal use of liquidity. “However, we have seen some tactical evolution – for example just recently, China’s SAFE introduced new guidance and regulation with respect to cross-border cash management programmes,” he says.</p>
<p>And market liberalisation is not limited to China, as HSBC’s Wong points out. “Thailand continues to promote itself as one of the biggest international centres in Asia by hosting international businesses and allowing fund flow currencies to move in and out of Thailand (excluding Thai baht),” he says, adding that “Hong Kong and Singapore are engaged in healthy competition for the spot of top regional treasury centre in Asia.”</p>
<h4 id="interest-rate-challenges">Interest rate challenges</h4>
<p>Interest rates are another significant factor when it comes to effective liquidity management. Wong says that while rates have increased over the last two years, “now we are likely to see them plateau.”</p>
<p>He also notes that some countries are beginning to ease up interest rates based on inflation, with New Zealand, Malaysia and the Philippines all recently cutting rates by 25 basis points. “For treasurers, this means that the focus will shift from yield to efficiency, with the focus on making the collective cash more efficient,” he says. “This is thus an opportune time to start looking at business expansion while cash deposits are at a high level.”</p>
<p>ANZ’s Sarup argues that changes in interest rates “are a good test and proof point of the strength of a liquidity management model.” He adds that the journey of a treasury model from decentralised to centralised to in-house bank “should ideally sustain interest rate change – whether these occur in local or benchmark rates.”</p>
<h4 id="choosing-the-right-structure">Choosing the right structure</h4>
<p>Against this backdrop, choosing the right liquidity management structure can be challenging – and the complexity of the region means that different companies will need different approaches.</p>
<p>As BofAML’s Venkat says, “It is important for treasurers to look for solutions that provide them with the flexibility to automate a wide variety of structures.” He says that these may include physical sweeps in single currency, multi-bank and multi-currency cross-border sweeps, and “more complex multi-currency notional pooling and pricing enhancement programmes across multiple legal entities.”</p>
<p>And of course, the approaches favoured by corporate treasurers may vary in line with evolving market conditions. HSBC’s Wong says the bank has partaken in many discussions on yield enhancement over the last 12 months, “with average return a key performance indicator.” Meanwhile, clients are asking whether it is worth staggering their deposits and looking at their forecasts more closely. Wong observes, “The only way treasurers can get a better yield and optimisation of interest positions is to have clarity of when spend and receivables are coming in and how they can strategically deploy cash.”</p>
<p>Shankar, meanwhile, says that there is no one-size-fits-all approach – and that organisations need a combination of solutions to address areas such as visibility, sweeping, notional pooling and interest optimisation in order to reduce borrowing costs and enhance yield. “We are seeing an increasing number of corporates preferring TMS platforms to have full visibility of cash flow forecasting rather than liquidity only,” he says.</p>
<p>He also notes that with the rise of retail marketplace and tech businesses, there is a greater need for integrated cash management and FX settlement platforms that can link the entire ecosystem of suppliers, platform owners and end consumers.</p>
<h4 id="harnessing-technology">Harnessing technology</h4>
<p>The latest developments in technology have much to offer across the full range of treasury activities – and liquidity management is no exception.</p>
<p>As Wong explains, “Technology has played a large role in giving information to treasurers, and showing how we can make data into information that can provide valuable insights.” He adds that HSBC offers a variety of products that can help treasurers achieve optimal efficiency in cash, “including Liquidity Investment Solutions which enable our clients to maintain daily liquidity for transactional purposes, while automatically investing their surplus cash on a daily, weekly or monthly basis.”</p>
<h4 id="determining-future-liquidity-positions">Determining future liquidity positions</h4>
<p>Shankar says there is “increasing demand from treasurers for tools that provide the ability to determine their cash flow and liquidity position at any given point in time” – a task that Shankar says can be done by identifying key data points that help anticipate incoming and outgoing deposits from supply chain systems and working with technology providers to obtain meaningful results. “You look at the sales pipeline and how long it takes to generate a receivable – and, eventually, for that receivable on balance to turn into cash,” he explains. “By using historical data to establish behaviours, you can start to predict your liquidity position.”</p>
<p>That’s not to say achieving this is straightforward. Mark Evans, Managing Director, Transaction Banking, ANZ Institutional, says that with data often held in legacy systems, it can be difficult for treasurers to extract the data or draw insights that can determine cash flow and the company’s future liquidity position. And the challenge can be even greater when cash is held across multiple countries and banks.</p>
<p>However, technology can help. “Today, technology allows you to aggregate and analyse the available data into meaningful insights by looking at existing and historic trends,” says Evans. He notes that treasurers need to start considering technology that can enable mapping of these data points and support them in making better-informed decisions “using dashboards and predictive analytics.”</p>
<h4 id="leveraging-ai">Leveraging AI</h4>
<p>Finally, where cutting edge technology is concerned, BofAML’s Venkat says that treasurers “can look to their banking partners to leverage innovative technology solutions such as AI and robotics to forecast future customer flows based on past trends.” He also notes that multi-currency virtual account solutions can enable treasurers to “significantly rationalise the number of physical accounts that they need to maintain globally.”</p>
<p>As Venkat explains, treasurers can leverage these technology innovations to derive operational efficiencies and achieve “a truly global liquidity management structure which can be automated and customised to their unique requirements, and meet their key priorities of visibility, control and returns.”</p>

<h5 class="title">VP &amp; Head of Treasury, Thomas Cook (India) Limited</h5>
<p><img alt="Thomas Cook (India) Limited logo" class="logo org" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/logo/thomas-cook-travel-smooth-logo-2017-120x58.png?la=en&amp;hash=C6CEA98588F68792CD816999E809916D" style="margin-top:1.5em;" title="Thomas Cook (India) Limited logo" width="120"/></p>


<h5>Could you give us an overview of your liquidity management strategy?</h5>
<p>Our long-standing approach towards conserving cash, minimising dependence on external borrowings, and creating enough liquidity backups has paid off well.</p>
<p>We have chosen to stay away from borrowings as far as possible by focusing on efficiencies. Over the last five or six years, we have been going aggressive on maximising financial efficiency within the entire system, in line with our parent company Fairfax’s philosophy of Free Cash Flow (FCF) – one of the key criteria that Fairfax uses to measure performance of its group companies.</p>
<p>Our strategy includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Efficiency improvement and free cash maximisation has enabled Thomas Cook (India) Limited to go almost debt free in 2018. We dip into the credit lines only occasionally due to temporary cash flow mismatches. Barring these exceptions, we continue to have a decent amount of surplus cash on the balance sheet, which fetches us some good returns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From a liquidity risk management perspective, we have been working on creating liquidity backups, not only in the form of cash reservoirs (invested in liquid schemes or bank deposits) but also in the form of undrawn bank lines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the group companies, the strong position of the parent – ie Thomas Cook (India) Limited – acts as a backup support system. We have also been able to get credit lines at a group level, which are available to many of our group companies, as well as setting up unsecured credit lines for group companies across multiple geographies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We are also working on cash pooling alternatives in various parts of the globe to improve financial efficiency, and we have initiated work with a few overseas subsidiaries on tracking currency movements, tracking exposures (if any), and providing hedging support.</p>
<h5>What are your main goals where liquidity management is concerned?</h5>
<p>Our key goals include creating liquidity backup for all debts at a group level, keeping external borrowings to a bare minimum, and having internal funding mechanisms in place as an alternative to external borrowings – both through structured and unstructured mechanisms.</p>
<p>Other goals include efficiency improvements which have a favourable impact on the working capital cycle, and giving visibility to management on our overall liquidity position using dashboards.</p>
<h5>How do you see technology and innovation supporting liquidity management?</h5>
<p>We are going aggressive on getting technological support. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Expediting the realisation of monies/collections and tracking the same. This is done by using payment gateways to accept monies via multiple modes of payment, and using the Unified Payment Interface (UPI) mode of collections, including both ‘push’ and ‘pull’ mechanisms. We have virtual accounts for B2B collections and are working on operationalising the less widely used virtual accounts for B2C businesses. We also have Amex Business Travel Account (BTA) and Mastercard/Visa Central Travel Account (CTA) mechanisms in place, through which monies are collected and directly paid to airlines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are using initiatives for payments like plastic (as well as virtual) credit cards, and an automated platform for the financing of domestic supplier payments to get financial efficiencies in place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We also have nostro accounts in place akin to those used by banks. For overseas payments through our nostro accounts, we have a multi-currency tool provided by Bank of America which enables us to make cross-currency payments in more than 100 currencies. We were highly commended in the Best SWIFT Solution category in Treasury Today Asia’s 2017 Adam Smith Awards Asia for this.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>From trade-related risks to regulatory change, the current market has many challenges from an investment point of view. How can treasurers in Asia structure their liquidity portfolios in such a way that they can maximise resiliency and achieve the flexibility needed to react to changing circumstances?</em></p>
<p>For corporate investors, achieving portfolio resilience is particularly important in the current market, given the challenges and risks currently shaping the region’s investment landscape. But what does portfolio resilience really look like – and how can treasurers achieve it?</p>
<h4 id="challenges-and-risks-in-the-current-market">Challenges and risks in the current market</h4>
<p>The current market certainly has plenty of challenges, risks and pressures for treasurers to consider. Venkat ES, Head of Asia Treasury Product, Global Transaction Services at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofAML), says that treasurers currently have to consider two key factors when looking to manage liquidity in Asia.</p>
<p>“For one thing, ever since the US dollar rate started rising, we have seen local central banks trying to reduce interest rates on local currencies to offset any major capital outflow and manage their own monetary position,” he says, noting that treasurers in Asia face challenges in moving cash out of some countries with stricter regulatory frameworks. Nevertheless, many treasurers are seeking to take advantage of rising interest rates in more liberal markets, while some are looking to repatriate cash in order to take advantage of tax reforms in the US.</p>
<p>The second factor Venkat cites is the constant search for yield optimisation – a particular challenge when treasurers need to hold negative yielding currencies, like Japanese yen, in order to meet day-to-day operational and liquidity management needs. “Treasurers are constantly asking banks if there are any structures or strategies that will help them work on this challenge,” he says.</p>
<h4 id="uncertainty-abounds">Uncertainty abounds</h4>
<p>At the same time, treasurers are also keeping tabs on developing trade-related risks. In December, for example, China’s exports fell by 4.4% compared to the previous year – the biggest drop in two years. Meanwhile, China’s trade surplus with the US widened to US$323.32bn, stoking fears of further developments in the ongoing trade war.</p>
<p>These issues have a knock-on effect for other countries in the region. In March, Taiwan’s exports contracted for the fifth consecutive month alongside weakening demand from China. Singapore and Hong Kong likewise stand to lose out as a result as the US-China trade war continues to affect exports.</p>
<p>Aidan Shevlin, Head of Asia Pacific Liquidity Fund Management at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, points out that concern about economic, trading and geopolitical uncertainty are “feeding into investor and business confidence – that’s where we see people worried about portfolio resiliency.” Alongside these factors, other regional considerations include debt levels in China, as well as FX volatility and interest rate volatility.</p>
<p>So far this year, Shevlin notes that Chinese markets have been broadly stable, to an extent, “because the government has been proactive in trying to stabilise them.” He says that the current focus on economic stability has included fiscal measures such as tax cuts and increased spending on infrastructure investment, as well as interest rate cuts by the PBOC. These measures may have reduced the likelihood that portfolio resiliency will be tested – but nevertheless, Shevlin notes that achieving resiliency is still an important goal for companies in the region.</p>
<h4 id="the-need-for-resilience">The need for resilience</h4>
<p>“In my mind, resilience is incredibly important,” says Anton Abraham, Head of International Advisory, Global Transaction Services at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. He emphasises that treasurers should – and do – focus closely on their ability to respond to changing circumstances, from market turbulence to M&amp;A opportunities. “The question is, how do you structure your liquidity portfolio in such a way that you have the flexibility to respond to these events?”</p>
<p>As such, he argues that effective cash flow forecasting is a prerequisite for portfolio resilience. “That might mean doing some stress testing, running models and understanding seasonal variances,” he says. “Once the organisation’s future liquidity requirements are well understood, it is much easier for the treasurer to diversify instruments across different investment classes, risks and levels of liquidity.”</p>
<p>What does resilience look like in practice? At its most basic level, corporates need security and access to liquidity – and to achieve this, investors should diversify and invest in a range of assets. “So even if you are dealing in the highest quality assets, you shouldn’t put all your eggs in one basket,” explains Shevlin. “You shouldn’t just buy all of one type of bond, in case of a specific event relating to that bond, or a specific type of volatility within the market which makes it very difficult to liquidate that bond.”</p>
<p>Actions that may help to achieve a resilient portfolio include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Diversifying investments.</strong> By diversifying across issuers and instrument types, companies can minimise the likelihood of a disruption relating to a specific issuer or asset class. Companies may also seek to diversify across the maturity spectrum in order to achieve a range of different maturities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Due diligence.</strong> When it comes to achieving resilience, Shevlin emphasises the importance of carrying out sufficient due diligence on the investments a company is investing into. “For direct investments, do you understand the counterparty risks you are facing on these? If you are buying a fund, are you comfortable with both the fund itself and with the fund manager? Have they got the experience and ability you are looking for – and are they prepared to explain their investment philosophy and underlying investments? Asking these questions beforehand, and being satisfied with the answers, is a very important step in making sure your investments are resilient during times of stress.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Being prepared for regulatory change.</strong> Also key to achieving resilience is the need to protect the company from regulatory changes, particularly in large markets like China and India. Again, stress testing and scenario planning can be a valuable tool in managing these risks. “Several years back, regulations changed and companies weren’t able to move liquidity out of China cross-border to include in regional or global cash pools,” recalls Abraham. “Treasurers who had planned for this scenario – and modelled what the impact might be for their investments or general banking facilities – were in a better position.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Segmenting cash.</strong> Achieving portfolio resilience isn’t just a question of making suitable investment choices – treasurers also need to make sure mechanisms are in place to identify which funds are available for investment, and at which tenor. Venkat notes that treasurers typically distinguish between their operating surplus and investment surplus. The former includes cash needed for day-to-day liquidity needs, as well as cash earmarked for obligations such as tax payments or loan repayments that can be invested at a longer tenor. For the investment surplus, meanwhile, Venkat says that where feasible, companies typically pull funds into a tax-friendly location with better yield opportunities.</p>

<h4 id="investment-strategies-and-instruments">Investment strategies and instruments</h4>
<p>Of course, there is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to choosing an investment strategy. “The strategy will absolutely depend on the nature of the organisation and the industry they operate in,” says BofAML’s Abraham. “For example, a commodity trading company will have a very different strategy versus a car manufacturer.” He also points out that different companies’ view of risk can vary considerably – and that companies in the same industry may have very different risk appetites.</p>
<p>Risk appetite is a major factor in determining individual companies’ investment strategies. Adhitya Wisesa, Director, Head of Institutional Liquidity Management APAC Global Coverage Group of DWS, says that investors who are concerned about rising risk in financial markets may consider decreasing their allocation to higher-risk assets such as stocks, and increasing their allocation to lower-risk assets such as cash.</p>
<p>“Money market mutual funds represent a popular cash option for investors, particularly corporates,” Wisesa adds. “Such funds typically provide higher yields than bank deposits by investing in highly liquid short-term debt securities that have minimal credit risk.” He comments that in today’s interest rate environment, money market funds have been becoming a more attractive investment option relative to current account positions that earn little to no interest.</p>
<p>In practice, most treasuries stick with bank deposits, money market funds and, in some cases, government securities, adds David Blair, an independent treasury consultant based in Singapore. “Anything else is rare outside of large cash-rich tech companies, which generally outsource such investment anyway,” he notes.</p>
<h4 id="seeking-yield">Seeking yield</h4>
<p>J.P. Morgan Asset Management’s Shevlin says that while he hasn’t seen a significant change in terms of the instruments used by companies, higher yields in the US are helping to “drag yields around the world higher” in markets including Hong Kong and Singapore – and this is giving companies more opportunities to invest cash effectively.</p>
<p>Where time deposits are concerned, Shevlin points out that banks are trying to come up with new structures to help adjust for Basel III. “Banks much prefer to have deposits which are longer term in nature, so if investors can dissect their money into short-term and long-term buckets, they can take advantage of the longer-term instruments that banks are now offering,” he says.</p>
<p>With greater opportunities for yield, companies have more incentive to consider placing cash that is not immediately needed further out the maturity curve – thereby giving up liquidity, and potentially taking more credit risk, in return for a higher return. Consequently, Shevlin says that treasurers should not just focus on short-term time deposits and money market funds, “but invest across the spectrum in terms of different levels of credit risk, different maturities and different levels of liquidity.”</p>
<h4 id="investment-policy">Investment policy</h4>
<p>A robust investment policy is a crucial tool when it comes to achieving portfolio resiliency, but not all companies have a policy in place. Shevlin says that an investment policy should be broad and wide enough in scope to cover a lot of eventualities. “If it’s too narrow in focus and too detailed, it may curtail your ability to do things which could improve your flexibility,” he comments. “It’s also important to make sure the policy is suitable for the markets you are operating in.”</p>
<p>Companies based in the US or Europe may have a policy which is closely tuned to conditions in their home market – but when those companies move into Asian markets, they may find the policy is no longer a good fit for the market composition and the instruments available. For example, the policy may stipulate that the company can only invest in a money market fund that is over a certain size in order to avoid representing too great a percentage of the fund’s total investments. While this may be a prudent decision in a market such as the US, younger markets may have a limited number of funds available that are large enough to qualify. Likewise, stipulating that investments must be AAA-rated may be an effective strategy in some markets, but impractical in others.</p>
<p>Investment policies therefore need to be a good fit for the market the company is operating in – and they also need to be adjusted as market conditions evolve. Developments such as regulatory change and rising interest rates may prompt a review to check whether the company’s investment policy is still suitable – in Europe and the US, for example, recent money market fund reform would mean that an investment policy stipulating constant net asset value funds would no longer be fit for purpose.</p>
<p>Changes to the company may also prompt an investment policy review. BofAML’s Abraham says that while companies do not typically review their policies more often than every 18-24 months, events such as M&amp;A activity, a significant change in the organisation or the appointment of a new CFO could prompt a review. “In such cases companies may take the opportunity to make sure the policy is still aligned with the business strategy,” he says.</p>
<p>In order to avoid frequent updates, it may be advantageous to build a more flexible policy which is able to accommodate certain developments. “Rather than focusing on whether a fund has to be stable net asset value or variable net asset value, you should be thinking more holistically about what the risk level is, how much risk tolerance you want in the fund, how much liquidity you are looking for and how much security you need,” says Shevlin. “These are the things you would want to think about, rather than specifying numbers or allocations in a way that makes the policy less flexible over time.”</p>


<h2 class="h3 copy__heading">Money market funds in China</h2>
<p>China’s money market fund industry may be relatively young – but the market has grown rapidly in the last 15 years. It also has the world’s largest money market fund in its Yu’E Bao platform, which is run by Alibaba Group’s Ant Financial Services Group. While Yu’E Bao’s assets under management had reached over RMB1.7trn by the end of March 2018, the size of the fund had shrunk to RMB1.13trn by the end of the year amid pressure from Chinese regulators and concerns about liquidity risk and systemic instability. That said, the fund attracted 114 million new investors in 2018 – and in March, the Wall Street Journal reported in March that over a third of China’s population was invested in the fund.</p>
<p>China may not have gone as far as replicating the types of money market fund reforms introduced in the US in 2016, and in Europe last year. Nevertheless, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has introduced new rules to keep the burgeoning money market fund industry in check. These included limiting instant redemptions from a single money market fund to RMB10,000 per day.</p>
<p>Much of the growth of China’s money market fund industry has been driven by retail investors – but as Shevlin notes, retail and institutional investors may differ somewhat in terms of their approach and their priorities. “Institutional investors’ tolerance of risk is different than retail investors,” he explains. “Retail investors typically focus on looking for the highest yield, whereas an institutional investor’s key priorities are liquidity and security. The priority for them is to have a safe product.”</p>
<p>Shevlin predicts that regulatory reform will lead to greater interest from institutional investors in the next couple of years. “China’s regulators are quite forward looking and have tightened the regulations a number of times over the last few years,” he says. “We have seen Chinese regulations for money market funds move closer to Western standards over the last few years – but there’s still a gap, and in that gap there’s an opportunity for AAA-rated funds which have tighter guidelines and are more in line with international standards.”</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>Cash pooling is an established optimisation tool for multinationals looking to effectively manage liquidity, streamline bank account structures and lower bank transaction and, despite periodic bouts of concerns about its relevance, its future remains bright.</em></p>
<p>Regulatory change and the rise of new technology have led to question marks over cash pooling in recent years yet it remains an effective, valuable strategy for companies aiming to maximise the availability of internal sources of capital, especially when it is executed on a global scale.</p>
<p>There are two main types of pooling: physical cash pooling – also referred to as sweeping or zero balancing – and notional pooling. Cash pooling brings together a number of individual bank accounts to pool balances, optimise interest and improve an organisation’s liquidity management. And it can be executed across multiple jurisdictions, currencies and entities, depending on the type of cash pool in place.</p>
<p>Galia Elizondo, Global Product Manager, Cash Management at Finastra says companies looking to execute either physical or notional pooling first need to understand the types of liquidity management techniques available as well as the tax, regulatory and commercial issues that may come into play during pooling operations in different countries.</p>
<p>She explains physical cash pooling can be achieved on both a single-country and cross-border basis, using one bank or multibank, with the most common method for sweeping being where balances are physically moved in one currency at a time. In practice each company division or subsidiary maintains its own bank accounts – effectively sub-accounts of the header account. Assuming there is no regulatory restriction, these accounts can be held in location. At the close of each business day, all the balances from the accounts held in the subsidiary accounts are swept to the header account and this header account (which may or may not have an agreed overdraft for the use of the group of accounts) will send over the deficit balances.</p>
<p>Usually the main account is maintained in the name of another legal entity, such as the parent, a regional subsidiary, or a finance company – whatever best suits from both a practical and tax perspective.</p>
<p>Elizondo says: “The first thing to note about cash pooling is that nothing has really changed with the practice over the years. It remains what it always was, a way for companies to physically concentrate balances on a number of accounts into a single header account, in order to optimise interest and also invest the surplus concentrated in this header account.”</p>
<p>The other main type of pooling is notional pooling. This is primarily a tool for interest enhancement. Notional pooling structures are typically overlay structures. Debit and credit balances on a series of accounts owned by the same or different entities and domiciled in the same country are notionally netted for interest calculation purposes, without a physical movement of cash. Multicurrency notional pooling offers the ability to achieve a net notional position in a single currency without the need to perform traditional FX or swaps, and extends the benefit of further interest savings as a result of compensating balances in different currencies.</p>
<p>In addition to the two main types, hybrid solutions which combine notional and physical pooling are available for optimising liquidity. Elizondo says in her experience with multinationals, most first physically sweep balances from local accounts into a local master account (an account per currency). After centralising individual countries, the accounts are then centralised to a global structure and balances then notionally pooled, with cross-currency notional pooling a typical solution here.</p>
<p>In recent years there has been speculation over the relevance of notional pooling due to regulatory changes, for instance Basel III, making corporates perhaps unsure whether it will be useful to them in the future. But Elizondo assures that “notional pooling is very much alive and will continue to be on the agenda in the future for corporates wanting to optimise cash management”. “In fact, I think notional pooling will actually be more popular going forwards. It’s actually gaining in popularity now for cross-currency notional pooling in one country. That is particularly true here in the UK where we have so many currencies flowing through and, as a result, we see a lot of corporates want a multicurrency notional pooling scheme,” says Elizondo.</p>
<h4 id="lets-get-physical">Let’s get physical</h4>
<p>So, what are the pros and cons of physical cash and notional pooling? The concentration of all of a company’s surplus cash into one account, generally managed by the group treasury, will certainly help improve its control over cash. If the net balance of the cash pool is positive, this aggregated balance can be used to invest in overnight or short-term deposits, such as money funds and other short-term products. Companies with large treasuries often have dedicated staff managing these investments, with treasury accounts also likely to get better interest rates.</p>
<p>The establishment of a physical cash pool enables treasuries to exercise greater control over cash flows. Ideally all subsidiaries should participate in the cash pool, as this provides the centre with more information about the daily cash flows that exist throughout the company. Establishing a physical cash pool also means that the treasurer need only negotiate one credit limit for the entire group, thus avoiding the need for separate credit arrangements to be set up for each subsidiary participating in the cash pool.</p>
<p>In this type of arrangement, the treasury has a high level of visibility over the balances of subsidiaries’ accounts and, as a result, can control the distribution of cash. A subsidiary experiencing cash shortfalls can be funded from the master account at a cheaper rate than could be arranged locally. The treasury should be able to reduce borrowing costs significantly by using balance aggregation to arrange inter-company funding.</p>
<p>Disadvantages associated with the physical movement of cash between accounts include the creation of a series of inter-company loans between the master and participant accounts. This can have complex implications, particularly with regard to, for instance, withholding tax and, in some countries, ‘thin capitalisation’ rules which restrict the level of financing a subsidiary can receive from its parent or major shareholder.</p>
<p>The transfer of funds between a company’s subsidiaries can also create legal issues due to the co-mingling of funds, while the physical transfer of cash between accounts will incur high banking costs, particularly if a large number of movements takes place and/or cross-border transfers are involved.</p>
<p>Also, most cash pooling arrangements require that all participant accounts are held with the same bank. This may cause problems for companies with operations in many countries – a bank which is strong in one country may offer a more limited service, or indeed no service, in another.</p>
<p>Variations on vanilla physical cash pooling include target balancing whereby cash sweeps are arranged so that accounts in the pool are left with a pre-determined target balance after the sweep. Different target balances can be set for the constituent accounts in the pool. It is even possible for the treasurer to set negative target balances – an overdraft facility – on some of the participant accounts.</p>
<h4 id="lets-get-notional">Let’s get notional</h4>
<p>With notional pooling the main benefits include subsidiaries maintaining their autonomy over their bank accounts and retaining their cash balances as no physical concentration of cash occurs. The group however achieves similar economic benefits as it would with a physical cash pool.</p>
<p>Notional pooling also means less administration as balances remain with each legal entity and no inter-company loans are created – notional pooling requires far less administration than physical pooling. Notional pooling incurs lower fees than physical pooling as the bank operating the pool is not required to transfer cash between accounts.</p>
<p>The drawback with notional pooling is that the balance sheet of both the bank and the company involved in a notional pool can become unnecessarily large. This is because there are no physical cash transfers occurring between the various accounts in the cash pool. Specifically, a bank offering notional pooling services may find that it is unable to offset fully the debit and credit balances appearing on its balance sheet. This will affect the way in which the bank allocates capital, which will in turn affect the interest compensation paid to the pool.</p>
<p>Also, in some countries notional pooling is prohibited and the way in which net interest is calculated can vary from country to country. Furthermore, separate overdraft facilities and credit agreements will need to be negotiated for each account participating in the cash pool. This can make managing liquidity across a company more complex.</p>
<p>Variations of notional pooling include interest optimisation, a limited form of notional pooling whereby a bank offers a company preferential credit and debit rates – that is, it returns to the company some of the ‘turn’ it would normally benefit from. This service is usually offered in jurisdictions where full notional pooling is not permitted.</p>
<p>More broadly, there is the overlay cash pool, which isn’t necessarily distinct from notional, conventional target or zero balancing but can contain components of all three. It is a cash management service that facilitates the aggregation of liquidity from a series of multiple underlying banks or accounts into a single bank or banking structure. This could be within a single bank, but typically an overlay structure refers to a multi-bank structure.</p>
<p>Where balances are held at two different banks, the cash has to physically move from the local bank to the overlay bank. This can be done by the corporate instructing its local bank to push the funds to the overlay bank – where every day at a particular time the bank pushes excess cash into the overlay bank account structure. The alternative is for the overlay bank to pull the cash from the local bank at a predefined time and within certain parameters.</p>
<h4 id="horses-for-courses">Horses for courses</h4>
<p>The key difference between the two main types of pooling is that notional is favoured by companies that want their subsidiaries to maintain their autonomy, while physical pooling enables budgetary assistance to be actioned across subsidiaries with surpluses being invested in a money market fund or a short-term financial product – the transfer of funds results in a transparent or clean pooling structure.</p>
<p>Elizondo says that one thing notional pooling allows that is very advantageous is that no intercompany loans are generated and cross border transfers are not necessary. However, one major disadvantage of notional pooling schemes is that they generate the need for cross guarantees, cross indemnity agreements or pledge guarantees. This is because the bank requires each participant to indemnify the bank, or provide a guarantee to like effect, against any other participant’s default. That means there is much more documentation generated and it needs experts to basically read all the documentation and small print that banks will give to the corporates.</p>
<p>She adds: “Any legal entity that wants to participate in a notional pool must give the bank the right to offset the pooled debit and credit balances and record the net position only on its balance sheet. Usually the participating subsidiaries sign a cross guarantee agreement. This cross-guarantee agreement implies that in case of default, the risk should be borne by the credit account balance legal entities of the notional pooling account structure, and it will be equivalent to the sum of debit account balances in the structure.”</p>
<p>Based on her many years of experience in pooling – she spent several years at Banco Santander as a global liquidity manager with a focus on sweeping and pooling before joining Finastra – Elizondo reckons around 75% of corporations favour physical pooling. Of the rest around 15% implement notional pooling and 10% will plump for a hybrid solution.</p>
<p>It is vital companies consider country specific regulations when considering notional and physical pooling. In general, notional pooling tends to be implemented more in Asia and in Europe, which is also the most mature region globally for hybrid solutions. Physical pooling tends to find favour in Latin America and the US. She cautions that in some countries, like China and India, which do not allow unrestricted cross border movement of funds, pooling solutions are very difficult to implement, with the cost of doing so likely to outweigh the benefits.</p>
<h4 id="optional-routes">Optional routes</h4>
<p>Jelle Goossens, Head of Group Treasury at Barry Callebaut Group, Singapore, says that aside from pooling structures involving third-party (usually banking) partners, corporates can also look to in-source these activities by deploying an inhouse bank ledger-based solution. “Inter-company flows related to commercial, lending, and hedging activities can be settled completely virtually in a transparent and cost-effective manner. Moreover, if executed within the same ERP platform, this will help to create efficiencies by avoiding inter-company reconciliation differences; a job which can become quite cumbersome in companies that have a global footprint and global supply chain, resulting in a matrix of possibilities of inter-company relationships,” he says.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Goossens says, in a more advanced set-up, one could implement daily inter-company swaps of cash/debt positions in currencies different from the home currency of the operational entity. The FX swaps serve to align the mismatch between the cash flows – for example the underlying commercial risk as hedged item versus the hedging instrument which, when best-practice, is also an inter-company hedge traded with the inhouse bank – mitigating the risk of changing interest rate differentials. As a result, the operational entity shows a clean net cash or debt position at the end of the day, resulting in a clear-cut financial expense or income.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, all of these virtual flows and associated financial risks are centralised, create transparency and hence allow risk management within a single financial vehicle. Granted, as with external pooling structures, such virtualisation also faces challenges including regulatory, compliance and fiscal and across emerging Asia they are especially pronounced. However, the efficiency gains should not be underestimated.”</p>
<p>Goossens says such integration within a group-wide ERP system can be a key enabler when it comes down to forecasting cash flows, which in turn drives more efficient and effective liquidity management. “In the third-party bank linked solutions, forecasting is done based on what could be labelled as first-order derivative pieces of historical information, such as cash collections and payments, which are extrapolated to forecast the future.</p>
<p>“However, especially for corporates in the B2B-space, access to the underlying sources of the cash flows – commercial contracts, purchase orders, sales orders and ultimately invoices – provides insight in what to expect well in advance – before the bank statement indicates what cash flow took place.”</p>

<p>It is treasury’s responsibility to obsess about liquidity and to ensure that stakeholders from across the business understand why effective cash forecasting is so crucial to the financial sustainability of the company. However, a finance team’s efforts can sometimes be disproportionately skewed toward profit planning at the expense of cash forecasting.</p>
<p>To help redress the balance, and hopefully improve the quality of the forecast, it may help to focus on the following:</p>
<p>Obtain leadership buy-in. The support of the Finance Director is a must. Success lies in ensuring that sufficient resource and attention is dedicated to cash planning and forecasting.</p>
<p>Benchmarking a firm’s liquidity provision against industry peers and stress testing annual forecasts at their cyclical ebb are useful techniques to help quantify the exposure. Hopefully it will show how well positioned your firm is, but if not, this type of simple analysis can help bring to life the liquidity risk that exists so it can be mitigated.</p>
<p>Actively engage with internal stakeholders. If the teams that you depend on for information don’t appreciate why accurate cash forecasting is so important, they will inevitably de-prioritise it in favour of activities they think will add greater value. Proactive engagement with teams that feed into the forecast process is therefore critical.</p>
<p>A brief discussion at a functional team meeting can help de-mystify the world of treasury and provides an opportunity to evangelise the importance of effective liquidity risk management.</p>
<p>Find an enthusiastic analyst. Most finance teams are brimming with talented analysts, eager to immerse themselves in an interesting change project. Some tips that might support them in this endeavour are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Source at least two years’ worth of daily cash flow data and ‘clean’ it to remove any one-off events (such as disposal proceeds or national events) that might skew the underlying data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify any predictable events (for example payroll, tax, VAT or rent) and remove them from the data set until you are left with a cash profile that is essentially a trading cash flow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obtain the latest budget/plan and overlay the monthly cash flow figures into the model so it produces a phased daily forecast by month – adding back known periodic or unique events on the appropriate dates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use your judgement to sense-check outcomes and listen to your analysts – they will doubtless have some great ideas that will enhance the quality and presentation of the forecast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With this baseline long-term forecast you can add payment data from your ERP system to create a more accurate near-term view.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Track actual daily performance against the model and continually refine.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>To ensure that a business can actively manage its liquidity risk, you need good data which requires support from across the business. If internal stakeholders appreciate the consequences of getting it wrong (bankruptcy!) and understand how valuable their contribution is, they will want to help you get it right and things will improve.</p>

<p>Forecasting is part art, part science, part human intelligence, part machine intelligence. While forecasting is done differently across industries, in all cases, treasury first must understand the sources of data and how they impact corporate operations, and then apply technology to make meaning of the data.</p>
<p>Relevant information used for forecasting can be found within the siloes of an organisation and beyond the enterprise, creating complexity, limiting data sharing, and resulting in inefficient data gathering processes. Costly searches and manual sorting lead to data integrity problems, which compound as organisations expand and acquire businesses locally and globally.</p>
<p>Once sources of data are understood, the next step is to centralise and normalise the data into a single source of truth. This can be accomplished through imports/exports from many source applications to an open, cloud-based TMS platform, using APIs and robotics to automate this process seamlessly, without human intervention. System-to-system communication eliminates human errors, and by removing manual information gathering, teams have the time and the analytical power to perform strategically, rather than operationally. This is beneficial especially as market conditions change.</p>
<p>When data is centralised, it must be flexible enough to manipulate. By default, treasury reverts to using Excel because users can quickly change the data. However, spreadsheets do not allow management to audit or identify trends, and they only provide static views for manual comparison. While management wants to give their teams autonomy to amend data as their business changes, they must still be able to measure changes in forecasts and monitor patterns dynamically. Treasury systems today automate this process, and if they are SaaS-based, they allow everyone to work consistently off the same application, regardless of where they are globally.</p>
<p>After treasury has extracted relevant data, centralised it on a common treasury management platform, and has been able to amend, analyse and archive different versions of forecasts, the TMS can perform the heavy lifting. Treasury management systems should be able to apply sophisticated simulations to predict financial viability over time using historical events. Advanced calculations, AI and machine learning is the science behind the art of accurate and efficient forecasting. Treasury management systems that can identify data patterns can bring organisations one step closer to predicting the future. Once implemented, statistical analytics become any organisation’s true competitive advantage.</p>

<p>For more than a decade, liquidity and forecasting have remained in the top three challenges for CFOs and treasurers globally. This begs the question: why has this been a perennial challenge for so long? The reason: treasury operations today are, for the most part, a series of unintegrated systems, spreadsheets and silos between groups and other departments.</p>
<p>Companies are often faced with multiple ERPs, many entities, and different currencies. These make the task of managing liquidity a major challenge, not to mention a significant manual effort involving many people. The result: lots of time spent gathering and validating data while still not having a full, transparent view into the numbers. The volume, variety, velocity and veracity of data generated each day has made traditional analysis – using spreadsheets, for example – obsolete. It is just not possible to manually aggregate and analyse that much data with sufficient speed to be able to gain insight, and then turn that insight into action.</p>
<h4 id="what-should-a-treasurer-or-cfo-be-asking-themselves">What should a treasurer or CFO be asking themselves?</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Can you identify all your sources of data that you need to make a cash flow forecast? Eg ERP (how many do you have, are they all on the same instance), CRM, bank statements, trend analysis, manual data (such as budgets).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How often do you refresh your short-term/mid-term cash forecast? (Daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or I don’t make a cash forecast).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do you ensure no mistakes happen in your data capturing/consolidation?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do you incentivise your subsidiaries? Local subsidiaries and users typically download information from their ERP, and upload in other types of files to HQ, or in SharePoint, or they will just send Excel files from all over the globe to HQ, which means it’s 100% manual. There’s no real alignment of the processes across subsidiaries and no audit trail at the local level.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-to-consider">What to consider?</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Companies should ensure their information is system-based. In other words, they have full integration with their ERP, so they don’t have to manually download data (it should flow automatically).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any augmentation of data should have an audit trail so that, ultimately, the group treasurer can see who did what, and when they did it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automate the process and deploy alert functionality, such as reminders for subsidiaries to post their local forecast, and for the group treasurer to look for it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure bank connectivity to enable comparison of actuals with forecast figures.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="i-have-the-data-now-what">I have the data. Now what?</h4>
<p>With this data, treasurers should now be able to answer these four key questions: what happened; why did it happen; what will happen; and what should be done?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Descriptive analytics answers the question, “what happened?” This is the most basic form of big data analytics, and provides a picture of past events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diagnostic analytics, “why did it happen?” Diagnostic analytics enables you to perform root cause analysis and use that information to prevent future repetition of events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Predictive analytics, “what will happen?” Predictive analytics uses advanced algorithms – often with artificial intelligence and machine learning – to forecast future events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prescriptive analytics, “what should I do?” Prescriptive analytics tells you what the best steps are to achieve a specific result. Prescriptive analytics requires advanced machine learning capabilities.</p>
</li>
</ul>


<h2 class="h3 copy__heading">Next question:</h2>
<p>“How much of a practical issue will it be for treasurers if LIBOR rates are replaced?”</p>

<p style="clear:both;">NTUC Income (Income) is an insurance cooperative in Singapore, established in 1970 as a National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) social enterprise providing affordable insurance for workers. Today, Income is the top composite insurer in Singapore and one of the country’s largest general insurers and health insurance providers, serving over two million customers.</p>


<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<h2 id="problem">Problem…</h2>
<p>As an insurance company, Income receives premiums in the form of cash and invests them in private and public assets, as stipulated in its strategic asset allocation. “Given our size and stature, we have an enormous responsibility to efficiently generate long-term, sustainable returns to meet policyholders’ and shareholders’ reasonable expectations,” said Philip Pang, Head of Investment at Income.</p>
<p>Income is committed to meeting those expectations by diversifying its sources of return, actively managing its assets and harvesting the illiquidity premium embedded in its long duration assets and illiquid holdings. The insurer recognised that efficiency and optimal returns on the liquid, short end of the spectrum were critical as well.</p>
<p>Cash management was traditionally the responsibility of Income’s internal portfolio management team. In early 2018, the firm appointed a new investment manager to manage a significant portfolio of its assets. To ensure continuity in managing the assets by both sides, relevant Income portfolio management personnel, including cash managers, joined the external investment management company. Income also appointed a new custodian in mid-2018.</p>
<p>As part of the change, a wider reassessment of its portfolio and cash management processes was performed, where Income executives made several critical changes. “As a result of appointing a new investment manager, we felt that a holistic look at our cash management process was warranted so as to yield both operational efficiencies and improved returns,” said Pang.</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="solved" style="text-align:right;">…Solved</h2>
<p>When it comes to enhancing the efficiency of cash management, Income worked with the custodian and potential cash solutions providers in the market. In this regard, the firm reviewed portfolio managers, compared track records, credit and investment processes, commitment, client service and more. The process led to what Income regards as a viable solution: an auto-sweep into JPMorgan SGD and USD Liquidity Strategies via the custodian. This highly liquid overnight cash parking solution offered diversification into high-grade counterparties as well as a potential yield pickup over cash.</p>
<p>Throughout the adoption process, the J.P. Morgan Global Liquidity team worked closely with Income’s investment team to ensure a thorough due diligence process was completed and that they fully understood and were comfortable with the investment strategy and risk management process.</p>
<p>“Our due diligence efforts paid off: the auto-sweep facility, with the JPMorgan Liquidity Strategies at its core, is a solution that checks the boxes for us,” said Koon Wei Goh, Manager, Asset Allocation at NTUC Income.</p>
<h4 id="key-benefits">Key benefits</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Operational ease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Same-day liquidity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhanced diversification, credit quality evaluation and risk control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A potential yield pickup over cash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Timely investment holding reports to meet regulatory requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>“In our view, all that adds up to less risk, greater reward and better value for our policyholders and shareholders,” said Goh.</p>

<p><img alt="BNP Paribas logo" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/logos/bnp-paribas-logo-2019-160x33.png?w=130&amp;la=en&amp;hash=EEAB330CF9E8605259E2EA1B0238EF9E" style="width: 130px;" width="130"/></p>
<p style="clear:both;">In 2018, US corporate cash positions fell by around 10%. Tax reforms and the subsequent re-evaluation of offshore cash, boosted shareholder activity (in the form of dividend increases and circa US$1.1trn of planned share buybacks). It also increased paying-down of corporate debt and saw a surge in CapEx and M&amp;A spend.</p>
<p>Although 2019 shows signs of cash holdings rising and deployment levels stabilising, many treasurers are still working with lower overall cash reserve and excess positions. There is continued pressure to sustain healthy levels of onshore cash and cash equivalents as they continue to meet the liquidity demands and capital deployment opportunities of their organisations.</p>
<p>As they do so, prudent treasurers should be seeking clarity over how their banks are dealing with the cash management implications of geopolitical events such as Brexit. Treasurers must also remain attuned to the extra compliance and reporting pressures imposed on business operations by the rapidly evolving financial regulatory environment.</p>
<p>In light of these dynamics, treasurers should be evaluating the most judicious models of managing their cash. Three key questions arise:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is the yield on our cash sufficient?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How quickly can our cash be deployed?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What investment products meet our policy and comfort levels?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="yield-and-access">Yield and access</h4>
<p>Any decision to re-model will be driven by the prevailing corporate philosophy on safety, yield and liquidity. But rising yields in 2018 have seen treasurers become more active in their cash investment approach. Indeed, higher-return products are back on the agenda although not at the expense of accessibility, which remains paramount.</p>
<p>Re-modelling cash investments thus requires liquidity management discipline. An organisation-specific cash profile and dividing cash into segments according to need, can bring clarity. Typical segments are: operational (sub-30 days); reserve (one to six months); and strategic (six months-plus).</p>
<p>Each segment will inform a different investment solution. Operating cash may be best served by interest-bearing accounts, short-term deposits or government money market funds, all creating an essential ‘liquidity cushion’. From here, and in all cases dependent upon policy approval, reserve cash may be invested in products such as longer-dated time deposits, structured deposits (with bonus yield for non-withdrawal) or repos (higher yield when posting certain collateral).</p>
<p>Strategic cash may suit a separately managed account (SMA). These leverage a professional manager who will seek to further enhance yield through a portfolio of high-quality corporate and government securities. SMAs demand comfort with the asset manager’s investment approach but, within the fee, treasurers could expect regular professional investment management dialogue, access to credit analysts, and possibly some flexibility around cash withdrawals.</p>
<p>In the current environment, treasurers taking a more active approach to cash investments could generate some beneficial outcomes. When even a simple revamp of investment policy can harvest a 45 basis-point pick up on yield, it’s a discussion worth having.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>Liquidity management is a fundamental concern for treasurers around the world – and putting in place a suitable structure is essential in order to achieve the required level of visibility and control over cash. The effectiveness of such structures can be affected by everything from M&amp;A activity to regulatory change. Treasurers should regularly review the structures they have in place to ensure the company’s needs are met – but what does a best in class liquidity structure look like, and how can treasurers achieve this?</em></p>
<p>The scope of the treasurer’s role can vary considerably from company to company. But for all treasurers, knowing where the company’s cash is being held, and making the best use of that cash, is a fundamental concern – as indicated by surveys which consistently place cash and liquidity management at the top of the treasurer’s priority list.</p>
<p>In order to manage liquidity effectively, treasurers can draw upon a wide range of tools and techniques, from physical sweeping and notional pooling structures to centralised payment structures such as payment factories and in-house banks. But while these tools can help companies achieve goals such as reducing the cost of funding and maximising interest income, the effectiveness of liquidity management practices is also affected by considerably market conditions.</p>
<p>In the last few years, the liquidity landscape has changed considerably – and conditions are continuing to evolve. “Anyone answering the question of what has changed in liquidity management over the last year in early June would have been forgiven for assuming that 2016 typified another year of the “new normal” for corporate treasurers, with the general low rate environment continuing and only some slow shoots of recovery on the horizon,” comments Yera Hagopian, Head of Liquidity Services, Barclays Corporate Banking. “Subsequent political and market shocks have marked the start of a new phase, one that is far more volatile and less predictable even than the preceding period.”</p>
<p>Hagopian also points out that Europe and the US may be heading in very different directions where interest rates policy is concerned, with broader currency and economic implications. “In this environment, even seemingly conservative investment strategies can carry market risk that can damage underlying business performance.”</p>
<p>In this challenging market, it is more important than ever for companies to review their existing liquidity management structures and make sure that the processes in place continue to be a good fit for the company’s needs. This includes having a thorough understanding of the company’s specific requirements – and of the considerations that should be addressed in order to achieve a best in class liquidity solution.</p>
<h3 id="why-review-your-liquidity-structure">Why review your liquidity structure?</h3>
<p>Liquidity management structures are not set in stone. Companies should periodically review their structures to make sure they continue to suit the needs of the organisation, and that they continue to provide the expected benefits. Such a review might include questioning whether a different structure is needed, but could also include asking whether funds should be swept to a header account more or less frequently than they currently are.</p>
<p>“We work very closely with clients, and continuously review their structures with them to make sure they are operating efficiently,” says Suzanne Janse van Rensburg, Head of Liquidity, GTS EMEA at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “As companies change and evolve, so too should the liquidity structure.”</p>
<p>In addition to regular reviews, a number of internal and external factors may prompt treasurers to review their existing structures. “Internal changes such as introduction of a payments factory can make more decentralised solutions redundant, giving rise to opportunities for stripping layers out of structures,” says Hagopian. She notes that a change in interest rates can also be a driver – as can a change in business profile which leads to a funding requirement where previously there was a surplus.</p>
<p>The introduction of new technology may also trigger a review. “The deployment of a new treasury management or ERP system will inevitably necessitate a review of end-to-end liquidity management practices to drive workflow and cost efficiencies,” says Conor Maher, Head of Cash and Liquidity, Product and Capital Management, NatWest. “These may include daily cash management routines, the type of bank reporting and payment interfaces, and a general curiosity to benchmark against the practices of other corporates.”</p>
<p>Other developments which could trigger a review include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Changes in the tax or regulatory environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Geopolitical events, such as Brexit or changes to global trade agreements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>M&amp;A activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The introduction of internal structures such as a payments factory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changes to the company’s funding requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changes to the company’s legal entity structure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="impact-of-regulatory-change">Impact of regulatory change</h3>
<p>As noted above, regulatory changes can act as a catalyst for reviewing current practices. “There are of course periodic seismic shifts that require a major review,” says Hagopian. “Changes to regulations governing US Money Market Funds in 2016 can be described as such a change. This has led to many corporates reviewing their investment policies, resulting in changes to their portfolios or changes to their operations to deal with a VNAV (variable net asset value) world.”</p>
<p>Hagopian points out that the focus on liquidity risk that Basel III brought to banks’ treasury risk framework is also now starting to take effect. “Although arguably the impact for corporates is secondary, many are now finding that their bank’s appetite for liquidity, especially of the non-operational kind, is limited,” she explains. “Negative rates in some currencies have only aggravated the problem. In order to preserve capacity, careful consideration is required regarding wallet allocation and maintaining close banking relationships with key providers of balance sheet capacity. This has always been true for debt provision but now extends to deposits.”</p>
<p>Where Basel III is concerned, Hagopian says that more nuanced impacts include the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and the benefits to a bank’s balance sheet of obtaining deposits with contractual maturity of greater than 30 days. “Many corporates have investment policies that heavily restrict use of instruments with greater than 30-day maturity, but increasingly corporates are reviewing these policies to see if cash can be tranched and internal processes improved to give greater certainty of when cash will be required,” she says. “Some businesses are of course better placed to do this depending on the nature of their clients and contracts.”</p>
<p>Hagopian notes that the regulation may also have unexpected consequences for liquidity management structures. “Notional pooling is one such area,” she says. “The requirement to report on a gross basis for leverage means that notional pooling can have a material capital footprint, even though by risk weighted measures, the same structure would have a minimal capital footprint. That does not make notional pooling unworkable in all circumstances but it does mean that structures requiring particularly large gross limits may become uneconomic to operate or future flexibility to support business growth is lacking.”</p>
<p>Hagopian points out that like overnight deposits, notional pooling structures are much loved by corporates because they provide low maintenance and flexibility. However, “the new regulatory environment puts a price on these features and therefore forces a proper evaluation.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Janse van Rensburg says that while companies may be reviewing the use of certain structures, such as notional pooling, she has not yet seen any companies stop using them due to regulatory considerations, albeit she has seen companies move providers. “We haven’t had any clients specifically request a change in location of the header accounts,” she says. “We have had one client which moved away from a notional pool to a physical pool – but that was due to the treasurer’s preference, rather than being driven by regulatory change.”</p>


<h2 class="h3 copy__heading">Section 385</h2>
<p>While regulations such as Basel III have certain implications for liquidity management structures, some other areas of regulation have proved to have less of an impact than first anticipated. In the US, Section 385 of the Internal Revenue Code became a concern when proposed guidelines were published in April 2016.</p>
<p>The rules, which will require companies to recharacterise related party debt transactions as equity in certain situations, initially looked set to cover structures such as cash pooling. However, this was addressed later in the year with the publication of the final and temporary regulations, which included exemptions for this type of structure.</p>



<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<h3 id="best-in-class">Best in class</h3>
<p>What does a best in class structure look like? While the optimal liquidity structure may mean different things to different people, there are a number of considerations which treasurers should bear in mind when determining which structure is best suited to the company’s needs.</p>
<p>According to Maher, “The more obvious attributes include real-time visibility and same-day access to a corporate’s cash regardless of where it is domiciled within a multi-bank or multi-jurisdictional structure coupled with timely and accurate bank statement reporting for reconciliation purposes.</p>
<p>“Equally important, but much more difficult to achieve, is timely and accurate enterprise-wide cash forecasting capability – specifically the ability of the organisation to accurately predict periodic cash positioning (whether daily, weekly, etc), driven by a robust understanding and coordination of collections due from customers and disbursements to its suppliers.”</p>
<p>Maher notes that the larger the company, the more difficult – and indeed essential – it is to build “cultural and workflow arrangements that promote dynamic and accurate cash forecasting to avoid the opportunity cost of idle cash balances in bank accounts.”</p>
<h4 id="no-one-size-fits-all">No ‘one size fits all’</h4>
<p>Above all, it is important to choose a structure that is suited to the company’s needs and the treasury’s capabilities. “Some people try to over-egg the complexity of what they do in this area,” says David Stebbings, Director, Head of Treasury Advisory at PwC. “Companies need to achieve a balance between what they need, their ability to manage and the associated costs. There’s no point setting up automated pooling structures if your flows are such you are only going to pool cash once a month – visibility will suffice in this instance. And remember, automated pooling is never a substitute a for good quality cash forecasting.”</p>
<p>It is also important to note that there is no one structure that is inherently better than another – the important thing is to adopt a structure that suits the specific needs of the company.</p>
<p>“There is no ‘one size fits all’,” says Janse van Rensburg. “A structure that is best in class to one company may not be suitable for another company. For a smaller or medium sized corporation, the priority may simply be to achieve visibility and control. A complex multinational may already have these elements in place, but may need a more complex solution such as a global or regional hybrid structure with a combination of physical and notional pools.”</p>
<h4 id="local-considerations">Local considerations</h4>
<p>The chosen structure will also depend on opportunities and limitations in the relevant countries. Jason Marsden, Head of Client Solutions – TPS International, Standard Bank says that the treasurers of large multinationals in Africa are looking to implement regional treasury centres similar to the structures operating across more mature markets.</p>
<p>“Whereas this is possible in a number of markets, regulations in most markets will only facilitate an effective domestic liquidity management structure,” he explains. “This is also limited in many instances to physical cash concentration or sweeping. However, there are clients who are starting to pilot shared service capabilities in some instances.”</p>
<h4 id="the-bigger-picture">The bigger picture</h4>
<p>In addition, it is important to make sure that any structure is a good fit not only for a company’s immediate liquidity needs, but also for its wider business strategy.</p>
<p>“We’ve really changed the focus in terms of how we communicate with clients,” says Janse van Rensburg. “When we are designing a liquidity management solution for a client, we are not just looking at a siloed approach – we are getting into the nitty gritty with the client, working through the end-to-end working capital management cycle and downstream impacts, and then building a solution based on the broader picture to make sure it ticks all the boxes for the client.”</p>
<h3 id="harnessing-technology">Harnessing technology</h3>
<p>While technology certainly plays a part in supporting effective liquidity management, adopting the latest technology may not be a top priority for all companies.</p>
<p>“We always assume that most treasurers are at the ‘bleeding edge’ of technology,” says Marsden. “And yet a large number of clients are still requesting assistance in dealing with some of the basic treasury and liquidity management requirements, including having a clear, real time view in terms of the liquidity position in the various markets around Africa.”</p>
<p>Janse van Rensburg notes that while a lot of banks have focused on offerings such as automated investment sweeps and active investment linked to ebanking platforms, in reality “there hasn’t been a huge amount of take-up of those products”.</p>



<blockquote><p>This virtual world will impact the time taken to open accounts, improving implementation times, reducing costs and physical paper flow, allowing for more electronic authentication of both people and payment processes across the globe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source">Suzanne Janse van Rensburg, Head of Liquidity, GTS EMEA, Bank of America Merrill Lynch</p>


<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Nevertheless, she says that technological advances are bringing new concepts to the table with developments such as the use of virtual currencies and consolidated KYC and AML. “This virtual world will impact the time taken to open accounts, improving implementation times, reducing costs and physical paper flow, allowing for more electronic authentication of both people and payment processes across the globe.”</p>
<p>Technology can also support liquidity management in other ways. Hagopian says that banks are realising the power of the content they capture through the card and payments data flowing through their systems. “Creating Operational Data Stores capable of containing millions of data lines, and providing this back as meaningful cash-flow analysis, can help illuminate win-win scenarios for clients looking for investment efficiencies and banks looking to preserve capital,” she explains. “It’s at the margin, but with low base rates here for a while at least, technology can help bring about change to liquidity management.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hagopian notes that with treasurers hard pressed to increase yield in the current markets, there is an increasing trend for platform type aggregators, whereby corporates can consider multiple ‘bids’ simultaneously. “Where banks can respond and offer differentiation is the technology wrapper that brings their offering to clients, conveying a broad spectrum of services and solutions to clients through a unified channel,” she adds.</p>
<h3 id="building-a-structure">Building a structure</h3>
<p>Finally, it is important to be aware that setting up a liquidity management structure is not without its obstacles. Stebbings points out that one of the biggest hurdles can be the fact that a cash pooling structure may take cash and banking autonomy away from local businesses, which local CFOs may resist.</p>
<p>“Having a strategy that says, ‘This is where I want to get to and this is why I’m going to get there’ is key,” he says. “It’s also important not to over extend yourself – companies should aim to be realistic. This might mean identifying that if the company is in say ten countries, six of which are key, the treasurer might automatically pool the six key countries in the first instance, and manually pool the remaining countries in order to see if it’s worth automating them in the longer term.”</p>
<p>Maher agrees that treasurers need to be clear on their objectives. “Systems investment may be required, so is a business case needed or is the driver more about visibility and control?” he says. “What about any tax consequences (eg withholding tax, changing the location where interest income is generated through pooling, etc)? What are the alternatives for ‘trapped cash’? Finally, bank charges are also relevant when determining reporting frequency and same-day cross-border movements to ensure ongoing liquidity management costs are proportionate.</p>
<p>Stebbings adds that treasurers should be careful not to underestimate the difficulties involved in putting in a new liquidity structure, both from a cost and resourcing point of view. “It’s not a two week project to put in a decent liquidity structure,” he concludes. “It’s important to get the business case right, be focused about what you’re doing and get the right support from your banks, internal IT and legal, and if required external consultants. This is common sense, but can sometimes be forgotten.”</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>When in December 2015 the US Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates by 25 basis points – the first rise in nearly a decade – it not only ended near-zero borrowing costs but also signalled that the world’s largest economy had at last turned a corner. The impact of that action was felt far and wide as equity markets quickly rose across Europe and Asia and USD strengthened against a basket of major and minor currencies.</p>
<p>The US central bank’s tightening of monetary policy also heralded a small change for the better for some investors as the two-year Treasury yield pushed past 1% for the first time since 2010. With only gradual increases indicated by US policymakers from now on, caution is the watchword: the Fed said in a statement that it would “carefully monitor actual and expected progress” towards its 2% inflation goal.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, the European Central Bank (ECB) maintained its accommodative course with Mario Draghi taking time in late January to staunchly defend the central bank’s aggressive monetary easing policy. Eurozone borrowing costs have dropped by 80 basis points since the launch in 2014 of the ECB’s quantitative easing (QE) package. The programme has now been extended until March 2017.</p>
<h3 id="taking-the-wider-view">Taking the wider view</h3>
<p>With two of the largest central banks on an opposing interest rate trajectory, divergence of monetary policy, with far-reaching consequences on both sides, it seems, is the new normal. This is the first time in a long time where we are seeing divergence in major central bank policy rates across the world, notes Amit Agarwal, EMEA Head of Liquidity Management Services, Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS), Citi. Divergence, he comments, is a symptom of different levels of economic growth: the US is on an upward stroke whereas Europe is exhibiting growing pains and the China-led Asian emerging markets are slowing.</p>
<p>Of course, it is not just USD and euro that are affected, observes James Lee, EMEA Sales Head, Technology, Media &amp; Telecoms, TTS, Citi. In Europe, the ECB’s stance has been mirrored by other currencies with Swiss franc (CHF), Danish krone (DKK) and Swedish krone (SEK) even going negative. Following the Fed’s rate rise, other central banks in LatAm and in parts of Africa also opted for interest rate rises. Clearly, treasurers must broaden the outlook of their currency and associated interest rate exposures.</p>
<p>With the expectation that the Fed will continue to tighten policy and the ECB to remain accommodative, divergence will only increase on the wider scale. But there are other elements to consider too. With Basel III and CRD IV, for example, the different jurisdictional interpretations of key regulations are creating additional challenges for bank and non-bank organisations alike. There is potential for conflict too between the as-yet undecided path of the EU regarding MMF reforms versus the already resolved US approach which will be implemented in October 2016. For investors the world over, this state of affairs demands attention.</p>
<h3 id="the-right-approach">The right approach?</h3>
<p>“Treasurers have always reviewed their investment policies on a regular basis. But this has caused them to take a look at those policies from the ground up,” says Lee. Security of principle and liquidity remain primary concerns but whilst investment return is of secondary importance, in the current environment certain considerations must be attended to in order to ensure optimisation. Indeed, there is an arbitrage opportunity here, notes Lee. With USD offering a better return, companies using low, zero or negative rated currencies are seemingly at a disadvantage. But borrowing in a low rate environment and investing at a higher rate is a simple opportunity.</p>
<p>To ensure this is the right approach, treasurers need to consider their pool of currencies and if they are associated with USD they may consider leaving them in-country to get better rates of return, Lee explains. “Many corporates look to maximise liquidity and bring cash into the centre for maximum control and to enable them to invest it in the most economical way possible. But maybe they need to leave some currencies in the local market to minimise the cost of negative interest rates.”</p>
<p>Consideration ought to be given to dividend policy too, says Lee. Where a negative interest rate currency is held, it may be beneficial to dividend up to another company in the group, translating that cash into another currency to mitigate the cost of managing negative interest rates in that jurisdiction. The efficacy of this would depend on local rules around withholding tax. However, these may pale into insignificance as the corporate taxation agenda prepares to take a major new direction as the OECD’s reforming Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project comes to fruition.</p>
<p>Where companies artificially shift profits to low or no-tax locations where there is little or no economic activity, the level of corporation tax being paid is minimised. BEPS, supported by many governments around the world, aims to modernise international tax rules by revising the OECD’s existing Model Tax Convention and Transfer Pricing Guidelines. It is anticipated that these revisions will be completed and released by 2017. Before that, warns Agarwal, there will not only need to be a wholesale review of how treasury centres are managed and where they are located, but also how companies approach investments where their cash ends up in different locations and currencies.</p>
<p>With a full strategic review of investment policy advisable in order to extract the most value, Agarwal urges treasurers also to consider any such revision from a risk management perspective, paying particular attention to translation risk. On the one hand, putting a lot of liquidity into some of the emerging market currencies – Turkish lira (TRY) or Russian ruble (RUB), for example – may yield satisfying results as interest rates in those markets are at a very high level. But some emerging markets have seen devaluations of between 40% and 60% in recent months.</p>
<p>“Companies have to be mindful of their investment policy but also be conscious of their supply chains in terms of where cash is being generated and in which currencies they have appropriate currency translation risk hedges in place,” comments Agarwal. There may be natural hedges available if producing and selling in the same market, but in a global interconnected economy, the supply chains of the companies often tend to have buying and selling patterns in certain currencies. It is here, he notes, that substantial exposures are created which in the current environment “need to be seen in a holistic manner”.</p>
<h3 id="taking-action">Taking action</h3>
<p>In terms of translating this understanding into investment activity, a firm grip on exposures is the essential starting point, says Agarwal. Major corporates and MNCs operating in almost every part of the world will have exposures to most currencies albeit by varying degrees. These companies may have good visibility of their cash across 80% of their market, these tending to reflect the most stable part of their portfolio. But in a volatile and divergent environment, he argues that robust forecasting strategies must come to the fore “so that even before they start building an investment portfolio, they know where their cash is, in which currencies, and where their exposures are”.</p>
<p>There has been a notable shift in the last few years that has seen increasing numbers of corporates opting for a more sophisticated in-house bank model, notes Lee. A key part of this structure is the visibility and control of cash that it brings. Control can come through automation of sweeps from local accounts into centralised locations, minimising or zero-balancing cash locally. Visibility comes from investment in various core systems (such as an ERP or TMS) but also in the deployment of bank proprietary solutions which not only deliver visibility but also assist with forecasting, allowing treasurers to manage their investments “in a much more structured and sophisticated way” and providing a more accurate line of sight for short-, medium- and long-term liquidity needs.</p>
<p>The combination of a stressed global economy, divergent monetary policies and the leveraging of technology has seen a partial shift by some corporate investors away from traditional investments tentatively towards those that might yield a greater return whilst upholding their policies of security of principle. Tri-party repos in particular have seen an uptick in interest (in both senses of the word) and banks such as Citi have responded to market conditions with the introduction of new products such as the 31-day, 60-day and 90-day term deposit options, which allow its clients to invest more strategically and potentially mitigate negative interest rates.</p>
<h3 id="stay-alert">Stay alert</h3>
<p>In the long run, keeping a close eye on the Fed and ECB is essential as their actions have far-reaching consequences. But Lee urges treasurers to pay heed to broader political themes. With the spectre of ‘Brexit’ (the UK’s possible departure from the EU) for example looming over the markets, the likely fallout of such an event will spread, potentially with significant bearing on the investment space.</p>
<p>In preparing the ground for control and visibility over cash and investments, Agarwal advises treasurers to use resources that are close to the action – including the banks – as the move towards reshaping investment portfolios gathers pace. Maximising returns whilst maintaining liquidity and security is a tough ask in today’s divergent economic environment. However, Agarwal believes that banks’ own balance sheet needs, their interpretation of regulatory reform and the pace of monetary policy change should be sufficient motivation for all parties to discuss strategic investment options and portfolio mix in terms of the right products, currencies, tenor and even geography.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>

<p>The integration of four existing bonded zones in the Pudong district into the single Shanghai Free Trade Zone (SFTZ) has always been seen as a sign of China’s commitment to reform. With the intention of simplifying the way that business is conducted within China, SFTZ is indeed a bold and progressive move. The reforms launched through SFTZ, while paced, have largely followed the original blueprint, and the mere fact that reforming measures are alive and well should be celebrated. So, some 18 months after its launch, it is worth asking what difference does SFTZ really make to a company’s treasury practices and its business in China?</p>
<p>“It is the most significant event in China’s financial history over the past decade, simply because it is seen as the test-bed for liberalisation of policies that could be rolled-out nationwide,” explains Sandip Patil, Citi’s Regional Head of Global Liquidity Management Services. He says that, as a pilot scheme, it is necessary to assign SFTZ “very significant importance”. When it was launched, he says it had a strong driving force largely to prepare China for the challenges of liberalised trade, to promote the currency and to further open up the economy. It has since been catering to the internationalisation of China’s trade effort, taking a journey towards major change such as initiating interest-rate liberalisation – before certain parts of the experiment went nationwide last year.</p>
<p>In February 2015, ‘third wave’ guidelines were issued by PBoC, opening up new financial channels for SFTZ-based entities (see the March/April 2015 edition of Treasury Today Asia for detail on the first two waves). These ‘upgraded’ the existing approval and quota system for companies borrowing RMB and foreign exchange outside of China. The changes afford corporates (and non-bank financial institutions) operating in SFTZ a lot more flexibility when structuring their foreign debt profiles – as indeed they do for the hived-off foreign trade accounting units (so-called FTUs) of Shanghai-based banks for all client business booked in the Zone.</p>
<h3 id="specialist-zones">Specialist zones</h3>
<p>Considering the changes implemented to date, there were several public observations made last year questioning the value of SFTZ, notes Patil. “Our view remains that it is a very fruitful and meaningful experiment. The deregulation coming up is proving the point that it is just increasing in scope; slowly but surely China is committing itself to further deregulation of its economy, especially around capital markets and capital accounting forms.” He believes that the progress seen so far has been impressive. The first major evolution is the SFTZ itself; the second is the SFTZ expanding to broader horizons within Pudong District (the original 28 sq km area is now almost four times the size) facilitating three more physical locations – for high-tech, manufacturing and financial services – creating specialised hubs within SFTZ. The third major manifestation of progress will be the expansion of ‘free trade’ to three more zones, namely Guangdong, Fujian and Tianjin. The suggestion is that it will afford more freedom for foreign-funded firms to retain their foreign exchange capital without converting into yuan. It is anticipated that each new district will also operate along specialist lines. “We expect formal confirmation in the near future,” says Patil. Although no specific timeline has been set, he comments that it is all “clearly progressing in a very positive direction, giving a greater amount of financial liberalisation power to the entities operating in the free trade zone.” Progress, he concludes, “is very satisfactory”.</p>
<p>As a test-bed for the wider liberalisation of the Chinese economy, with planned geographic expansion, it is absolutely achieving what it was set up to, confirms Patil. As one of the first banks to set up in SFTZ, Citi’s view is that there has been good adoption rate by its client-base, with billions of financial flows in and out – both core objectives. To contextualise this flow, he points out that at this time last year there were around 3,000 registered entities in SFTZ; today there are more like 16,000. “It clearly shows more and more entities are interested in establishing themselves in SFTZ and more are doing cross-border business. It is achieving its objectives – and a lot more is to come.”</p>
<h3 id="broader-reach">Broader reach</h3>
<p>By looking at the benefits seen by the multinational corporate segment when effecting cross-border trade, tangible results can be demonstrated. Cross-border pooling has increased as more of MNCs are engaged in borrowing and lending RMB. Trapped cash has been an issue for many such businesses and, says Patil, “many clients are now able to deploy that cash in business operations outside of China”. Experimentation around lowering onshore funding costs for Chinese businesses is also heading “in a positive direction”. Newer concepts such as in-house banking, ‘on behalf of’ payments and collections, and netting have similarly risen up the agenda of MNCs seeking greater efficiencies as SFTZ delivers on its initial promise. “Since the pilot scope was expanded, it has given increased power to many more customers who are benefitting from some of these concepts by implementing them nationwide – within a controlled mechanism.” This, Patil feels, should give the regulatory authorities the confidence to take the entire experiment fully nationwide. Indeed, he says, giving those companies in SFTZ many more tools to function more efficiently and now facilitating the opening of an FTU, takes the free trade zone concept “to the next level”.</p>
<p>No project of such monumental importance is going to be delivered without first experiencing some challenges. The first of these challenges is for MNCs to connect funding with their onshore businesses, to support all of their needs; the ability, for example, to bring offshore money to fund working capital is limited by the amount that can be borrowed. The second is around China’s capital account; this is an experiment in that direction too, it is not yet fully liberalised. As such, it is cheaper to fund outside of China, however, the new rules announced in February materially increased the previous limit on the amount of offshore funds a company in SFTZ can raise, which is now limited to twice its capital. In comparing SFTZ with more financially liberal spaces such as Singapore or London it is clear that SFTZ still requires the clarity and definition in terms of legal and taxation structures. “But it’s likely to progress in that direction as FTU/FTZ adoption grows in size and scope,” comments Patil.</p>
<h3 id="reaching-further">Reaching further</h3>
<p>It is also likely, given the steady progress to date, that there will be further benefits as PBoC increases the scope of reform and expands the number of FTZs. For Patil, the FTU concept has been a major recent enhancer of opportunity and driver of demand, vastly improving treasury and working capital cycles: “if your objective is to borrow or lend more offshore, across local or foreign currency, you can”. Being part of an FTU in SFTZ also means being able to access FX markets onshore and offshore. “It’s the best of both worlds,” he comments. “A company can execute all its FX onshore with CNY (Chinese yuan) and all the associated needs it might have around these transactions. It can also gain access to the CNH market (the Chinese offshore yuan).”</p>
<p>Clearly, market expectation is rising with each new announcement, and the conversation is heading towards bringing the capital markets and the different types of financial instrument onshore. There are calls, too, for further liberalisation of China’s capital account. Patil is anticipating a positive outcome, not least, he says, because such issues are now being discussed in the market. “It is difficult to predict when this will happen and in what form we will see these changes, but we do expect further reform.”</p>
<h3 id="a-roll-for-both">A roll for both</h3>
<p>Despite the advantages of SFTZ, it is still an experiment, says Patil, and as such it is unlikely to satisfy all onshore business requirements. Operating an onshore or nationwide treasury is therefore “a must” to support a major business; companies will continue to run these units simply because they have to and “SFTZ just happens to be an experiment in their journey”. As far as domestic business is concerned, Patil believes that the role of onshore treasury is not going to change materially in the short run. And when specifically referring to some of the liquidity tools and techniques currently available in China, certainly more freedom in terms of onshore location is now possible. The ability to pool RMB regionally or globally, for example, means there is no circumstance where a business is ‘geographically’ forced to set up an entity in SFTZ. However, by the same token, this is the time for clients to finalise the roadmap of globalised treasury and execute against that in phases.</p>
<p>So how important is the role of a global bank? Citi is a tier one institution with a global footprint. It therefore has clients to match. It has also been in China for over 100 years and has created a local client base and a depth of capabilities and talent that goes with such longevity. This, says Patil, enables it to keep in touch with the regulators and maintain a position that helps it shape the most appropriate response to global market needs. As vice-chair of the Shanghai Banking Association, a working committee amongst banks in Shanghai, we are able to add value to our clients by providing insights from the industry to the regulator, he says. “We also play an advisory role for our clients; this is a material benefit in terms of informing them of regulatory change.” In talking to, listening to and advising all parties over the years, Patil says a bank with the status of Citi can effectively communicate and demystify the changes across its network, facilitating client feedback “to help the regulators take the experiment to the next level.”</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p><em>Inefficient mobilisation of liquidity has a number of negative effects on corporate financial well-being, not least being increased risk. The good news for businesses is that there are several ways to hold a steady course in a rolling ocean of market uncertainty.</em></p>
<p>In an economic environment beset by market volatility and low returns, global treasury operations are faced with a daunting task when it comes to optimising liquidity. Just trying to hold on to company cash when there are so many scenarios that are seemingly set on disrupting the peace may make the role of the treasurer feel a lot like sailing into the wind. For some, a downturn in orders from customers conspires with later payment receipts to threaten working capital stability. Even where sales orders have picked up in the wake of the financial crisis, the volatility of the markets and the all-time low yields experienced by most organisations continue to emphasise the ‘normal’ risks associated with the mobilisation of cash to create what for many must feel like waves of disruption.</p>
<p>Liquidity risk, credit risk, country risk, (even continent risk), currency risk, counterparty risk, tax risk and operational and compliance risk are all threats to the peaceable use of company funds in such circumstances. If it is considered then that many multinational businesses lack full transparency and visibility over their cash structures, the level of exposure to these risks in the current economic environment presents a threat that must not be ignored.</p>
<h3 id="drivers-for-change">Drivers for change</h3>
<p>Such uncertainty has served to push cash and liquidity management up the agenda to the point where they have become board-level issues, says Dennis Carey, Solution Consultant for cloud technology vendor, Reval. Where the concern is with idle cash (a “significant, unproductive asset”), the feeling, he notes, is that if the company doesn’t do something with that cash, “then someone else certainly will.” Indeed, a vast pool of idle cash can make a business a target for a takeover – will shareholders resist a buyer with plans to work that cash hard? But cash pools may be positive if used wisely.</p>
<p>They can, for example, be a means of unlocking working capital. Instead of borrowing in one location, it may be possible to use the cash from one group operation to help fund another. Tackling the effective mobilisation of liquidity also facilitates more effective risk management. This could be from a counterparty risk perspective, ensuring not all eggs are in one basket, or from a foreign exchange risk management view where having a lot of cash in a particular currency exposes a business to fluctuations in that currency. “The idea of having cash where it is needed and not have it sitting idly by is very important,” states Carey.</p>
<p>Effective cash mobilisation is both a need and an opportunity, agrees Søren Kyhl, Global Head of Transaction Banking at Danske Bank. As the role of the corporate treasurer has become more strategic, so the need has risen to devote more resources to ensuring liquidity is in place at the right time, he says. But he acknowledges that this action faces difficulties in a low growth, low interest-rate environment where the competition in almost all industries is focused more intensely on cost. “Corporate treasurers are having to do more with less and this is driving the need to optimise processes and make sure they don’t have cash lying around,” he notes. “They need at all times to make use of all available opportunities.” The good news, he adds, is that there are “many more opportunities now,” aided by technology and even regulation (SEPA, he suggests is good example of the latter).</p>
<h3 id="determining-the-right-solution">Determining the right solution</h3>
<p>“The first step to solving a problem is to admit you have one,” notes Carey. In the current environment, and with treasury under pressure to perform, this may be more readily admitted. However, the most appropriate solution very much depends on the specific situation. A programme of optimisation will need to consider in which countries the business is present, the currencies it is exposed to, its tax structure, the banks it uses and the various legal and regulatory points that may apply in (and perhaps between) each jurisdiction. In short, there is no one-size-fits-all solution.</p>
<p>Determining the most appropriate structure is thus a matter of asking the right questions, says Carey. This will start internally with tax, legal and operations functions, aiming to identify the challenges and pitfalls. And then, he says, it is a matter of working with banking partners “to get a consensus view” by taking a number of individual bank views and pinpointing the common themes.</p>
<p>Treasury consultants also have a key role to play in this process, especially tax and audit partners who possess the level of local expertise that may be beyond normal corporate understanding of areas such as thin capitalisation and transfer pricing. Regulatory matters will also arise, including exchange controls between currencies, central bank reporting requirements and bank capital testing. Of the latter, due to new capital adequacy rules in various jurisdictions, Carey explains that services like notional pooling may no longer make business sense for the banks.</p>
<p>The discovery process can be “a very cumbersome task,” says Kyhl. Talking to his clients, he can see that many are constrained on resources – not just budget but IT too – and are under pressure to keep costs down. He sees them re-assessing the efficiency of cash mobilisation on two fronts: “It will be the same issues and constraints that need to be investigated so we try to pull this together and advise on how to minimise costs on interest and working capital but also on how to streamline and save costs on internal processes and operations.”</p>
<h3 id="internal-and-external-solutions">Internal and external solutions</h3>
<p>Internally managed solutions range from an inter-company loans structure to a simpler means of enabling entities to identify and report their cash needs and excesses, and having a process in place to move group cash to where it is most needed. Corporates can also work with their banks to set up more formal physical or notional pooling structures, multi-lateral netting or virtual accounts (the latter currently for collections only). “A significant concern with cash is the number of inflows and outflows between affiliates,” says Carey. “Having a structured process in place to clear inter-company payables and receivables will move cash to where it belongs; having an affiliate with a lot of cash and that is not paying their inter-company requirements is a concern.”</p>
<p>More sophisticated formal structures include in-house banking. These started, and remain most prevalent, in Europe – but they are now gaining traction in other areas, particularly Asia Pacific. Although bank involvement remains necessary, a corporate treasury centre is used to manage operations from one place. More recently, these structures have seen the addition of a layer on top known as ‘payments on behalf of’ (POBO) or ‘collections on behalf of’ (COBO). This places the in-house bank as the corporate’s counterparty to its own external obligations. When in-house banking first started, each affiliate would pay its own bills and funnel the cash to the treasury centre. Now we are seeing the treasury centre paying the bills, so the cash never needs to move down to the affiliates.</p>
<h3 id="know-your-cash">Know your cash</h3>
<p>The dynamic nature of all these variables indicates that successful mobilisation of cash is an ongoing and long-term project. However, the first and most fundamental task is to be able to identify exactly where company cash is. Connecting treasury to the various entities within a group, and to the various banking partners, can be a challenge; of that there is no doubt. But as the development of web-based and SaaS/cloud technology progresses, so the ease with which connectivity can be improved increases. Being able to use data delivered by banks and affiliates in various formats via multiple communication methodologies is important. Being able to analyse the combined cash and risk elements is also a valuable part of effective mobilisation. It’s not only about how much the company has, but also how the amount, its location and accessibility affects the group’s consolidated results in terms of foreign exchange translation risk, counterparty risk and compliance with different regulations around cash and financial transactions, for example.</p>
<h3 id="long-term-challenge">Long-term challenge</h3>
<p>Whilst there is no one-size-fits-all offering for effective mobilisation of liquidity, there is an optimum solution for each business. If identification of the remedy requires complete visibility over cash (not just the balances but also where it is and what impact that cash has on the business) then this is the point at which proven technology comes into play.</p>
<p>The ability to capture, analyse and understand the right information is possible with the right software and advisory partners, which includes both banks and vendors. “Just as we try to use regulation as a proactive source, we see technology in much the same way,” says Kyhl. “It’s not only about how we can create and offer new and better products but also about advising clients on how they can best use the potential that exists in new technologies.”</p>
<p>The creation of an effective liquidity mobilisation programme is a long-term challenge in which the goal-posts are likely to move subject to the many variables that affect liquidity. The dynamic nature of the task and the impossibility of knowing every market nuance is why external partners – consultants, audit firms, tax specialists, banks, and so on – tend to be involved on an ongoing basis with internal constituencies such as tax, legal, accounting, finance and treasury.</p>
<p>The fact that it is a long-term project also means it is unlikely to be executed in one go, says Carey. But businesses that have grasped the nettle and started to create coherent and connected structures will benefit from improved visibility over their cash positions. Simply knowing with accuracy the basics such as how much, where and in which currency at any given time can improve forecasting and facilitate the optimisation of investment returns. It may also reduce the need and cost of borrowing and transactional banking. Firms that have optimised their cash structure could improve foreign exchange hedging and other risk costs whilst better understanding their strategic use of cash through various corporate actions such as M&amp;A, stock buyback and dividends. In effect, it makes businesses more competitive; as Kyhl points out, as long as the structure and technology implemented is able to grow with the project, treasury will be in a positon to keep ahead of the wave. But when the regulatory environment and the technical infrastructure lacks homogeneity, the treasurer faces a different set of issues.</p>
<h3 id="cash-mobilisation-in-emerging-economies">Cash mobilisation in emerging economies</h3>
<p>Trade in Africa represents an exciting opportunity for many corporates. Some of the 54 countries that make up the continent have the same – and in some cases better – levels of infrastructure and systems to assist financial movements, with full RTGS mechanisms, well-developed clearing houses that can handle electronic funds transfer (EFT), multi-currency transactions, direct debiting, and also home to more innovative payment solutions such as mobile money. But there are some that lag behind the rest of the world.</p>
<p>There is already significant corporate investment pouring in to all regions and the subsequent repatriation of funds represents a substantial volume of cash movement. But repatriation is not the only reason for mobilising liquidity in and out of Africa. “Often corporate treasurers are driven by a need to manage sovereign and currency risk by reducing exposure of their cash balances on the continent and putting them into more stable geographies,” explains Brendon Bouwer, Product Head of Liquidity Management &amp; Account Services – Corporate and Investment Banking division, Standard Bank.</p>
<p>Most of the markets in Africa have transfer pricing rules and attendant withholding taxes. However, variability is the watchword in many other aspects of cash movement. Uganda allows free movement of funds across its borders whereas in Angola a company requires permission from the central bank to move its cash. In Kenya, it is possible to clear dollars, pounds, euros and Kenyan shillings through the local clearing house as a domestic electronic funds transfer, whereas in South Africa, domestic purchase of goods and services must be paid for in South African rand only.</p>
<p>With this issue in mind, there is a strengthening regional component to cash movement, says David Robinson, Product Head of Payments and Collections, Corporate and Investment Banking division, Standard Bank. With the African Free Trade Zone overseeing the development of intra-regional trade co-operation, at the regional level, organisations include the 14-strong Southern African Development Community (SADC) which can facilitate (in most countries) same-day cross-border RTGS. The East African Community (EAC) is another regional intergovernmental organisation striving for a co-ordinated approach to trade and the movement of cash, with a regional RTGS implemented in certain EAC countries. Similar aims are held by the Economic Community of West African States (ECWAS) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (CMESA).</p>
<p>All are trying to create a movement similar the European SEPA model, forming a common payments infrastructure and encouraging freer trade amongst members. “It is still early days for these organisations,” says Robinson. He notes that unlike in Europe, the countries within these regional structures have not yet aligned regulations, such as exchange controls. They also do not share a common currency: SADC uses South Africa Rand as its settlement currency, while EAC uses or is planning to use all of the domestic EAC currencies, as well as USD, GBP and EUR.</p>
<p>Banks operating within this space don’t just need local understanding, they also must have the systems and the reach to be able to create solutions that fit this landscape. However, says Bouwer, there is also an issue with African countries wanting sovereignty and autonomy over these systems which means that when banks with regional footprints operate in their markets they want those systems to be localised. “Often it is not possible to run a service that uses a hub and spoke model; some authorities require the banking system to reside domestically and will put various restrictions on it to maintain control should there be a fall-out with the home country.”</p>
<p>Although the nature of the counterparty and the objective of a particular transaction will dictate the type of solution offered, these matters can combine to make the provision of domestic and cross-border movement of funds somewhat challenging for both bank and client. No bank in Africa reaches across the entire continent; Standard Bank is one of the largest, extending operations to around 18 of the 54 countries. But to reach further and facilitate transactions it has had to establish strategic correspondent banking relationships in what it calls ‘non-presence’ countries to allow those transactions to move into those markets. Nonetheless, he recognises that “nothing beats having a presence in-country and dealing with client needs in-house.”</p>
<p>For corporates entering the region, ‘traditional’ liquidity mobilisation solutions such as notional pooling and sweeping may be available, assuming local banking regulation will support it. Regardless of practical offering, the banking structure itself must be viewed in layers, advises Bouwer. Having created domestic and foreign currency accounts in each country, the localised structure should flow into a regional banking set-up which will ultimately flow into the client’s global banking structure. Typically, a business will establish a treasury unit in one of the regional co-operation zones mentioned above, taking advantage of relaxed exchange controls, foreign country movement reporting and so on. The need for on-the-ground help is perhaps more evident across Africa than in any other continent, says Bouwer. It is this knowledge that must be leveraged in the quest to optimise the mobilisation of liquidity.</p>

<p><i>From negative interest rates to significant currency volatility and geopolitical risk, today’s treasurers are operating in largely uncharted territory. Exploring and exploiting this new liquidity landscape will require skilful navigation – and an open mind.</i></p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p>With ongoing speculation around the future of the Eurozone, crisis-driven regulation still being implemented across the financial sector, and emerging economies continuing to outperform their Western counterparts, any casual observer could be forgiven for thinking that little has changed in the macro business environment over the last five years. But as any treasurer will tell you, nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
<p>The first and perhaps hardest hitting change – at least for those in the corporate treasury profession – is the introduction of negative interest rates. “Whilst interest rates have been extremely low across Europe and the US in recent years, the move by the European Central Bank (ECB) in June 2014 to lower the deposit rate from zero to -0.1% took us into a new phase in the interest rate cycle,” explains Amit Agarwal, EMEA Head of Liquidity Management Services, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi.</p>
<p>This triggered a domino effect of rate cuts across Europe with the Danish, Swedish and Swiss National Banks all choosing to follow suit in an effort to protect their currencies and reduce market volatility. “For treasurers, the impact of these changes in monetary policy is wide-reaching,” says Agarwal. “We are entering new territory when it comes to the traditional treasury priorities of security, liquidity and yield. Liquidity is being challenged by regulations such as Basel III, and yields on investments and currencies are scarce, but capital preservation is even trickier.</p>
<p>“Take investment policies, for example. These typically dictate that treasurers must retain capital and maintain the value of that capital, but doing so in a world where deposit rates are suddenly negative poses a real challenge.” As a result, many treasurers are left questioning the validity of their investment policies and priorities, as well as their accounting practices.</p>
<p>Treasurers are also still wondering where interest rates will go next, as they do not appear to have bottomed out yet. As Steven Elms, EMEA Head of Industrials Sector Sales, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi observes, “this uncertainty around rates is a genuine challenge for corporates trying to navigate the new business environment. Not only are they trying to understand where the policy moves are heading but also as to how banks are responding and how this will impact their deposits, investments and wider currency market movements.”</p>
<p>Against this backdrop of uncertainty, there is one safe bet, says Elms, namely that this new territory for interest and FX rates is here to stay, for the foreseeable future at least. “This is the new normal – and it is this environment that treasurers and banks need to be comfortable operating in.”</p>
<h3 id="adapting-to-change">Adapting to change</h3>
<p>What this means is that whilst it is important to continue to build on the best practices that have been honed within treasury departments in recent years, forward-looking treasurers must also examine ways to adapt and optimise their liquidity structures accordingly.</p>
<p>“One very noticeable trend that we are observing among leading treasuries is the conscious decision to exclude certain pockets of daily liquidity from global liquidity structures in response to the lower rate environment,” says Elms. After all, why should a company move balances away from a jurisdiction and incur an FX cost, only then to be impacted by the negative rate environment?</p>
<p>“As long as there is complete visibility over the cash and at a near-term use of that local liquidity, then leaving it in-country may be the best course of action,” he notes. “That said, it is still fundamentally important that the liquidity structure the company has in place allows the treasurer to move and mobilise that cash when needed – not least because of the level of geopolitical unrest today. Trapped cash is a growing concern in politically unstable countries, as is significant FX volatility, so having a flexible and nimble liquidity structure is now more important than ever.”</p>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="offsetting-the-negative">Offsetting the negative</h3>
<p>When we overlay all of these challenges – the negative rate, low yield environment; the geopolitical challenges which are creating further FX swings, sovereign and counterparty risk concerns; and of course the liquidity constraints of Basel III, “this creates a perfect environment for clients to sit down around the table with their banks and discuss the optimal liquidity structure that brings together the right mix of cash management, investment and the risk management tools, whilst observing best practice,” says Agarwal.</p>
<p>A good example of this is the work Citi has been undertaking with clients to help them meet their goal of capital preservation in this era of negative rates. “From an investment point of view, we have introduced smart investment options, such as the minimum maturity deposit, which provides enhanced returns over short tenor time deposits with a minimum notice period before funds can be withdrawn,” he explains.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, multicurrency cash pools – as part of a global liquidity structure – are proving extremely popular among Citi’s clients as a means to gain liquidity and operational efficiencies, whilst also replacing or at least reducing the need for FX swaps. “With a multicurrency pool, it is possible to offset charges in certain low-yielding currencies by changing the mix of the company’s assets and increasing those currencies which have a wider spread. Furthermore, for the day-to-day operating business, rather than having to spend resources and investment dollars executing FX transactions, they can effectively use the multicurrency cash pool as an implicit way of executing their FX swap transactions. With that in mind, we are seeing double digit growth in the adoption of cash pools, in particular the multicurrency cash pool,” notes Agarwal.</p>
<p>Recently, Flextronics, a leading end-to-end supply chain solutions company, worked with Citi to create a multi-currency pool for its EMEA operations. By automating the FX conversion and draining of pool funds to the US, 90% of the cash in Europe is now available to the US – including US dollars in Israel for the first time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are seeing more and more requests to set up actions that occur without manual intervention when a particular currency – typically a negative yielding one – reaches a specified amount.</p>
<p><cite>Steven Elms, EMEA Head of Industrials Sector Sales, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regulatory change is another driver behind the focus on multicurrency cash pools. According to Elms, a common request is to include the renminbi as part of a multicurrency pool structure, not only because it is an additional currency that can help to offset negative yields, but also because banks such as Citi have grown their capabilities in the currency (since it has been gradually liberalised by the Chinese authorities) to ensure that locally generated liquidity that was previously trapped in-country can now be brought up into a company’s central liquidity structure, even through automated sweeping options.</p>
<p>“Automation is another huge theme in this new liquidity environment,” Elms continues. “We are seeing more and more requests to set up actions that occur without manual intervention when a particular currency – typically a negative yielding one – reaches a specified amount.” Once the level is hit, Citi can then help to push some of that liquidity into a different destination; whether that be a higher yielding account with a longer maturity, or a money market fund, for example.</p>
<h3 id="embracing-the-positive">Embracing the positive</h3>
<p>“These kinds of innovations are only going to become more popular as people adjust to the new normal,” predicts Elms. And over the last five years, treasurers have already demonstrated great flexibility in their mind-sets, adjusting their investment comfort zones to include instruments such as tri-party repos and secured lending, so thinking outside the box has almost become part of the job description for those at the top of the profession.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if innovation is to succeed, it must be built on solid foundations – in this case best practice. “Now is not the time for treasurers to start undoing all of the hard work they have put in post-crisis, centralising, rationalising and automating their liquidity management. Rather, this is the time to examine how external market influences, such as negative interest rates, actually present opportunities for further efficiency,” concludes Agarwal.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>It is all well and good making profit overseas, but from a treasury perspective this generally desirable commercial goal can bring with it a set of issues that must be tackled correctly or cash can become the subject of punitive taxation, risk-laden currency exposure and even reputational damage. Cash repatriation is rarely straightforward – and sometimes controversial.</p>
<p>A Bloomberg investigation published in December 2010 (‘Dodging Repatriation Tax Lets US Companies Bring Home Cash’) revealed the dark secrets of schemes such as ‘The Killer B’ and ‘The Deadly D’ used to help to soften the tax blow for a number of high-profile corporates.</p>
<p>The Killer B earned its name from section 368(a)(1)(B) of the US Internal Revenue Code. The technique, explained Bloomberg reporter, Jesse Drucker, involved a US company selling its shares to an offshore subsidiary, the offshore unit could then use the stock to make an acquisition, tax-free. This loophole was apparently shut down by the IRS in 2006. The Deadly D – also named after a section of tax law – allows a US company to buy a business and transfer ownership to an existing overseas subsidiary. The subsidiary then pays its parent a sum of cash up to the purchase price of the company which the parent can repatriate, tax-free. Moves are afoot to close this one down too.</p>
<p>With so much at stake, why and how do treasurers bring cash home?</p>
<h3 id="the-consultants-view">The consultants’ view</h3>
<p>Reduction of gross debt on the balance sheet is one of the most common reasons for cash repatriation, says Paul Cuddihy, Head of Treasury and Commodity Management Consulting, KPMG. But over the past few years, managing counterparty credit risk has joined the list: cash in an overseas domestic bank account, as opposed to a global relationship bank, is an exposure too far for many treasurers. A third driver, notes Cuddihy, is cash recycling. “Quite often cash is taken from developed markets and invested in emerging market projects, for example for a new production facility.”</p>
<p>Tax-efficiency is never far from the conversation too, adds Chris Morgan, Head of Tax Policy, KPMG. Where a corporate with surplus cash is located in a high tax jurisdiction, lending to subsidiaries will generate a high tax charge on the interest received. “That does not make much sense especially where lending is not that company’s business. It may be beneficial to repatriate funds to the head office or to a treasury operation in a low tax jurisdiction and lend it out from here,” he says. However, when repatriating cash by way of dividends, the company could incur high withholding tax (paid to the jurisdiction in which the cash was residing) and, depending on the jurisdiction in which the parent company is registered, dividends might be subject to double taxation (as in the US).</p>
<p>Locating accounts in corporate tax friendly countries – such as Ireland with a rate of 12.5%, Andorra at 10% or, better still, Bahamas or Bermuda at 0% – is not without issue, as Google, Amazon and Starbucks found to their cost. They were not doing anything illegal, but many saw their actions as ‘unfair’. Reputational risk should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>The heated media and political debate around the tax planning efforts of corporates is likely to move up a gear as the country-by-country reporting template that is being discussed by the OECD takes shape. “If it looks like a company is trying to strip out as much of the profits as possible – particularly from a developing country – it will attract attention,” says Morgan. “It is”, he adds, “a matter of balancing prudent cash management with “not being seen to push the envelope”.</p>
<p>Regulatory guidance must be followed too. In certain jurisdictions, for example, Morgan warns that over-zealous removal of local cash reserves may breach local ‘thin capitalisation’ rules (applicable to companies funded almost entirely by debt). These rules are put in place partly to ensure local entities are able to continue operating. Accurate forecasting thus becomes more important. “Organisations that put in place automated cash pooling and sweeping structures often have to put in place more sophisticated forecasting and liquidity tools,” notes Cuddihy. The involvement of the banks in this process is “critical”.</p>
<p>Despite what they may claim, no bank has a truly global footprint. “What corporates tend to do is select a regional bank – for Asia, for EMEA, for the Americas – and these will link with the local banking network,” he explains. Local banks are best-placed to provide local cash services such as payments and collections. A net amount may then be moved between the local and regional banks. It is, he explains, important to select a regional bank that has a network capable of satisfying requirements both at a local and central level, even if that means using partner banks. The current wariness of counterparty risk does however make careful bank selection critical.</p>
<p>“The best corporate structure to facilitate the efficient repatriation of cash depends on many factors,” says Morgan. To enable a business to take dividends out with minimum withholding tax, for example, may require it to set up regional holding companies. It may be desirable to locate these in jurisdictions with favourable tax treaties, just as it may be equally beneficial to establish treasury centres in these locations, bearing in mind the reputational element. But with cash sweeping and pooling in the main free market areas already in place within most sophisticated organisations, Cuddihy notes that leading-edge organisations (notably in the pharmaceutical industry) are now implementing payments and receipts factories. “These structures remove the need for cash to be paid or received locally at all,” he explains.</p>
<h3 id="the-bankers-view">The banker’s view</h3>
<p>Treasurers are under increasing pressure to demonstrate the depth and rigour of their risk management, notes Paul Taylor, Managing Director, Regional Sales Head, GTS EMEA at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofAML). He believes few treasurers will today tolerate having cash spread across multiple jurisdictions for just this reason. “Whether it is counterparty risk, country, reputational or systemic risk, repatriation often feels like an easier way to manage and mitigate that risk.”</p>
<p>In particular, emerging market volatility and the advent of certain so-called ‘Black Swan’ events are a deep concern for treasurers who may not be on the ground as events unfold. Being able to respond quickly, diverting cash without closing down these markets is essential and international banks argue that they have the infrastructure to facilitate the essential visibility and access for effective cash repatriation.</p>
<p>For Taylor, repatriation is thus often based on “the intelligent management of cash pools”. A business may be managing cash in multiple pools, across multiple jurisdictions, but that cash can still be concentrated in markets where the greatest return and control can be achieved. A corporate with a multi-currency notional pool, he argues, can “optimise cash accessibility and return”.</p>
<p>The strategic need to manage cash and exposures may be driven by the CFO (and possibly the chief risk officer) but it is the treasurer who will most likely devise the solution. “This is where bank relationships play an important role,” says Taylor. The traditional banking service for repatriation is the sweeping and pooling of accounts. “As a business becomes more multi-national, it is required to put in place treasury structures and middleware to support that expansion. For a bank, the ability to support pooling, where the corporate objective is to optimise working capital management, is critical.”</p>
<p>Actual or notional pooling (combining account balances without actually transferring funds), either on a single or multi-currency basis, is necessarily driven by technology. It relies upon the bank having the access tools, infrastructure and reach to meet its clients’ needs. But Taylor believes the move into emerging markets and thus the increased threat of trapped cash is driving treasurers to look for “more intelligent” in-country solutions too. The global banks are responding by offering clients access to a variety of local short-term funds either on an entity- or country-specific basis, he says. “Where repatriation is not possible, this is a way in which treasurers can start to make more localised decisions on how to get the best possible return.”</p>
<p>A business should establish its repatriation strategy in advance of moving into a new territory. “A treasurer will be looking at ways in which that strategy can be supported by finding a solution that can get the cash to the right place,” says Taylor. Once past the investment phases, and assuming it has cash coming in, each entity will need a collections facility, an ability to manage that cash in the most effective way, and a well-defined approach to risk management, he explains. “Treasury won’t necessarily want to open accounts with domestic banks where the relationship is minimal,” he says. “The need is typically for something that is in step with how they manage the rest of their cash, which gives them the same visibility, control and scalability as they have for the majority of the business, which offers the same return, and which enables them to move the cash intelligently or deploy it back into that market if the business is not yet fully matured.”</p>
<h3 id="the-treasurers-view">The treasurer’s view</h3>
<p>There are two main reasons for bringing cash back to headquarters for Corina Keller, Head of Cash Management for Germany-based global specialty chemicals group, ALTANA: security and efficiency. This means all of the company’s core banking panel are highly-rated and that the structure of the business facilitates easier redeployment of funds from cash-rich entities to where it is needed. But Keller acknowledges that repatriation is rarely straightforward.</p>
<p>“The first consideration is whether the cash is in a currency and location that allows transfers out of the country,” she says. If not, it may be possible to exchange it in-country into euros or dollars and then remove it. However, she comments that the exchange rate is often quite unfavourable and, in China for example, there are restrictions on how much foreign currency may be held at one time. Even if cash is removed, it may be subject to a ‘fee’ in the originating country as is the case for example in Russia or China. Although not officially a tax, this is a cost nonetheless. “But tax is always a reason to think about how you might get the cash out,” Keller says. If, for example, the intention is to declare a dividend, the threat of double taxation – withholding tax paid at the point of origination and receipt – must be considered. “It is not a restriction in that we won’t do it, but we must bear in mind the level of withholding tax.”</p>
<p>Wherever possible, ALTANA requests SWIFT MT940 customer statements from each bank account held by its overseas entities to know the balance on each account. But just as there are some banks that technically cannot comply, some charge “horrendous” fees for this service. If ALTANA cannot find a way to get the money out, at least at an acceptable cost, it may grant the relevant local entity special leave to open an additional account with a branch of one of the group’s core banks. “At least then we know the funds are safe and that we have a good level of control over the cash.” All non-core banks are subject to group treasury’s ‘bank monitoring’ programme where it takes a weekly look at the ratings and outlook of each. It will then make decisions on what the highest acceptable positive balance limit should be, explains Keller. In some instances instructions have been issued to close an account and select another bank from a short-list of corporate treasury-approved institutions.</p>
<p>Operations in China require a different strategy. Because ALTANA has more than one entity in-country it has established an ‘entrusted loan’ structure. Similar to a cash pool, it means one entity will deposit cash with a bank, that bank then lends the cash to other ALTANA group entities. “It does reduce the need to send additional funds into a trapped-cash environment, but it still doesn’t solve the problem of getting cash out of the country,” admits Keller.</p>
<p>Cash may be removed in the form of an inter-company loan to HQ but the asset remains on the books of the foreign entity. This has major implications for the security of those funds. Keller marks the distinction between cash and assets. With the retention of the asset, if for some reason the economy of the country in which that asset is booked collapses and the government then seizes control of the company, that government could legally force the parent company to repay the loan.</p>
<p>“In a volatile world, should the need to extract cash from a country become urgent there is but one real option, says Keller, and that is to get the funds out in the form of a dividend.” By declaring a dividend the cash and the asset are no longer on the books of that entity. But, as mentioned above, this can be expensive: “Sometimes you have to take a deep breath and swallow hard when you hear how much you must pay on withholding taxes.” Another way to remove the funds is by merging the company into another within the group. This, notes Keller, “takes even longer to do and there are more fees involved than paying a dividend.” And obviously, this is only an option if the local entity is no longer needed.</p>
<p>Under ‘normal’ circumstances, where repatriation is possible, ALTANA relies upon its core banking partners to connect into a traditional cash pool. Cash is automatically swept every day to a header account. But even in this scenario there may be legal restrictions on what can and can’t be moved; cross-border pooling or participation by certain company structures is not permitted by some jurisdictions, for example.</p>
<p>The main instrument used by ALTANA to disperse cash is the inter-company loan. “We might instruct an entity to grant a loan to HQ and it will send us the cash for us to invest, pay-down debt or lend it to another entity,” explains Keller. If making an internal loan, interest rates must be set at ‘arms-length’, reflecting the kind of rate achievable by the borrowing (or lending) entity in the open market and based on treasury’s similarly arms-length assessment of the entity’s credit risk.</p>
<p>“About the only good thing about the current low interest rate environment is that through inter-company lending we can repatriate most of the funds for next to nothing,” comments Keller. However, she adds, “it is not necessarily the main goal of corporate treasury to repatriate all funds”. The first view a treasurer has of in-country cash is usually an amount in a bank account. This is not necessarily the amount that can be repatriated, she warns. Given the complexities and anomalies likely to be faced, and given that treasury may not be aware of every in-country need for funding (eg. pension payments, ongoing legal processes, licence or tender applications and so on), it is possible that a multi-functional review may be required, consulting, for example, with the controlling, tax and legal teams. “There are always exceptions or reasons as to why it makes sense to leave some funds in-country.” But with more than 60 subsidiaries and associated companies around the world, and over 80% of group sales derived outside of Germany, the movement of ALTANA’s cash is never taken lightly.</p>

<figure class="portrait left"><img alt="Portrait of Stephen Hogan" height="150" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/2014/07/2014-07and-08-tta-03-qa-stephen-hogan-100x150.jpg" width="100"/></figure>
<h5 id="stephen-hogan-deutsche-post-dhl">Stephen Hogan, Vice President, Regional Treasury, Asia Pacific, Deutsche Post DHL:</h5>
<p>At Deutsche Post DHL we operate a global in-house bank based in Germany and its solutions have been deployed across Asia Pacific. This has offered many benefits, both financial and non-financial, to our operations in the region, especially in free-market countries such as Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan, where we have been able to deploy the full range of services the in-house bank can offer.</p>
<p>A key benefit of the in-house bank is that it complements our zero-balance cash pooling in the region’s free market economies. The increased visibility which it offers allows us to effectively complete a two-way sweeping process on a daily basis from the subsidiaries to the in-house bank. We are then able to record the balances against the subsidiaries and pinpoint where these have come from, giving the group increased transparency.</p>
<p>The in-house bank also provides solutions for intercompany settlements which offers numerous benefits, such as removing the requirement of third-party banks when conducting intercompany payments. This creates cost savings for the subsidiaries as they no longer have to pay banks’ transaction fees. Also, exchange rate risk is removed from any intercompany cross-border transactions as these are carried out within the in-house bank at a pre-determined exchange rate.</p>
<p>As well as cost savings, the in-house bank also helps streamline the intercompany payment process. Historically, we would have a large amount of intercompany payments and in some cases there were delays between payments. However, since the introduction of the in-house bank we have consolidated these and now run payments on a monthly cycle. In doing so we have alleviated the worry for subsidiaries, regarding any outstanding receivables or collection of payments from sister companies. The subsidiaries are therefore able to use their time more effectively and focus on collecting from their external customers.</p>
<p>The in-house bank also assists in limiting FX risk by centralising the group’s currencies and offering the subsidiaries the ability to hedge any FX exposure from local third parties. In doing so the FX risk is passed on to the group at the central level through the in-house bank, thus protecting the local subsidiary.</p>
<p>Despite all the benefits there are a number of challenges which have to be overcome when implementing an in-house bank across the region. Key to this are the regulatory challenges posed in many countries, meaning that often the full range of solutions cannot be deployed. For example, in some countries we may be able to run the intercompany settlement process but will be unable to deploy the cash pooling process.</p>
<p>It is therefore imperative that the treasury recognises the local regulations in each country and appreciates that the region cannot be approached with a one-size-fits-all policy. A key requirement when implementing the in-house bank is to have flexibility and to have a detailed understanding of the nuances of each country. To obtain this information treasury should work with its tax advisors, legal advisors and banking partners to ensure that it has the correct local information to implement the in-house bank successfully.</p>
<p>Finally, the challenges posed when implementing an in-house bank in the region means that it is important that the whole group is committed to the project. This is particularly important at local level, where the project cannot be pushed through like a directive. The teams on the ground will need to understand the benefits they will obtain as they will be vital in providing feedback on local practices and regulations which will further assist in its implementation.</p>
<figure class="portrait left"><img alt="Portrait of Martijn Stoker" height="150" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/2014/07/2014-07and-08-tta-03-qa-martijn-stoker-100x150.jpg" width="100"/></figure>
<h5 id="martijn-stoker-jp-morgan">Martijn Stoker, Head of Liquidity and Escrow Product, Asia Pacific, J.P. Morgan:</h5>
<p>Reducing your company’s bank borrowing, reducing your cost of FX transactions, cutting interest payments on your debt and improving the yield on your investments: which treasurer wouldn’t be interested? Centralising your treasury into an in-house bank can achieve all of this – and more – but it is not a quick fix.</p>
<p>An in-house bank can be best described as a centralised treasury organisation performing activities for subsidiaries that were traditionally performed by multiple banks. And, as with any fragmented and de-centralised operational process or platform, challenges are presented in the form of an inefficient business, stubbornly high costs and a lack of insight and visibility into a company’s overall financial position.</p>
<p>To meet these challenges, treasurers and CFOs are increasingly establishing in-house banks with a view to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bundling expertise in a single location to become a centre of excellence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimising liquidity via intercompany lending arrangements, netting and centralised payment/collections, thus reducing bank facilities and funds trapped in the clearing cycle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improving pricing performance due to increased scale and volume, creating negotiating power for banking fees, FX dealing and rates products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimising the utilisation of a sophisticated treasury management system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Achieving cost efficiencies by creating pooled resources in treasury, finance and IT.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence, the basis of an in-house bank is to operate the in-house bank accounts, over which all funding, investment and hedging activities flow. Centralising these activities into a centre of excellence will enhance your control, visibility and risk management practices significantly.</p>
<p>Our clients in Asia Pacific who have centralised their investment management have seen an improvement to their overall yield and indicated that this has enhanced their counterparty risk profile significantly. The specialised team that oversees the in-house bank will be better positioned to determine the investment risks and can decide on the optimal allocation. Other activities that benefit from setting up an in-house bank are the FX dealings, whereby increased volume and improved expertise will result in more efficient hedges and improved pricing, thus optimising the firm’s risk-return equation.</p>
<p>The benefit of an in-house bank operation is usually re-allocated proportionately across the subsidiary structure by sharing both the costs and the benefits from the improved yield, quality of cash and risk management operations.</p>
<p>The key for a successful in-house bank structure anywhere in the world is to get it right from the start. A trivial decision on the in-house bank entity’s country of incorporation could have a negative knock-on effect further down the road.</p>
<p>Also, taking the control away from the subsidiaries can change attitudes and skills. When local management is less concerned about cash flows than at parent level you could end up with an issue. This is similarly true for changes in local regulations, especially in Asia Pacific. When the in-house bank is completely separated from local markets and industry developments, new opportunities might be missed, so one of the most important objectives when establishing an in-house bank is setting a clear and transparent operational structure that combines good regional governance with an appropriate level of in-country expertise</p>
<p>Setting up an in-house bank in Asia Pacific will still deliver all the above benefits. This, however, requires the full support from the top of the organisation and a dedicated and experienced in-house bank project team supported by the right partners.</p>
<figure class="portrait left"><img alt="Portrait of Mohit Mehrotra" height="150" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/2014/07/2014-07and-08-tta-03-qa-mohit-mehrotra-100x150.jpg" width="100"/></figure>
<h5 id="mohit-mehrotra-deloitte">Mohit Mehrotra, Executive Director, Deloitte Consulting:</h5>
<p>As the roles and responsibilities of treasury have expanded, treasury groups in Asia Pacific have been focusing on gaining greater visibility into a company’s funding needs, better deployment of internal liquidity sources and optimising working capital. Creating an in-house bank structure can be part of a strategy an organisation adopts to meet these demands.</p>
<p>Having an in-house bank allows an organisation to efficiently manage intercompany transactions between internal divisions and subsidiaries via internal virtual accounts. These accounts are used to automatically clear both internal and external cash flows. An in-house bank also enables the organisation to capture and centralise intercompany transactions, thereby reducing its foreign exchange transactions and resulting external banking costs. Another benefit of an in-house bank is that it increases visibility and control over functions such as cash concentration, cash positioning and cash flow forecasting, all of which may contribute to better liquidity management and improved decision-making around investments and funding requirements.</p>
<p>The typical goals for setting up an in-house bank include reducing financial transaction costs, reducing the cash collection time, increasing visibility to global cash positions, improving foreign exchange risk management practices and standardising bank communications.</p>
<p>As best practice, an in-house bank should have a centralised internal banking structure that can offer opportunities to rationalise bank accounts as well as relationships with banking partners across the organisation. Associated bank account administration activities can be consolidated and managed by one central group that can be located in the most cost efficient centres.</p>
<p>In-house banks should also implement efficient cash concentration structures. Cash pooling can be complex in Asia Pacific, due to jurisdictional, tax and legal restrictions. Therefore when establishing efficient pooling structures, various areas of the organisation should be consulted owing to interdependencies including tax, legal, accounting, account administration, accounts payable, accounts receivable and technology.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[


<p>The umbrella structure of an overlay cash pool can offer corporates with internationally-diverse operations another dimension to their liquidity management. But it can be time-consuming to implement, and regulatory restrictions on banks could limit their incentive to provide the service. What do treasuries need to know about the arrangement?</p>


<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Keeping control of liquidity can be a massive challenge at a multinational corporation (MNC) with diverse entities and numerous bank accounts across countries and currencies. Overlay cash pooling is one way such companies can keep close control of their cash, while also deriving cost benefits. Recent advances in technology and multi-bank capabilities have been key growth drivers.</p>
<p>An overlay cash pool is the top layer of a cash pooling structure in which liquidity is concentrated. Liquidity and interest can be offset through this top layer, which operates as an umbrella-type structure above a network of underlying regional and local accounts or account pools, which can be with the same bank as the overlay pool or with different, local banks. “The aim is to have one top-layer per group, and then under this you have a network of other structures. This serves as the treasury ‘cockpit’, allowing you to connect to any other accounts you like in the structure below, more or less anywhere around the globe,” says Paula Da Silva, Head of Working Capital Management at SEB.</p>
<p>The exact structure used depends on a corporate’s overall strategy, its treasury structure, its tax and legal structure, the accounting rules and policies in the jurisdictions in which it operates, and its business objectives – for example, whether it intends to concentrate its cash for investment purposes, or to pay down debt. Overlay cash pools, just like regional cash pools, can take the form of zero- or target-balancing (where funds are physically moved to or from operating accounts in order to achieve a single net cash position in a centralised account), or notional pooling (where there is no physical movement of funds). Multi-bank overlay structures must be pooled on a physical basis, whereas single bank structures can be operated on a physical or notional basis. Funds from local currency accounts in the pool can be transferred to the overlay bank, and subsequently converted into a single currency using the bank’s automated FX rate engine – this can save treasuries time and money in eliminating the need to carry out FX transactions on its positions. Alternatively, with multicurrency pools, cash remains in the original currency and is not physically moved; instead, the overlay bank notionally calculates all the balances in the pool in to a single base currency for the purposes of interest calculation.</p>
<p>Hybrid multi-bank overlay structures are also possible, whereby funds move from one bank to another, before participating in a notional structure. This eliminates the FX stage of the process, thus saving time and reducing costs. With multi-bank structures, transfers of cash can be made in two different ways: via a ‘push’, wherein the local bank pushes remaining balances up to the overlay bank; or via a ‘pull’, wherein the overlay bank executes the transaction to sweep from, or credit to, the local bank. Both the ‘push’ and ‘pull’ methods are usually executed at a pre-defined time every day.</p>
<p>However, overlay pooling, at least on a physical basis, differs from local and regional cash pooling in that the sweeping or funding of balances between the various local banks and the overlay-providing bank can sometimes require manual transfers, as a result of currency controls or jurisdiction controls, as is the case in Brazil, Russia and South Africa, for example. Overlay structures also carry the risk that the final end-of-day balance after the clearing cut-off may be missed. Furthermore, the transfer of back- and future-value days is not possible with overlay structures. Later on we will see some of the other challenges of the practice.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Despite these limitations, for corporates of a certain size and geographical diversity there are several key benefits of the method.</p>
<h3 id="interest-optimisation">Interest optimisation</h3>
<p>The principal advantage of overlay cash pooling is the visibility and control it provides to enable interest optimisation. As the structure allows corporates to use a single bank to draw down funds into a central location, the more efficient use of cash helps offset a corporate’s liquidity positions, enabling it to then either enhance the interest a corporate receives or alternatively to reduce the cost of its debt.</p>
<p>In addition to this optimisation of interest, overlaying also helps a corporate mitigate some of the risks that come with having entity accounts spread across countries and currencies. “Overlay cash pooling is a powerful risk management tool. Treasuries can better manage currency and geographical risk, as well as their internal risk, by only allowing a controlled, identified group of people to manage liquidity across all entity accounts,” explains Etienne Bernard, Head of Global Transaction Services Western Europe at RBS. It also provides greater visibility of a company’s overall cash position, allowing it to more efficiently manage its FX positions and facilitate improved reporting and reconciliation of these positions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From a more strategic perspective, overlay structures enable corporates to retain their autonomy of funds, as cash is channelled through a single top-level entity, such as with an in-house bank-type model. Furthermore, overlay structures can provide tax benefits to corporates, if the cash is concentrated in a tax-efficient location.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The structure can also help with a company’s operating liquidity. “Overlay cash pooling can drive real efficiencies in terms of corporates’ working capital,” says Suzanne Janse van Rensburg, Regional Head of Liquidity and Investments, GTS EMEA at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “It allows companies to segment their working capital from the excess balances to gain an enhanced yield.”</p>
<p>From a more strategic perspective, overlay structures enable corporates to retain their autonomy of funds, as cash is channelled through a single top-level entity, such as with an in-house bank-type model. Furthermore, overlay structures can provide tax benefits to corporates, if the cash is concentrated in a tax-efficient location. Beyond these key benefits, overlay cash pooling can also reduce the time treasury staff need to manually intervene in the administrative handling of accounts. However, the inherent scale and scope of overlay arrangements can also present significant challenges to the treasurer.</p>
<h3 id="overlay-challenges">Overlay challenges</h3>
<p>Complexities can arise from the geographical scope of the overlay – for example, differences in cut-off times, taxation and regulation between jurisdictions covered by the structure need to be considered. The structure can also lead to cash being trapped in countries where there are restrictions on the repatriation of cash.</p>
<p>In terms of regulation, corporates may find that as a result of Basel III, some banks could start cutting back somewhat on their overlay cash pooling offer.</p>
<p>“Basel III will impact the operational business of a lot of banks. As this regulation comes into play next year, we may start to see that some banks will step away from offering a global overlay without the underlying working capital business,” says BAML’s Janse van Rensburg.</p>
<p>“In an overlay structure where several banks are used for regional cash pooling and another bank is providing the overlay, the bank doing the global overlay would not be getting any of the benefit of the underlying fees business – and this would have an additional cost in terms of high quality liquid assets (HQLAs) required to be held against that piece of business by that bank. If the overlay bank has at least some of the regional operating business, its HQLA requirement would be 25%. However, with just the global overlay, the HQLA requirement is actually 40% – so it could potentially be more costly for a bank to provide a global overlay structure going forward in the Basel III world. Some banks may look to price that in, which could negate some of the benefit to a client of using the structure,” she explains.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Overlay cash pool structures with physical movements can upset the management of local entities, if they don’t want to lose control of their credit balances. It can be quite a political thing for the treasury to implement.”</p>
<p><cite>Marcus Hughes, Director of Business Development, Bottomline Technologies.</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Company law in certain jurisdictions can also impact the use of overlay structures. Inter-company loans are forbidden or extremely complex in some countries, such as China, rendering zero-balancing overlay cash pooling virtually impossible, while some central banks impose balance sheet reporting requirements that do not allow companies to report offset onto their balance sheets.</p>
<p>The implementation of overlay structures can sometimes also lead to internal conflict within a company. “Overlay cash pool structures with physical movements can upset the management of local entities, if they don’t want to lose control of their credit balances. It can be quite a political thing for the treasury to implement,” says Marcus Hughes, Director of Business Development at Bottomline Technologies.</p>
<h3 id="overlay-cash-pooling-tips">Overlay cash pooling tips</h3>
<p>Setting up a structure of this nature can take time – six months is not unusual in some treasuries. “Preparing the documentation for an overlay cash pool is time-consuming,” says Bottomline’s Hughes. “If a treasury’s thinking of embarking on a project like this, they’ve really got to be prepared to free up a significant amount of time and human resources. They’re going to have to select the banks to include in the pool, and decide on the technology – be it bank or non-bank technology.”</p>
<p>RBS’s Bernard says there are a number of key factors corporates should consider before implementing an overlay structure. Firstly the corporate should ensure the bank providing the overlay structure has a broad enough geographical scope to cover the countries and currencies in which the company’s entities operate. Secondly, the corporate should enquire what level of reporting and support the bank can offer the treasury, as well as whether the reporting can be integrated into its existing ERP systems.</p>
<p>And finally the corporate must decide which entities it would like to include in the overlay structure: some entities may carry such small residual balances that they do not warrant including in an overlay structure. “With some accounts, it’s just not worth it, because if the amounts moved are really low, the transfer fees could be greater than the net benefit,” says Bottomline Technologies’ Hughes; other entities may operate in a regulatory environment where it is impossible, or at least prohibitively complicated and costly, to participate in an overlay cash pool.</p>
<h3 id="overlays-in-the-future">Overlays in the future</h3>
<p>Overlay cash pooling looks set to remain a fixture in the liquidity management setups of many corporates for some time to come. However, the structure may well evolve as the credit environment and the needs of corporates themselves change.</p>
<p>Bottomline Technologies’ Hughes believes that as liquidity becomes tighter and payments become increasingly real-time, banks’ charging structures on overlay cash pools could change radically. “In the future, as money can be moved faster, and as intra-day liquidity becomes more sought after, systems will be required to deal with the complexity of moving money between the accounts in a structure more quickly and calculating interest, not just overnight, but also intra-day,” he says. “At certain times of the day, particularly towards the end of the day, using money is going to become more expensive and is likely to be charged – by the hour, or even by the minute.”</p>
<p>Anna Maria Nyström, Head of Liquidity Products at SEB feels the structure could also be rolled out more efficiently to new territories as regulation evolves. “Overlay cash pooling structures will continue to be a very important feature for treasuries going forward, and the world is opening up and regulation is evolving, presenting new opportunities,” she says. “Bank solutions will have to support corporates in dealing with the time zone challenges in overlay structures to make sure that more of the world is covered in an efficient way. The services should then develop – we will see a greater number of currencies and geographies included in more advanced services as time goes by.”</p>
<p>She also believes the visibility offered by overlay solutions will become increasingly important. “Access to information and reporting through these solutions will be crucial – not only visualising balances, but also having more in-depth information during intra-day periods,” she explains.</p>
<p>But beyond being adapted for use in countries where they are not currently widespread, such as China, SEB’s da Silva says overlay arrangements could also be deployed for new types of cash flows.</p>
<p>“In the past overlay cash pools have typically only been used to channel traditional cash flows, especially in OECD countries. But we can do much more to include a wider range of activity in these structures. For instance, trade finance-based cash flows tend to stay outside overlay cash pool solutions – this is an area where we can look to create benefits for corporates in the future,” she says.</p>
<p>It now remains to be seen which path overlay structures will take. Will they be successfully expanded to new territories, and to new kinds of cash flows, such as trade finance? Or will regulation, such as Basel III, restrict the attractiveness to banks of offering the umbrella arrangement?</p>

<h4 class="fn">Oliver Petersen</h4>
<h5 class="title">Global Head of Supply Chain Finance</h5>
<br/>
<img alt="ING" class="logo org" height="22" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/ing-logo-2012-90x22.png" width="90"/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Oliver Petersen is the head of ING’s Supply Chain Finance. The team seeks to optimise the working capital positions of both a buyer and its suppliers on a global basis. Established in 2010, the Supply Chain Finance team leverages ING’s international footprint with operational teams based in The Netherlands, Romania and Russia. Before this, Petersen was a Director in ING’s Structured Finance Telecom, Media and Technology department and worked for ING’s Corporate Credit Risk Management department. He holds an international MBA from the University of Nyenrode.</p>

<p>Over the last three years there has been a consistent improvement in working capital performance among Europe’s largest publicly traded companies. In fact, statistics from REL’s 2013 Europe Working Capital Survey show a significant six per cent increase in working capital performance year-on-year. This level of improvement suggests that companies not only understand, but actively recognise, the importance of working capital in an uncertain economic environment. Working capital is suddenly much more than just a product; it is a philosophy.</p>
<h3 id="leveraging-assets">Leveraging assets</h3>
<p>“Lessons have been learned,” says Robert O’Donoghue, Global Head of Working Capital Management, Transaction Services at ING, referring to the global financial crisis and the banking sector restructuring and regulation that resulted from it. “In the not too distant past, many companies took advantage of cheap bank funding sources, with little regard for their overall funding mix. Now there is much more focus on what constitutes near-term liquidity; what constitutes longer-term liquidity; and where companies can create cash and liquidity using their own resources.”</p>
<p>With REL’s research revealing that approximately €762 billion remains tied up in excess working capital across Europe, the opportunity for companies to leverage their existing resources in this context is obvious. The question is: how can these opportunities be realised in the most efficient manner?</p>
<p>“In early 2012, ING took the decision to package all of its working capital solutions into one department, with the aim of putting the client even more at the centre of our offering. The Working Capital Solutions team brings together the receivables side of the business and the payables side. It aims to help our client find the best way, and the optimal timing, to put the right solutions in place, with the least impact on their day-to-day business,” notes O’Donoghue.</p>
<p>This requires not just a portfolio of leading-edge working capital solutions, but genuine insight into industry trends and best practice; a deep understanding of how individual businesses function – and how they compare with their peers; as well as a holistic approach to identifying and implementing sustainable working capital strategies. ING does not disappoint.</p>
<h3 id="trend-watch">Trend watch</h3>
<p>While ING has a long track record in helping clients with their working capital needs, the bank does not rest on its laurels. As Leon Merkun, Managing Director Transaction Services Solutions Group at ING and former corporate treasurer puts it: “The working capital solutions that every international bank offers are usually comparable. What makes ING stand out from the crowd are the people who work here and their drive and flexibility to come up with tailored solutions, the background they have, and their understanding of what our clients’ priorities, objectives and constraints are.”</p>
<p>Maintaining this edge means keeping a finger on the pulse and picking up on trends that are influencing the way that corporates see working capital solutions. “For example,” says Amador Malnero, Global Head of Trade Receivable Purchase Programme at ING, “selling your receivables in a factoring solution was historically perceived quite negatively, because it was seen as the ‘lender of last resort’. Today, people look at their receivables very differently – they are as an asset class that can and should be monetised.”</p>
<p>Likewise, perceptions around supply chain finance solutions are changing. Oliver Petersen, Global Head of Supply Chain Finance, ING, explains: “The conversations we are having with suppliers are becoming easier as more supply chain programmes are rolled out – largely because a lot more suppliers now know about the benefits. Some suppliers still find it hard to believe that there is no catch to SCF, but that is the only major mind-set hurdle still to overcome. SCF is really gaining traction as a sustainable way to strengthen the overall value chain by allowing buyers to extend their payable terms while helping suppliers to deleverage the balance sheet.”</p>
<p>Another interesting trend is the movement among cutting-edge corporates to raise awareness of working capital outside of the finance function. This is fast becoming a best practice model for corporates across the globe.</p>
<h3 id="best-practice-taking-the-next-step">Best practice: taking the next step</h3>
<p>“One of the greatest challenges is to make sure that working capital management is not just a one-off project, but to make sure that it is embedded in the business,” says Merkun. “To achieve this, finance and the business must work together. The business must be as responsible, or perhaps even more responsible, for the management of working capital than the finance function.”</p>
<p>Best practice also demands an integrated approach, Merkun adds. “You can’t just look at accounts receivable, accounts payable or inventory in isolation. You need to consider the bigger picture. Looking at optimising your inventory for example, you need to make sure that you are still able to meet the level of demand from clients.” This requires regular input on how demand is developing. At the same time, the demand forecast should be transferred into the supply chain to make sure that there are sufficient resources available to cover the level of demand.</p>
<p>According to Merkun, “that’s often where the challenges lie: to maintain the discipline and ensure that everybody is involved. Weekly or monthly sales and operations meetings can help, together with regular follow-up actions.” Forging a stronger link between procurement and finance can also be useful here, generating opportunities to ask whether the company is extracting the best terms from its trade relationships (different business entities often buy with the same supplier at different terms); how those terms compare to competitors; and how key suppliers in the supply chain can be better supported.</p>
<p>As an additional means to ensure that different business functions and entities are on the same page when it comes to working capital, leading companies are also moving towards centralised control of working capital within group treasury. “It’s a question of scale and uniformity,” says O’Donoghue. “If you have subsidiaries without a common goal, there are likely to be inefficiencies. Centralisation can help you to vastly improve on efficiency, not only operationally but also through the consolidation of budget, which could potentially allow the company to invest in a more sophisticated IT infrastructure to better support the company’s working capital, for instance.”</p>

<h3 id="looking-ahead-thinking-forward">Looking ahead, thinking forward</h3>
<p>Talking about best practice is all well and good when working capital management is very much front of mind still for corporates, but as the economic climate starts to pick up, will companies push working capital management onto the back burner again? O’Donoghue thinks not: “Solid working capital management is something that companies absolutely need to invest in for the future. Diversification of funding sources through working capital solutions is an excellent way for companies to demonstrate to shareholders that they are running an efficient operation. It is also a useful way to demonstrate commitment and value to relationship banks.”</p>
<p>So how can companies ride the current momentum around working capital to put in place a structure that will serve them well over the longer term? “If it’s not seen as a priority, it’s not going to happen,” says Merkun. “In this case, it’s a question of helping senior management and other stakeholders to see the value in working capital management.” An extremely useful tool for doing this is peer analysis, he says, which is something that ING specialises in.</p>
<p>A peer comparison can alert you, and your management team, to potential areas of improvement in working capital performance. “It also allows ING, as working capital specialists, to challenge the client around their current working capital performance, and allows the client to challenge us in return,” notes O’Donoghue. A typical conversation might proceed along the lines of: ‘are your competitors more working capital efficient than you are? If so, why are they doing it? No doubt because there is a benefit in doing so.’</p>
<p>“At that point, we can start to look at the solutions which would work best for the client, bringing efficiencies with the least disruption to their day-to-day operations,” he explains. “Can we use securitisation techniques in order to monetise receivables portfolios? Or on the payables side, how can they use their credit rating to better support their suppliers while improving their own DPO?”</p>
<p>O’Donoghue makes it very clear however, that this is just the tip of the iceberg. There is very much a ‘no one size fits all’ mentality at ING. Client challenges are often unique in circumstance, therefore solutions are often tailor-made.</p>
<p>“We like to really know our clients, understand their working capital and get under the skin of their supply chain – both from a financial and physical perspective. If there is something in the business of concern, we will always strive to find a solution for the client. ING is an extremely loyal supporter of its clients, and we always aim to work as a constructive partner with our clients,” he comments.</p>
<p>This partnership approach means working alongside clients not just in the choice of solution, but in the implementation of it too. “We are integrated in the client’s project,” says Petersen. “What makes us so well positioned to do this are the diverse backgrounds and experience of our Working Capital Solutions team. We have experts from all walks of banking and corporate life. This means that we have a good understanding of working capital from the corporate’s point of view, and that we understand the need for balance between short- and the long-term liquidity. Leveraging this knowledge base, we can package and implement solutions that really fit the bill for our clients.”</p>
<p>The Working Capital Solutions team is also extremely well placed to pinpoint what makes a working capital strategy truly successful. O’Donoghue says: “overhauling your company’s working capital strategy will take some resourcing and it won’t happen overnight, but to give you the best shot at making it work, a commonality of thinking will be required. If, for example, your procurement department is driven by getting the cheapest price and the treasury department that is driven by cash preservation, you’ve got a conflict. You need common KPIs and goals to make the project run more smoothly.” In addition to alignment of KPIs, senior level support is also critical, says Malnero. “This means securing buy-in from upper level management, right the way through from the CEO to the CFO.”</p>
<p>Only once these fundamentals are in place will companies be able to cast off the notion that working capital is something to be taken for granted. Working capital will instead be seen as an area that deserves critical attention from all stakeholders, and a potential source of value to be monetised.</p>

<h3 id="solutions-suite">Solutions suite</h3>
<h4 id="scf">Supply chain finance (SCF)</h4>
<p>A working capital optimisation tool, SCF unlocks cash, trapped both within a company and in the value chain with key suppliers. ING purchases the approved trade receivables that suppliers have on a given buyer, essentially stepping into the shoes of the supplier. Subsequently ING will receive payment from the buyer when the invoice becomes due.</p>
<p>Benefits for the buyer include a reduction of working capital and increase of free cash flow through extended payment terms as well as the potential to improve relationships with suppliers, creating opportunities to negotiate better terms and conditions. Meanwhile, suppliers benefit from instant liquidity through early payment of invoices and lower financing costs.</p>



<blockquote>ING offers a fully automated web-based SCF solution, which complies with the highest possible security standards and is designed to have a limited impact on existing operations.</blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source">Oliver Petersen, Global Head of Supply Chain Finance, ING</p>


<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<h4 id="trade-receivables-purchase-programme">Trade receivables purchase programme</h4>
<p>Providing an alternative funding solution, ING’s trade receivables purchase programme (TRRP) is based on securitisation techniques, by purchasing large and diversified portfolios of trade receivables. The transfer of receivables is typically executed via a true sale of the receivables to ING or to a special purpose vehicle (SPV).</p>
<p>The TRRP is an attractive source of committed funding, which offers competitive pricing up to an AA equivalent rating as well as anonymous access to financial markets. It is also a strong balance sheet management tool to improve financial ratios and overall pricing. ING has a successful track record with over 250 TRPP programmes completed. An experienced team of professionals is available to cover all aspects of a TRPP transaction, from feasibility assessment to documentation.</p>


<blockquote>The fact that the receivables securitisation programme can sit comfortably next to other forms of financing is just one of the features that makes it attractive.</blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source">Michel Jansen, CFO of Clondalkin – ING client</p>


<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<h4 id="international-corporate-receivables-financing">International corporate receivables financing</h4>
<p>Facilitating clients in raising liquidity through the financing of trade receivables, inventory and purchase orders, ING is able to take over debtor risk. The solution can be tailored to the needs of clients as a one-off trade receivable purchase or as a facility for multiple receivables from the same debtor or group of debtors. Receivables financing can be done with recourse or on a non-recourse basis (the latter can potentially achieve off-balance sheet treatment).</p>


<blockquote>The benefits include diversification of funding sources, scalability to help finance trading growth at attractive pricing; and the flexibility to capture everything from single debtor receivables to multi-jurisdiction pools in a single transaction structure.</blockquote>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Whilst some challenges facing corporate treasurers are similar to those experienced in developed markets, emerging market volatility tends to be more intense, with heightened political and market risk. And depending upon which market(s) a multinational company (MNC) is operating in, it may also find that the regulatory environment is subject to change at short notice, with restrictions on free flow of liquidity and capital being quite typical.</p>
<h3 id="risk-factors">Risk factors</h3>
<p>Much of the emerging market growth over the past few years has been fuelled by significant in-flow of capital from developed markets in the form of portfolio and foreign direct investment (FDI). With the tapering of quantitative easing (QE) in the US, emerging market liquidity has been put under pressure. In turn, this is impacting local currencies’ exchange and interest rates as many investors head back to safety.</p>
<p>Turkey provides an interesting example here, says Amit Agarwal, EMEA Head of Liquidity Management Services, Citi, since the country has certain particularities such as a current account deficit, a slowdown in domestic demand, and recent political uncertainty. In an attempt to stem the decline of Turkish Lira, the country’s central bank raised its benchmark rate by a significant 400 basis points earlier this year. But Turkey is not alone – other emerging markets such as South Africa, Brazil, India and Indonesia are also facing similar currency pressures. This volatility in currency and interest rates entails risks for international corporates with a local presence and needs to be managed carefully at Group level – on a country-by-country basis. After all, while emerging markets are often spoken about en masse, they are actually very idiosyncratic. Treasurers therefore need to monitor and adjust their liquidity strategy, in line with the specific risks each operating geography presents, in order to manage counterparty and liquidity risks effectively, while also optimising excess balances.</p>
<p>Tapering also accounted for pressure on local currencies in Russia and Kazakhstan in the beginning of 2014. In response to a gradual devaluation of Russian rouble that started in January 2014, the National bank of Kazakhstan announced a sharp devaluation of Kazakhstan tenge on 12<sup>th</sup> February, resulting in significant tenge short-term rate volatility. The move also saw major local players as well as consumers switching to foreign currency says Emre Karter, Central and Eastern Europe Cluster Head for Citi’s Treasury and Trade Solutions.</p>
<p>Although a growth market for many multinationals, Russia is facing a number of challenges on the back of a slowing economy, notes Karter. “More needs to be done in terms of structural reforms and infrastructure investments for the economy to perform at its potential; the latest geopolitical issues only compound the growth challenges.” This combination of depreciation of the Russian rouble triggered by tapering, macroeconomic challenges and geopolitical tensions, led policy makers to hike base rates by 150 basis points in March 2014. Treasurers of multinationals operating locally should therefore consider the possibility of an increased cost of funding and intensified FX risk. Against this backdrop, revisiting intercompany arrangements and liquidity projects could also be extremely beneficial, points out Karter.</p>
<h3 id="liquidity-challenges">Liquidity challenges</h3>
<p>The kind of interest-rate volatility seen in Turkey, Kazakhstan, and Russia, for example, is a persistent risk for businesses engaged with emerging markets. On the other hand, investors can take advantage of these spikes as long as they have flexibility in their short-term investment approach. But, as Dimitrios Raptis, EMEA Head of Market Management, Liquidity for Citi, points out, many corporates may have funding needs in local currencies or are strategically running short positions utilising credit facilities locally. As such, rate rises will immediately impact the interest expense on their balance sheet and will inevitably imply a higher cost of doing business locally. At the same time, the devaluation of positive balances that may participate in notional pooling structures will also have an adverse impact on the total efficiency of the arrangement, diminishing the overall pooling benefit.</p>
<p>An additional common liquidity challenge for corporates expanding in emerging markets arises from the multiple banking relationships and accounts that they need to open and manage, since very few banks have a consistent geographical presence across all countries. The challenge is that these scattered pockets of cash may create fragmented positions and idle balances.</p>
<p>Another common pain point for treasurers is the level of liquidity they need to commit locally because of the lack of an easily accessible or efficient local clearing system. Fortunately though, central banks and governments in emerging markets are becoming increasingly aware of this challenge. In Russia for instance, says Karter, a number of efforts have already been made by the regulator to optimise the local payments infrastructure, starting in 2008 with the introduction of a real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) for rouble transactions. Despite these developments, however, “an MNC treasurer still would need to keep a close eye on the allocation of intraday liquidity as the majority of settlements in local currency are still done in the batch system.” This results in a transaction initiated in the morning reaching a beneficiary much later in the day. Under these circumstances, accurate forecasting and liquidity optimisation “takes on a new level of importance,” Raptis notes. However, maintaining full visibility over cash under such circumstances is difficult, if not impossible. So what is a treasurer to do?</p>
<p>As a company expands into an emerging market, and that market becomes more important to it, there comes a time when it should revisit the organisational structure of its treasury, advises Agarwal. Increasingly, for global MNCs, the combination of a centralised and regionalised structure is adopted, where the head-office is responsible for policy and the regional treasury centres enact those policies operationally. The location of regional centres is thus critical. A strong presence in emerging markets will require representation in those territories to take care of funding the business on the ground, forecasting, identifying risk exposures and co-ordinating local bank relationships.</p>
<p>Whether centralised or de-centralised, without a firm grasp of all the relevant local regulatory requirements (and indeed cultural indicators) it is not possible to devise a truly effective strategy for each location. “This is where the role of the banking partner with a long-standing physical presence in each emerging market becomes critical,” states Raptis.</p>
<h3 id="solutions">Solutions</h3>
<p>Even in a fully-centralised treasury environment, the near-constant state of market and political flux in certain countries demands strong local cash and liquidity management. Full cash visibility and the capacity to consolidate and fully fund in-country (local currency flows) are essential, but if a treasurer is able to move liquidity it should be incorporated into the company’s regional or global liquidity pools. Of course, where exchange controls are in place, technological capabilities can be limited by regulatory requirements and would eventually force the implementation of local or hybrid solutions.</p>
<p>One such option here is to centralise liquidity locally with a large international bank. “Companies tend to operate with various local banking partners, because some local needs can only be met by these providers,” says Karter. “From a risk management and liquidity perspective, using proprietary bank liquidity management tools enables companies to centralise liquidity on an overnight basis with their relationship bank in that country.” Treasurers should also consider domestic cash pools, where permissible, and look at interest-optimisation techniques. In respect of the latter, a number of banks, including Citi, offer quasi cash-pooling options that benefit grossed long and short balances (a true notional pool enables balance-sheet netting which is not permitted in many emerging market jurisdictions).</p>
<p>Where notional pooling is allowed and trapped cash is not an issue, corporates should be looking for a multi-layer, cross border concentration structure integrated with regional pooling mechanisms that are scalable and can support the organisation’s growth plans. This means that the solutions should be able to include as many currencies as possible and entities incorporated in as many jurisdictions as possible, Raptis advises. By incorporating surplus balances of emerging markets’ currencies into a notional pool it could enable the pooling owner to capitalise on the interest increases and effectively offset overdrafts in low yield hard currencies. However, he explains, this model must be delivered by the bank as a “fully integrated end-to-end solution” able to incorporate elements such as local AR/AP, short-term investments and any third party banks and also consolidate visibility from different locations and for different pockets of balances. A key parameter is the customisation of the integrated investment solution that should optimise treasurers’ excess liquidity without the need to go longer on tenors. Such a solution will minimise the risk for the corporate and will enable them to capitalise on interest rates spikes.</p>
<h3 id="structural-considerations">Structural considerations</h3>
<p>There are certain structural solutions that can also help to optimise emerging market liquidity, notes Agarwal. Where transferring liquidity between subsidiaries can potentially trap cash, establishing a netting centre can help by accelerating or delaying the transaction as appropriate, alleviating the volume of trapped cash. Similarly, if a business with a manufacturing entity in a country with currency restrictions procures significant volumes of material from suppliers in developed markets, it may create a procurement centre in a developed-market location. This enables payment acceleration coming out of the manufacturer and slower payment to the suppliers.</p>
<p>However, if the supplier is located in a ‘trapped-cash’ country, it may benefit the buyer to pay more quickly. By offering shortened payment terms, it may be possible to negotiate lower procurement costs, explains Agarwal. The reverse of this is to offer longer-terms to buyers, potentially facilitating increased sales revenues. Alternatively, if a sales entity buys from a manufacturing entity, where both are part of the same group but located in a currency-restricted geography, a re-invoicing centre located in a developed country may be used to leverage inter-company flows.</p>
<p>These are just some of the solutions available to help treasurers manage liquidity in an emerging market context. The international banking infrastructure necessarily sits astride all cash flow movements, even if an in-house bank is in place. As a partner in the journey “towards optimised liquidity”, Agarwal believes that a major international bank “with an extensive footprint in the emerging markets” has an important role to play. Indeed, given the risks and opportunities found in these markets, arguably the role of the bank is essential.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>It seems that low interest rates are here to stay. In the wake of the global financial crisis, the central banks in a number of western economies – most notably in the US and Europe – cut short-term rates in tandem with a range of other unconventional monetary policies designed to restore liquidity to glacial credit markets by driving yields down at both the long and short ends of the curve.</p>
<p>Rates are at rock bottom across the board. In the US, the Federal Funds Rate has remained at 0.25% since the onset of the crisis, as has the benchmark interest rate in the euro, while the Bank of Japan, under the ‘Abenomics’ doctrine, have gone one step further by bringing their benchmark rate down to 0%. Even as the recessionary gloom finally begins to lift in some countries, central bankers seem in no rush to change course. Indeed, a number of economists believe that the ‘new normal’ on interest rates in the US, UK and Eurozone will not be nearly as high as it was in the decades prior to the crisis.</p>
<p>A low rate environment is very much a double-edged sword for the corporate treasurer. On the one hand, it is a great opportunity to refinance and lock in lower priced debt; we have seen no shortage of corporates taking advantage of that in the past several years. However, in the context of liquidity management, a prolonged period of low rates is less of a cause for celebration. “If you are a corporate with a lot of cash on the balance sheet then these are clearly very challenging times,” says David Morton, Asia Head of Corporate Banking at HSBC. This is because investing in such conditions is difficult for the corporate treasurer – and not only because of the increasingly elusiveness of yield. It also poses great challenges in the context of risk management.</p>
<h3 id="time-to-prepare">Time to prepare</h3>
<p>One danger that might stem from talk of a ‘new normal’ in interest rates is the complacency it could foster amongst corporate treasurers. If central banks do indeed decide to hold rates below historical averages in the years to come, corporates will be assured that any inefficiencies in their management of the working capital cycle can be papered over by their continuing access to cheap funding. But to rely on that would be a momentous mistake says Sandip Patil, Asia Head of Liquidity Management at Citi. Superimpose that with Basel III implementation in the banking industry and its impact upon credit availability, and this requires serious consideration.</p>
<p>The more sophisticated of Patil’s corporate clients recognise that now is the right time to prepare for the future, to establish good liquidity risk and control policies, to determine long-term funding needs, and to improve cash flow forecasting and working capital management. “Treasurers now have more time to plan and focus on core treasury infrastructure,” says Patel. “Given that a couple of years down the road we might be in a higher rate environment, I think this is an essential step at this juncture.”</p>
<p>For many, the low rate problem is compounded by the growing pool of cash sitting on the balance sheets of corporates across the globe. According to the estimates of the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), total cash positions held by non-financial companies range as high as $18.5 trillion globally, of which 41% is held in the Asia Pacific region. The initial focus then should be on making better use of the capital across the group, rather than on looking for higher yield. In most cases, a typical corporate with several hundred entities will have cash surpluses in some areas and deficits in others. “This is the time,” says Patil, “for them to try and figure out whether they can introduce a more centralised structure, such as a regional pooling solution, that will give them the ability to use their surpluses to fund shortages in a structured and sustainable manner.”</p>
<p>On this point, transaction banks are at least singing from the same hymn sheet. Liquidity pools are a tool that corporates should be seeing a lot of value in at the moment, Mireille Cuny, Global Head of Liquidity and Investment Solutions, Société Générale. “A global approach is increasingly important,” maintains Cuny. “That is something we are continuing to work on here at SocGen, to provide our clients with a global view of what is happening in their subsidiaries across different geographies.”</p>

<h3 id="synthetic-repatriation">Synthetic repatriation</h3>
<p>Using cash surpluses to balance shortages across the group could also have the benefit of reducing reliance on debt. After all, if companies are holding more cash on the balance sheet, why borrow to raise funds? However, a recent report by Standard &amp; Poor’s appears to indicate that the very opposite is happening at large US companies. The report quantifies that since 2010, for every $1 of cash growth among issuers that S&amp;P rates, debt increased by $3.67.</p>
<p>That may seem paradoxical at first glance, but there are two apparent reasons. Firstly, and most obviously, rates are so low right now that it is both easy and cheap to take on debt. The second reason is that most of this cash is being generated offshore. As it is often difficult to repatriate these balances, due to a combination of local regulation and domestic tax considerations, companies are instead choosing to supplement their domestic cash deficits with debt with debt issuances. It is a trend the report refers to as “synthetic repatriation”; a means for companies to deliver shareholder returns while avoiding the tax penalties for repatriating foreign earnings.</p>
<h3 id="help-from-your-banks">Help from your banks</h3>
<p>The “synthetic repatriation” phenomenon is, of course, mainly a product of US tax law. A corporate headquartered in Europe or Asia should enjoy more flexibility in the way it manages cash across the group, particularly now that China is beginning to relax its foreign exchange restrictions. Assuming that it is possible to release cash, and that there is still some liquidity left after entities have been funded, treasurers must then figure out what to do with it. At this stage, taking a more proactive approach by speaking to banking partners and finding out about products that offer better returns often pays off. Such is the current environment that any additional return may not be that substantial, but the treasurer’s prerogative, of course, is to preserve the principle, not to make a profit.</p>
<p>“There are a few basis points available for those treasurers who are a little more proactive,” says HSBC’s Morton, adding that he finds it rather surprising how many companies still keep money in “rainy day accounts” that are not actively managed. A sensible first step would be to look again at the composition of the cash on the balance sheet. There is room to be a bit more adventurous and extend maturities of deposits when it comes to so-called ‘steady cash’, evidenced, says SocGen’s Cuny, by the growing attention in term deposits of up to 12 months, witnessed by the bank in recent years. “But even with longer maturity it is still very difficult to increase the return at the moment,” she adds.</p>
<p>Since deposit facilities suitable for the investing of operational cash must come with a cash or cash equivalent classification, the options are more limited still. Nevertheless, treasurers who maintain regular dialogue with their relationship banks should be aware of the growing range of new products and solutions most global banks now offer.</p>
<p>At SocGen, for example, fidelity premiums are offered the longer cash is held in the deposit account. “It is easy to administer because it is similar to deposits, and provides the same level of liquidity as it can be stopped every month or every three months, depending how it is tuned.” The fidelity premiums mean the return on the deposit is much improved, with rates on $1 ranging between 50 and 75 basis points, relative to the rate on a typical SocGen account which is presently around the 30 bps mark. “So they can double or even triple the return they would normally expect through this scheme.”</p>
<h3 id="a-perfect-storm">A perfect storm</h3>
<p>An uncertain economic environment demands, more than ever, that treasurers spread risk by diversifying their investments. That might mean spreading deposits between a greater number of banking partners or, perhaps by using money market funds (MMFs).</p>
<p>In Europe, the past couple of years have borne witness to something approaching a perfect storm for investors at the short end. The funds, which manage approximately €1 trillion in assets – mainly on behalf of corporates and institutional investors – saw net outflows almost double last year to €69.2 billion. “If you look back five years, the market then was really dominated by bank supply,” says Bea Rodriguez, Head of Portfolio Management for Cash Management at BlackRock. But that is no longer the case. Banks began to deleverage and simultaneously term out their funding to make them more sustainable. That along with their declining credit quality left a shortage of investible short-dated money market instruments.</p>
<p>The consequence of all this is less liquidity and returns so wafer-thin that investors are often in the negative after accounting for inflation. “For a treasurer that will be a big concern,” says Rodriguez. The trap for the treasurer is that, in this environment, the incentive to stretch for yield is very strong, she explains. “The danger, of course, is that in most cases it will mean a drop in credit quality.”</p>
<p>For asset managers, the challenge is to develop liquidity funds that are able to provide their corporate clients with a incremental return without adding material risk. As a result of this endeavour, a mass of new products have arrived on the market in recent years, such as BlackRock’s Euro Assets Liquidity Fund. The fund was launched on to the market in 2013. The rationale was to move away from the requirements imposed by ratings agencies on AAA-rated MMFs. It gives the fund the freedom to go longer on investments they believe offer value and have less invested in near yield-less government securities.</p>
<p>But for the corporate treasurer, surely the peace of mind provided by credit ratings is half the point of MMFs? Are treasurers not raising questions with Rodriguez regarding risk management? “We say to treasurers, there is nothing in our Euro Asset Liquidity fund that is not in our prime rated fund,” Rodriguez says – the only difference is in the way the fund is weighted. “The biggest thing a treasurer needs to worry about is whether the fund is credit worthy. If you think that we are good as your prime rated fund manager then there is absolutely no reason that you should be uncomfortable with our Euro Asset Liquidity Fund offering.” Although the product might seem rather exotic to the European treasurer, similar structures have been used in some US funds for some time now. A year on since its launch, the model is now beginning to gain a foothold in Europe, surpassing the billion euro mark in March.</p>

<h3 id="what-else-is-there">What else is there?</h3>
<p>If the absence of yield did not present a big enough problem for the MMF industry, there is also the prospect of unwelcome regulatory changes in the coming year. Although yet to be confirmed by the respective legislatures, regulators in both the US and Europe have announced proposals that will require funds to sell and redeem shares based on variable net asset value (VNAV) rather than the constant $€£1 per share asset value determined by amortised cost accounting. “That is a very different mindset,” says Rodriguez. “Some of our more sophisticated clients are happy with that as they understand that the variability will be very low as we invest in very short-term assets. But some corporates may still be a little concerned about that and decide they want to keep the money elsewhere.”</p>
<p>The problem is that for treasurers the number of suitable homes to deposit operating cash is shrinking fast. One alternative solution that has received a lot of attention of late is separately managed accounts (SMAs). These individually managed investment accounts have been around since the 1970s, and are now receiving increasing attention in light of all the uncertainty surrounding MMFs.</p>
<p>“We’ve had more conversations around those than at any other point in time,” Rodriguez remarks. For larger corporates holding substantial amounts of excess liquidity, SMA are at least worth considering, even if one loses the full liquidity benefits of being in a fund. “You can get around the maturity mismatch that is being created if you choose a SMA because you can be bespoke, and you can really tailor the risk to meet your needs,” she adds. “If you are smart, you will also understand the mismatches that are happening in the market structurally and allow yourself to be playing in them.”</p>
<h3 id="its-good-to-talk">It’s good to talk</h3>
<p>Perhaps the overriding lesson that treasurers can derive from the above is that low rates, while problematic from a liquidity management perspective, can be countered. Often better rates on deposits can be achieved simply by proactively talking to banking partners and fund managers, and keeping up to date with new liquidity products and solutions.</p>
<p>Finally, while some experts forecast rates to remain far from their historical averages for some years to come, recent central bank announcements appear to indicate that – with the possible exception of Europe – they will begin to slowly push upwards again in the coming years. With that in mind, treasurers need to do all they can in the meantime to prepare for the future by improving, as much as possible, the way in which the group manages working capital. That, of course, is the hallmark of any forward-looking treasury.</p>

<p><em>Cross-border cash pooling solutions can help corporates to optimise their cash management structures by pooling their funds into a single liquidity basket. However, they can also prove to be an administrative headache. We explain what cross-border pooling options are widely available to treasurers and how they work.</em></p>


<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>A cross-border or multi-country cash pool is a cash management structure that allows a business to concentrate the cash it holds in different countries, across separate bank accounts, in one location. This technique provides corporates with an effective way of interest optimisation and improved liquidity management as excess balances from one subsidiary can be used to offset debit balances in another. A cross-border cash pool can be a physical, notional or hybrid structure, depending on the jurisdictions covered and the legal requirements therein.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this article, we are using a definition of pooling that includes both sweeping and notional pooling. This may differ slightly from the definitions used by some cash management banks who prefer to classify sweeping structures, including zero balance account and target balancing structures as cash concentration rather than pooling. When establishing a cross-border cash pooling structure, the first choice that the treasurer has to make is whether to opt for pooling per legal entity or pooling per country.</p>
<h3 id="pooling-per-legal-entity">Pooling per legal entity</h3>
<p>When a subsidiary maintains multiple bank accounts in different currencies and countries, pooling the bank balances in each country on a legal entity basis can offer benefits to the group treasury. Cross-border sweeps are delivered to a pool in one country – concentrating all the subsidiary’s cash into a single position and providing much sought after visibility over all accounts. From this position, the net balance is swept to a master account in a central cash pool on either a notional or zero balance basis.</p>
<h3 id="pooling-per-country">Pooling per country</h3>
<p>If the decision is made to set up pooling per country, cash pools set up in the participating countries will see the various subsidiaries’ bank account balances swept to a master account in each country. These master account balances are then swept cross-border into a central pool in the main country of operation.</p>

<h3 id="multi-bank-cross-border-solutions">Multi-bank cross-border solutions</h3>
<p>Cross-border pooling solutions can also be categorised according to whether multiple local banks are used in each country, or a single network that covers the region (or indeed the world) is employed. Using local banks in each individual country may be advantageous if the corporate operates in a relatively small number of countries, especially if it requires highly specific local expertise and services.</p>
<p>Using a larger regional network bank offers the advantages of harmonised services and documentation, and the possibility to execute true end-of-day-based cross-border zero balancing. In order for a regional network bank to be a viable option, it must have branches or operating subsidiaries operating in all the countries in which the corporate is active.</p>
<p>It is sometimes possible to implement a hybrid solution, whereby domestic banks provide local services, such as payments and collections, whereas a larger regional bank provides cash pooling services. With these hybrid solutions, balances held with local banks are often concentrated to a central treasury account held with the pooling bank.</p>
<p>Certain banks even offer multi-bank sweeping services that automatically transfer balances between local bank accounts and the main cash management bank. Using SWIFT messages, the cash management bank monitors the sub-account balances at the local banks, before sending a transfer request to transfer the funds to the master account. The receiving local bank then executes a payment instruction that transfers the money to the cash management bank.</p>
<p>Since cross-border multi-bank sweeps go through the correspondent banking process, the sweeps usually happen before the end of the business day, and it is often impossible to achieve a zero balance using this setup. However, it can be possible to achieve a zero balance through multi-bank sweeping in cases where banks develop collaborative solutions.</p>

<h3 id="cross-border-zero-balancing">Cross-border zero balancing</h3>
<p>When the corporate has established the main country of operation they wish to use for cross-border zero balancing structure, they then need to set up bank accounts with the concentration bank in this country. The focus for all liquidity in the structure is on a single master account in this country. Depending on factors such as the scope of operations and the type of business that the corporate operates in, the corporate will have to weigh up the benefits of potential locations, as well as carrying out a thorough evaluation of the tax and legal issues that may exist in the potential locations.</p>
<p>There are a variety of ways in which a cross-border zero balancing sweeping arrangement can be set up:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Cross-border zero balancing by legal entity</h5>
<p>Automatic sweeps from the subsidiaries’ bank accounts in the different country branches of the concentration bank go directly to the master account at the central pooling location. Should the subsidiary have multiple bank accounts in the same country, the balances need to be consolidated or netted on to one account before this process, to limit the cross-border sweeps to one per country. If a corporate uses cross-border zero balancing by legal entity, they need to be aware of the tax issues that can arise from cross-border inter-company loans being created between the master account holder and the operating companies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Cross-border zero balancing with domestic zero balancing</h5>
<p>If the corporate has a number of subsidiaries in each participating country, a two-step process can reduce the number of cross-border transfers involved in the sweeping arrangement. In this case, the master account holder would open a non-resident bank account, or target account, with the concentration bank in each participating country. The purpose of this is to enable cash concentration to take place on a domestic basis within each country first, prior to a second cross-border zero balancing sweep arrangement from the target account in each country to the master account held in the final pooling location. Once again, cross-border inter-company loans are generated by cross-border zero balancing with domestic zero balancing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Cross-border zero balancing with domestic notional pooling</h5>
<p>In this set up, the subsidiary balances are notionally pooled in each country first. The cross-border transfer is made from a master account in each of the domestic notional pools to the master account in the central pool location, taking the balance of each country’s notional pool to zero.</p>
<p>Not every bank offers notional pooling, so the corporate will need to ensure this is possible with their preferred bank before proceeding. In most cases, the group treasury is the master account holder in the zero balance pool in each country, as well as at the central pool location. This solution allows local subsidiaries to maintain ownership of their cash balances and negates the need for inter-company loans.</p>
<p>The one exception to this rule is if any inter-company loans arise between the master account holders of the domestic cash pools and the central master account holder. The only way that this could happen is if the master account holder in the zero balance pool in each country is different from the master account holder in the central pool location.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="variation-on-a-theme">Variation on a theme</h3>
<p>Banks often adapt their cross-border zero balancing solutions to meet the particular needs of the company. Beyond a plain vanilla ZBA, there are also several variations on the end-of-day sweeping theme:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Constant balancing</h5>
<p>Constant balancing operates on exactly the same principle as zero balancing, but a residual amount is maintained in the sub-accounts as opposed to a balance of zero. The advantage to sub-account holders of this method is that a balance is immediately available at the start of the trading day to action payments, and interest is accrued on the sub-accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Target balancing</h5>
<p>Target balancing differs from plain vanilla ZBAs in that transfers are made from the master account to the sub-accounts in the opposite direction to which the zero balancing transfers were sent, so the sub-accounts keep a target balance. As the target transfers have a book date of ‘today’ but a value date of ‘tomorrow’, the sub-accounts always have a credit book balance but a zero value balance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Trigger balancing</h5>
<p>Trigger balancing is when upper and lower amounts are set on sub-accounts. Balances that exceed these amounts trigger the zero balancing process to take place, but only on those sub-accounts that meet the limits (these limits may vary for each sub-account). Trigger balancing can eliminate the need to sweep insignificant balances and lower the number of sweeps that take place, which in turn can reduce banking costs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some banks also offer the possibility to execute zero-balance sweeps at intervals other than the standard end-of-day frequency. This may benefit companies when activity on certain sub-accounts is low during certain periods of the month or year.</p>
<h3 id="cross-border-notional-pooling">Cross-border notional pooling</h3>
<p>A cross-border notional pool allows corporates to optimise interest across a number of accounts in a variety of countries. In this case, the debit and credit balances of the participating accounts in each separate country are pooled for interest purposes. This may or may not involve cross-border transfers.</p>
<p>Structuring notional cash pools on a cross-border basis can be difficult, due to the cross-guarantees required. This is one of the reasons why some banks that offer domestic notional pooling may not also offer cross-border notional pooling. Once again, cross-border tax and legal issues must also be taken into account by the corporate if they are to achieve full set-off. Some of the variations that corporates should be aware of from banks that offer this structure include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some banks may only arrange cross-border notional pools in major currencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some banks will only arrange cross-border interest compensation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some banks may insist that the funds must first be physically transferred to one account in each pooling location before the accounts are notionally pooled cross-border.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible that the bank may offer a cross-border notional cash pool without any transfers of the liquidity balances being required. With no transfers, there is no single location for this type of cash pool. The bank simply calculates the interest differently or arranges rebates to reflect the credit and debit balances that are being maintained.</p>
<p>Once it is established that a cross-border notional cash pool is the corporate’s preferred option, and their chosen bank can provide this in the countries required, an assessment of the structure being offered is required by the treasury to establish whether it meets business requirements of the organisation. Some of the main structures for cross-border notional pooling are outlined as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Cross-border notional pooling with domestic zero balancing by country</h5>
<p>In this structure, a domestic zero balancing cash pool is set up in each participating country. The balances on the master accounts for each of the domestic zero balancing country pools are then swept cross-border to accounts in the same name in the central notional pool. Sweeps can be two-way or one-way, depending on the treasury’s requirements. The country accounts in the central pool are notionally pooled for interest purposes. Using this structure, inter-company loans can be created in country, but not cross-border.</p>
<p>If the master account holders in the domestic pools are local subsidiaries, this type of structure can be very useful. Ultimate control of the notional pool master account will most likely lie with group treasury.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Cross-border notional pooling with cross-border zero balancing by legal entity</h5>
<p>Unlike the first option above, this structure negates the need for a domestic cash pool to be established, as cross-border sweeps are made on a legal entity basis. Within the cross-border notional pool, separate accounts are opened for each subsidiary using the structure. Sweeps are set up from all accounts held by the subsidiary in every country directly to its notional pool account in the ultimate pooling location. In some circumstances, the subsidiary may have multiple bank accounts in any one country. In this case, it can be beneficial to zero balance on a legal entity basis within the country first.</p>
<p>Cross-border notional pooling with cross-border zero balancing by legal entity ensures that there is no co-mingling of funds between subsidiary balances. The subsidiaries themselves retain control of their operating accounts, while their balances are simultaneously used to improve the group’s interest charge. Should the subsidiaries require funding at the local level, the two-way zero balancing sweeps also enable them to be funded indirectly by the master account holder in the cross-border notional pool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Cross-border notional pooling with domestic notional pooling</h5>
<p>In-country notional cash pools are established for each country that the corporate requires in this structure. The master account holder for each of these then arranges transfers to an account in their own name that resides in the cross-border notional pool in the main pooling location. These accounts are then notionally pooled. The main benefit of this structure is found on the legal side, as the amount of participating accounts in the cross-border notional pool is streamlined.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="restrictions">Restrictions</h3>
<p>The wide variety of liquidity management structures that exist offer the treasurer the opportunity to gain full visibility over their end-to-end cash flows and positions. More than that, they also then allow the treasurer to make their corporate cash work harder for the business. It is also important for the treasurer to be fully aware of the legal and tax requirements of the structure they choose to implement, and they should pay particular attention to any regional or national legislative restrictions.</p>

<p>Gordon Rodrigues is an Investment Director in the Asian fixed income team and is also the Head of Liquidity Asia. Rodrigues has been working in the industry since 1992. He joined HSBC Global Markets, India in 1994 as a treasury sales specialist covering corporate and institutional clients. He traded credit products on the fixed income trading desk from 1998-2002. He moved to HSBC Asset Management India in 2002 to set up the fixed income investment team and headed the team until 2007 before relocating to Hong Kong. Prior to joining HSBC, Rodrigues worked as a foreign exchange and fixed income dealer at Merwanjee Securities in Mumbai. He holds a Bachelor’s degree in Electronics Engineering and a Master’s degree in Finance, both from the University of Mumbai, India.</p>

<p>From the outset it should be known that the liquid funds industry in India is well-established. New asset managers launching in the country will typically offer a liquid fund as their ‘access point’ to other asset classes. India’s success in this sector can in part be attributed to the fact that it is well-regulated, with the Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) continuously monitoring and responding to activities in the segment. The market size as of January 2014 is approximately $40 billion, around 35% of the total mutual fund market size. Over the last five years the liquid funds segment has grown at an annual rate of 15% (source: The Association of Mutual Funds of India, AMFI). The market is 90% composed of institutional investors, eg large and medium corporates, multinational corporations (MNCs), financial institutions and banks, for which it clearly remains an attractive proposition. Whilst the economic growth rate of India has slowed in the last 24 months, it is a broad-based economy and with more investors continuing to enter the liquid funds market at the corporate and institutional level, the sector looks relatively healthy.</p>
<h3 id="liquid-funds-as-an-asset-class">Liquid funds as an asset class</h3>
<p>Liquid funds in India provide daily liquidity whereas the bank deposit structure imposes a seven-day minimum placement; there is no concept of overnight deposits in India. In addition, yields from liquid funds are typically higher than seven-day deposits. However, investors should note that the risks associated with liquid funds may be different from bank deposits. “You have access to professional credit management, transparency and efficiency and you have a higher yield and daily liquidity; these are interesting parameters in themselves,” notes Gordon Rodrigues, Investment Director, Fixed Income and Head of Liquidity, Asia, HSBC Global Asset Management (Hong Kong). But liquid funds also offer a diversified portfolio of instruments and (perhaps as importantly for corporate investors) it is “very easy to access the markets”, with bank and non-bank online trading portals and cash sweeping facilities in conjunction with mutual funds readily available.</p>
<h3 id="tax-status">Tax status</h3>
<p>For investments in liquid fund, short-term capital gains tax (currently 30%, assuming the investor falls into the highest tax bracket) is applicable on investments held for less than a year in the accumulating or growth option. It would be the same as that applicable to a bank deposit. If the dividend payout option is chosen, dividend distribution tax at 25/30%<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> (plus surcharge and cess) is paid by the liquid fund before distributing dividend to the investors. If investments are held for more than a year, it attracts long-term capital gains tax. Long-term capital gains tax is currently applied at a rate of 10% without indexation or 20% with indexation (eg cost of the investment is indexed to the Indian government’s annual Inflation Index). Investing in a product that spans three financial years (eg starting 25<sup>th</sup> March 2014 and ending 5<sup>th</sup> April 2015) gives investors a ‘double-indexation’ benefit.</p>
<h3 id="ratings">Ratings</h3>
<p>It is a benefit too that all liquid funds necessarily have the highest rating from the domestic Indian operations of global ratings agencies, Moodys (ICRA) and S&amp;P (CRISIL). CRISIL’s high-point is AAAmfs to ICRA’s A1+mfs; there is no appetite for lower-rated funds. In order to distinguish between funds providers such as CRISIL publish fund rankings in which individual funds are placed in order of merit using a weighted system based on two key parameters: a quantitative assessment linked to returns, and a qualitative assessment of asset quality, liquidity and investment concentrations. These are dynamically ranked CPR 1-5 (1 being the highest) and are reviewed quarterly. This provides corporate treasurers with another independent source for reviewing fund quality and returns.</p>
<h3 id="regulatory-environment">Regulatory environment</h3>
<p>The Indian liquid fund environment has been based on variable net asset valuation (VNAV) from the start. Funds have to mark-to-market (or fair value) assets beyond a certain tenor with amortised cost for assets below that tenor unless a traded price is available which creates volatility as the price alters. The maturity cut-off beyond which assets are marked-to-market has progressively been reduced from six months to 91 days to 60 days currently. The alternative (used by most Money Market Funds (MMFs) in the US and UK, for example) is constant net asset value (CNAV) which uses amortised cost accounting to value all assets. In Q4 2008 India saw interest rates on a sharp upwards trend with the banking system in a “deficit liquidity scenario”. This, combined with the global financial crisis, led to concerns on liquid funds credit and liquidity risk which saw a group of international and local institutional investors pull out of the market. Although far from causing a run on funds, institutional investor concerns did trigger redemptions.</p>
<p>“In an illiquid market it forced some asset managers to step in and support their own funds so as not to show negative returns in a VNAV environment,” recalls Rodrigues. This hit the year’s profitability for those funds. The regulator started to pay close attention to the kind of risks being run in the liquid funds versus the level of liquidity they could provide. Until this point, investors in Indian liquid funds could buy instruments of up to one year’s tenor.</p>
<p>Following regulatory intervention in 2009, the longest maturity that could be purchased for an Indian liquid fund was shortened from one year to 91 days, one of the few jurisdictions in the world to take such a precautionary action. In 2012 the regulator started requiring all instruments of over 60 days maturity to be marked-to-market, every single day whether traded or not; previously they could be accounted for on an amortised cost basis.</p>
<p>A daily security level valuation alongside a credit pricing matrix is provided by both CRISIL and ICRA to value all 60+ days credit papers, but when this ruling came into being, the extra volatility generated in portfolios saw asset managers automatically dropping their weighted average maturities closer to 50 days. “In the global context, if an investor wants less volatility in a VNAV environment where it has fairly volatile short rates – and short rates in the Indian and emerging market context can be more volatile than in a European or US context – this essentially means that they might have to run significantly lower-maturity instruments,” says Rodrigues.</p>
<h3 id="macro-economic-events">Macro-economic events</h3>
<p>In spite of all of the Indian regulator’s actions, in July 2013 the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recalibrated its Marginal Standing Facility (the rate at which a bank can borrow on a clean basis) to be 300 basis points above the policy repo rate. This action was seen as an interest rate-led defence against depreciation of the Indian rupee (INR). In the belief that the US would start tapering its quantitative easing programme, pressure had been put on emerging market currencies as they were sold by investors returning to USD (despite the relatively promising economic fundamentals of countries such as India). The INR came under pressure as one of a number of EM currencies facing current account deficits; the RBI’s decisive action was taken to restore stability to the foreign exchange market.</p>
<p>With a 300-basis point hike, even an investor with 60 days or less of weighted average maturity in its cash fund was going to see a negative NAV, explains Rodrigues. Mutual fund providers under the aegis of the Association of Mutual Funds of India (AMFI) agreed that the effect of US monetary policy could not have been anticipated and it was decided that the mutual fund management industry could pass on to investors the negative returns it had been seeing – the first time this has ever happened. It is a classic example of interest-rate risk but this time investors did not panic and those that remained invested for a week or more recovered to a position of net positive return. “This time they understood what was happening,” he says. “There was a lot more mature communication from asset managers to their clients in explaining the reality of the product.”</p>
<p>Corporate treasurers and institutional investors were forced to consider their reaction in context of their individual investment policies and how they should view their portfolio going forward. Rodrigues believes the industry has in fact “come out stronger from this entire experience”, knowing that it can quickly rebalance itself even in the wake of significant macro-economic events.</p>
<h3 id="investment-options">Investment options</h3>
<p>For corporate treasurers, the biggest advantage in terms of optimising returns on cash will be attainable if they have the ability to tranche that cash, explains Rodrigues. Under this model, normally cash is split three ways; “working capital” (on-demand cash), “core cash” (held in the medium term for a specific reason such as a dividend payment) and “strategic cash” (the long-term ‘war chest’).</p>
<p>Medium-term core cash options in India include fixed maturity plans (FMP). “These are closed-end products run by asset managers invested in a combination of debt securities and money market instruments,” explains Rodrigues. The securities cannot be greater in maturity than the stated tenor of the FMP, another 2009 ruling intent on avoiding interest rate mismatch between assets and liabilities and ensuring all obligations can be met. FMPs are “an established and robust market” with usual maturities being three months, six months, one year, two years and three years, the bulk being six months and one year. “Specifically in the one-year segment investors get very good tax-adjusted returns,” he notes. Investments of this type also help to maintain a diversified portfolio and, as a ‘hold-to-maturity’ product, can insulate against interest rate risk. As passively managed products the pricing attracts lower fees too, adds Rodrigues.</p>
<p>In terms of longer-term strategic cash the Indian market offers a segment known as ultra-short bond funds. These are often split two ways, with a weighted average maturity of two and five months for the conservative option or as a “more aggressive” version running between five and 12 months. The yield differential between these two could be as much as 50 basis points.</p>
<h3 id="outlook">Outlook</h3>
<p>The RBI’s focus on containing inflationary expectations is expected to continue. The RBI repurchase (repo) rate – the rate at which banks borrow in the overnight market from the RBI – is now hovering around an anti-inflationary 8%. “In the short term we expect that rate to remain relatively stable if still on the high side” says Rodrigues. Although the central bank is looking to be more “pro-growth”, he feels that during 2014, short-term funding rates are likely to range somewhere between the repo and Marginal Standing Facility rate. From an asset manager and treasurer’s point of view “it therefore makes sense to run shorter-weighted average maturities”.</p>

<h5 id="hans-peter-rupprecht-siemens-ag">Hans-Peter Rupprecht, Corporate Treasurer, Siemens AG:</h5>
<p>An in-house bank can offer treasurers the ability to improve vital processes which have increased in importance since the global financial crisis. However, before establishing an in-house bank, a number of decisions need to be made by the company to provide guidelines for the project. Within Siemens, for example, we wanted to run the financial streams of the company on a centralised basis and invest liquidity from one central department. We also decided that it would benefit the group if we could control all of our financial risk management processes centrally. Finally, we wanted 24 hour coverage over our global operations, so we looked to establish an in-house bank based in three different locations.</p>
<p>The main initial benefit which the in-house bank offered was the ability to centralise and concentrate our cash in one location. To achieve added benefits, however, we integrated the in-house bank with our company clearing systems which are used by the inter-company accounts on a worldwide basis. Following this integration, the inter-company accounts could be used for virtually all aspects of treasury – such as cash management, payment services and the settlement of FX business. The main financial benefit we gained from this was a reduction in banking fees and administrative costs as we were able to consolidate our bank accounts and conduct all inter-company payments internally. In doing so, we were able to avoid group balance sheet inconsistencies and discrepancies.</p>
<p>At Siemens AG we also wanted the treasury department to become a strategic business partner for the company and begin to place more focus on risk advisory within the company. The non-financial benefits offered by an in-house bank have helped us to achieve this by offering a greater oversight of our accounts across the group. We now have better transparency over our account balances, liquidity status, cash movements and payments transactions and have been able to standardise and automate our treasury processes worldwide, giving the treasury global control. We now also manage and control our risk centrally and can limit our counterparty risk.</p>
<p>Although the requirements and processes when establishing an in-house bank vary from company to company, there are some important areas which all treasurers will need to consider. The scope and level of centralisation is one of the key areas to determine. Tax and legal issues also need to be thoroughly investigated and documented, alongside regulatory reporting. There may also be agreements and arrangements which need to be made in advance around items such as transfer pricing. Finally, the project must be well-organised with responsibilities clearly defined amongst the group and guidelines should be distributed and followed to ensure the in-house bank is correctly established and functions as it should. Overall, an in-house bank is a very useful treasury tool and one which, in my opinion, is a must for any company with worldwide activities.</p>
<figure class="portrait left"><img alt="Portrait of Bruce Meuli" height="150" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/2014/04/2014-04-tt-02-qa-bruce-meuli-100x150.jpg" width="100"/></figure>
<h5 id="bruce-meuli-bank-of-america-merrill-lynch">Bruce Meuli, Global Business Solutions Executive for Global Transaction Services, EMEA, Bank of America Merrill Lynch:</h5>
<p>As the nature of business becomes more integrated, both horizontally and vertically, the centralisation of treasury operations is an increasingly valuable proposition and one which recent technological advancements have allowed to gather pace. In-house banks are a form of such centralisation which can offer corporates the ability to more effectively manage their cash than they would have previously within a decentralised structure.</p>
<p>The centralisation of liquidity is one of the major drivers behind the establishment of in-house banks. As the regions in which businesses operate are harmonised, the ability to centralise their liquidity becomes a more feasible business case. In doing so, corporates are able to recycle cash within the organisation more effectively as well as offer improved global oversight and yield on a risk-return basis.</p>
<p>Improved foreign exchange execution and risk management are other benefits which an in-house bank can offer. Many corporates (when establishing an in-house bank) look to include an ‘FX Centre of Excellence’ to oversee and manage all major FX transactions across the business. This leads to a reduction and consolidation of FX transactions, and also gives the treasurer greater ability to recycle cash within currencies.</p>
<p>An in-house bank can provide treasurers with better access to their financial information and data. Many other benefits can therefore be obtained, such as improved cash management and forecasting. Payment optimisation can also be improved ensuring that payments are made in the timeliest and most cost effective manner. Furthermore, working capital management becomes something which corporates can begin to assess thanks to the improved information offered by an in-house bank.</p>
<p>Bank relationships can also be enhanced as one business group is left responsible for the management of the relationship and account oversight. Furthermore, relationships can be developed with internal businesses units and the in-house bank can be used to offer added value to these through ensuring its processes help the business meet its overall objectives.</p>
<p>The implementation of an in-house bank should be seen by treasurers as a transformation project and its design should not be planned in isolation but in partnership with the overall business. Development should start at the top, with key stakeholders being considered, as treasurers will need to demonstrate to all areas of the business how the in-house bank can add value to their (specific) operations. In-house banks cannot realise their full benefit when this process is not conducted in enough depth and breadth in the initial phases.</p>
<p>The location of the in-house bank should also be carefully considered. Ideally, the bank should be located somewhere where it can provide the most value to the business for the bank to achieve its maximum benefit. However, a number of areas such as the wider business operating model, its memorandum and articles of association, current operational locations, tax and regulation must be carefully considered in the selection process. Countries which are included in the in-house banking structure also need to be considered and while many can be added there may be some which need bespoke requirements. For countries such as these it is advisable that corporates create bespoke models which sit outside the main in-house banking structure but within its function. In doing so, oversight and control can still be centrally maintained.</p>
<p>Finally, treasurers should seek to bring in partners as early as possible when looking to establish an in-house bank including core banking partners who should be challenged to provide both the banking infrastructure and consultancy expertise. Other tools and resources should also be used to ensure that the in-house bank is correctly designed and implemented and can respond to changing regulatory pressures to achieve its maximum benefit.</p>
<figure class="portrait left"><img alt="Portrait of Joerg Wiemer" height="150" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/2014/04/2014-04-tt-02-qa-joerg-wiemer-100x150.jpg" width="100"/></figure>
<h5 id="joerg-wiemer-treasury-intelligence-solutions">Joerg Wiemer, CEO, Treasury Intelligence Solutions:</h5>
<p>Treasury teams are under increasing pressure to drive down internal operational costs and to increase visibility and control. To achieve this, treasury teams need to standardise and automate their payment processes allowing them to make SMART (standardised, multibank-enabled, automated, ERP-integrated, transparent) payments and better decisions. An in-house bank has the ability to achieve 20% of this, with the other 80% coming from the replacement of multi-bank proprietary payment tools with standardised connectivity across all banks.</p>
<p>The financial benefits that an in-house bank can offer are reduced operating costs and banking fees. This is because payment traffic can be maintained within the organisation to allow companies to make payments in-house, which is cheaper than using the external banking infrastructure. This also has the benefit of making payments faster for companies. In achieving this, companies can avoid float allowing them to make the most of their cash and gain higher interest income.</p>
<p>In-house banks by themselves cannot give treasurers full control and visibility over their payment processes. However, this can be achieved when established in conjunction with the cleaning up of external payment processes, through streamlining payment processes, shutting down bank-specific payment tools and electronic payment stations, making sure you have straight through processing established and cleaning master data and bank account management. In doing this, treasurers can gain more visibility and control over their payments which will allow them to become a thought leader and business partner, providing information to allow the Board to make better decisions.</p>
<p>Although in-house banks can offer the opportunity to consolidate the amount of banking partners a company has, we have found with our clients there is often little consolidation because these banks are still used to diversifying risk. An in-house bank therefore should be considered as another banking option and one which can complement your existing banking landscape.</p>
<p>In my experience, when looking to establish an in-house bank it is best to set up a project team which incorporates many areas of the business. It is vital that you include your tax team in the business as they will ensure that transfer pricing is adequate and help to find the best location regarding tax implications. Furthermore the accounting team, shared service team and human resources team should also be included in the project as these functions run payment process, which would benefit by being automated and streamlined.</p>
<p>When setting out on in-house bank projects a lot of treasury professionals focus primarily on their own project with the ambition just to clean up treasury payment processes. This only makes up a small portion of the payments a company makes. To achieve maximum benefit I therefore suggest that treasurers team up with their colleagues and streamline and standardise company-wide.</p>
<p>Overall, my recommendation would be to start with the standardisation and automation of payment processes and then establish an in-house bank to achieve the added value from this.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>When the market place is squeezed, the level of competition amongst businesses is ratcheted up to even greater intensity. The creative energies in a company have to deliver the right goods or services, the sales people have to pull out all the stops, and production has to seek ever greater efficiencies. But it all comes to nothing unless the financial team, and particularly the treasury, take their game to a new level too because if the business runs out of money – even if on paper it is making a profit – it is the end of the game. Nowhere is this more evident than in the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) community and the mid-market enterprises (MMEs), where capital buffers are often less well established and the market for funding is tight, if it is available at all.</p>
<p>Cash management, and in particular the efficient management of working capital, therefore can stand between success and failure for many smaller firms. Accounts receivable (AR) is the major source of working capital, which in essence is the money needed to carry out day-to-day financial operations derived from the difference between current assets and current liabilities (a major outgoing, of course, being accounts payable (AP)).</p>
<p>But proper cash management is more than just optimising the payments and collections cycle; it also demands a thorough consideration of a host of essential liquidity management processes such as forecasting, short-term investments, funding and foreign exchange (FX) management, as well as technology and regulation and taxation, and of course managing bank relationships.</p>
<h3 id="the-ar-challenge">The AR challenge</h3>
<p>Forty-one percent of firms surveyed in a recent American Express Global Corporate Payments survey said that their customers often pay late. “Clearly, this has a significant impact on cash flow and a company’s ability to effectively manage its working capital, as well, of course, as having a detrimental impact on an organisation’s relationship with impacted suppliers,” says Brendan Walsh, Senior Vice President (SVP), American Express Global Corporate Payments Europe. “Many businesses are using a combination of payment solutions and tools to try and improve their cash flow – from working capital loans to customer discounts for early payment.” However, he claims, when implemented, a number of these can be detrimental to the supplier, eroding the value of the payment considerably.</p>
<p>His suggestion, naturally, is to implement a card programme, where companies are essentially outsourcing the payment dimension of their supplier relationship. Beyond the obvious bias, Walsh makes the valid point that such an arrangement can help smaller businesses because the card company processes payments with the supplier, typically making payments after five days, “which of course is far earlier than payment via the traditional invoice system that typically sees suppliers paid at any time between 30 and 90 days”.</p>
<p>Walsh further points out that SMEs should be thinking about how they manage and forecast expenses in order to gain full visibility of where company cash is going. “Detailed reporting makes forecasting easier and helps businesses to see where costs can be consolidated, putting them in a far stronger position to negotiate with key suppliers,” he states. In addition, it enables companies to identify negative trends quickly, enabling them to take corrective action and ultimately free up funds.</p>
<h3 id="a-shining-example">A shining example</h3>
<p>For a smaller business to survive let alone thrive in this economy, it is clear that it needs a set of well-defined cash management processes. Some smaller corporates excel at this. Hollister Incorporated, an independently-owned US-based global company that develops, manufactures and markets healthcare products for sale across 90 countries, is a prime example.</p>
<p>Sheila Johnson, Vice President and Treasurer, classifies the company as “middle-market sized”. Even so, according to a highly experienced client manager at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofAML), “Hollister’s treasury operation is the most disciplined I have ever seen – anywhere.” It is some claim, but Johnson and her team were Highly Commended in the Best MME/SME Treasury Solution category of the 2013 Treasury Today Adam Smith Awards.</p>
<p>So, do the pressures of managing cash differ for a player in SME/MME space from those of a larger business? “I would expect some of the considerations to be the same across companies of all sizes,” says Johnson. “Potential differences could exist in how companies raise capital through public markets, bank credit facilities or through internal funding,” she notes, but adds that the Hollister treasury goal is traditional in that it seeks to provide confidence to the Board and enable the company to implement its investment strategy. “We have business cycles that require differing levels of liquidity. We also need to consider the location of cash and the funding requirement to determine if repatriation is required.”</p>
<p>To facilitate this, cash flow and forecasting has always had a disciplined planning process in Hollister. But over the past few years the treasury team has focused on enhancing these aspects; this is where the company may mark out the difference between itself and other smaller and mid-market players. The fact that the current economic crisis has not deflected Hollister from its goal certainly indicates treasury’s resolve.</p>
<p>“We have maintained similar investment objectives and practices for many years,” states Johnson. “But the emphasis over the past five years has been to gain visibility of and access to all cash, globally.” This required the firm to allocate staff to build a global banking platform. Treasury has consolidated its banking partners and by doing so Johnson says it has been able to improve the quality of relationships and the service provided to it. It has also created an inter-company netting process and established notional pooling structures for euro and sterling transactions. The goal is clear: from a cash perspective, the team is aiming for 100% visibility; today it is already well above 90%.</p>
<p>On the P&amp;L side, it has implemented SAP’s Business Objects business intelligence system for planning and consolidation, with the Oracle Hyperion Strategic Finance tool providing a seamless interface with P&amp;L input. “We leverage our SAP Treasury platform as the hub of our treasury technology platform,” says Johnson. The company links global banking, FX trading and netting platforms to SAP Treasury to streamline processing “as much as possible”.</p>
<p>“Managing working capital is an important initiative for our company,” states Johnson. “Treasury takes a leadership role in managing the working capital committee and utilising working capital levers to benefit the company’s liquidity position.”</p>
<h3 id="preparing-the-ground">Preparing the ground</h3>
<p>Getting to this state of preparedness is no accident and Lothar Meenen, Deutsche Bank’s Head of Trade Finance/Cash Management Corporates for Germany, has seen at close quarters how cash management skills within smaller businesses can draw a line between success and failure. “SMEs in many cases do not have the opportunity like the large corporates, to maintain state-of-the-art treasury centres or outsourced shared service centres (SSCs),” he says. Without the economies of scale or the complex technological infrastructure, these businesses may struggle to follow the same path as their blue chip counterparts.</p>
<p>In addition, many smaller firms will not necessarily have the broad sweep of internal cash management skills to be able to exercise financial control. As such, Stuart Bailey, Head of Products for SMEs at Lloyds Bank, notes that the core concerns of the smaller business will typically be “simplicity, transparency and timeliness”. This, he says, often leads to a call for help to the banking community.</p>
<p>Of course, selecting the right banking partner thus becomes ever more important for the SME. When in selection mode, the process is quite different from that of the large corporate. The latter will often look to multiple banks to provide the balance sheet before deciding what proportion of its total wallet it will assign to its final panel. For the SME, it is more about assessing if a bank has the right product set and whether it will be a reliable partner because this sector is often looking for a provider with a “comprehensive proposition”, says Bailey “in terms of the relationship, provision of credit and core banking services”.</p>
<p>There is a high degree of trust required in the relationship and this, he adds, must be demonstrated through the strength and quality of the bank/client relationship where the bank will support the client through its lifecycle, not just on a moment-by-moment approach. There must also be “absolute clarity” of communication, especially around billing, the return achieved on credit balances and the cost of funding. It is, he stresses, “incumbent upon banks to ensure the client understands the value that we are providing”.</p>
<h3 id="simplicity-speed-service-but-not-always-cost">Simplicity, speed, service but not always cost</h3>
<p>The expectation might be that smaller businesses are driven almost entirely by cost. Meenen argues that whilst pricing is often a concern for large and multinational corporates it is not necessarily the case for SMEs. “Of course, they do look at price but I do not see the kind of cost pressure in the market we see from the larger companies.” Whilst SMEs are clearly not going to tolerate being over-charged, often they want flat fees because predictability assists with their forecasting and planning.</p>
<p>That said, Meenen believes large banks understand charging per-transaction can add up to a very expensive way of operating. If a smaller company can provide meaningful business across its total banking requirement, fee-structures can be reassessed especially, he notes, as parts of the SME sector are now looking increasingly attractive to some major institutions.</p>
<p>Another critical aspect, according to Bailey, is service; not just the skill and judgement of the relationship manager in offering the right products and services at the right time but also how well the bank steps up when additional services are required to support day-to-day banking and of course the ease with which contact with the right person can be made at any time. As well as being extremely service-demanding in terms of timeliness of delivery and individual attention, Nick Diamond, Head of Cash and Payment Sales, Commercial Banking, Lloyds Bank, believes the smaller corporate ultimately displays sensitivity to value.</p>
<h3 id="technology-and-consultancy">Technology and consultancy</h3>
<p>Corporates often use their banks in an advisory capacity, especially where internal resources are not available to manage long-term projects. Nowhere is this better illustrated than with the migration to the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). In Germany, for example, the Bundesbank requires its banking system to provide the SEPA format not just for cross-border payments, but for every payment. It is a major programme, but many SMEs are not at the right stage of preparation for the deadline; they have no project teams and no deep understanding, says Meenen. Deutsche Bank has carried out an in-depth study of its client base and most say they will be ready, with perhaps 10% opting to use third-party SEPA conversion services (Equens, Experian or CGI, for example) to avoid a breakdown in their payments flows. However, at a broader level of SEPA implementation, whether the wider community of corporate counterparties will be ready is another matter and this is why many institutions have rallied round their customers, establishing lobby groups and informal networks to share information.</p>
<p>SEPA is just one aspect of technology and banks and vendors can offer a range of sophisticated cash management tools. The main consideration for the SME is to understand what is the most appropriate technology at a given time and then to manage this through the growth cycle of the business. If, for example, a company is at a point where it is trading internationally, it may be easier to manage this through one domestic account. But if the exchange rates offered are not favourable, it may find it more prudent to set up a complementary series of local accounts and use the structured trade finance services of its bank (as well as its core working capital facilities). This means that the systems, architecture and services offered must be configurable and scalable to meet the changing needs of the client. It must also be proportionate to need – a cross-border pooling structure may be overkill. To this end, comments Meenen, “a bank needs to be honest and make that differentiation between what it can and cannot provide”.</p>
<p>Direct access to an online banking system may be sufficient for a small business – the smaller businesses will most likely deal with just one core bank – but as operational complexity is introduced, regular contact with a bank’s relationship managers is more likely to facilitate the bank’s understanding of its client’s progressive needs and enable it to provide the right services.</p>
<p>The number of cash management personnel may increase with the size of the business but in a small company the cash manager is likely also to undertake a number of other treasury-related roles. On the surface, says Diamond, this may seem like the ideal structure to reach the heart of the company’s needs quickly and have direct access to the decision-maker. “But the challenge can sometimes be the capacity, focus and priority of that decision-maker. We may wish to talk about a specific topic but they may have conflicting priorities; whilst we have to understand the client’s agenda, in a smaller company their own management of priorities is much more difficult than in a bigger organisation.”</p>
<h3 id="desirability-of-the-sme-as-a-bank-client">Desirability of the SME as a bank client</h3>
<p>Independent research published in April 2013 by the UK’s National Institute of Economic and Social Research has found that bank finance has become more difficult for SMEs to obtain following the financial crisis and, it notes, credit “has remained relatively difficult to obtain since, compared to the period before 2008”, and rejection rates for loans and overdrafts increased after 2008 and have not dropped back yet. The report also says “economic uncertainty appears to affect bank lending to SMEs disproportionately compared to large firms”.</p>
<p>This relates to the UK only but all the same suggests that smaller businesses are not in favour with the banks. Not so, says Meenen. He argues that the appeal of the smaller corporate for a large bank is very much alive and driven by the regulatory environment. Dealing only with the major corporates, he explains, arguably could make the banks slightly less stable, at least seen through the lens of Basel III and Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) IV which seek greater diversification and stability in the funding base of banks. SMEs provide one source of diversified funding which meets with regulatory approval.</p>
<p>“There has been an interesting trade-off between lending-growth, to ease us out of recession, and the deleveraging and liquidity and cash increasing in the market,” notes Bailey who adds that it will be interesting to see how this situation will play out. The past few years may have been difficult for a lot of businesses, but as growth returns (albeit very slowly) to some markets it will bring new challenges for the smaller business. One of the main issues, he believes, will be around working capital cycles because as the smaller business seeks to expand, the greater demand for their products will require increased funding of all the elements needed to meet that demand. For the treasurer of the smaller business, it seems a finely tuned balancing act focused on maintaining working capital and bank relationships is never off the agenda.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Investors have grown accustomed to an environment of record low interest rates. However, comments from the world’s major central banks, coupled with improving economic growth expectations, suggest that investors may soon have to adapt to a changing rate environment. For those investing for the short term to meet cash management needs, ensuring preservation of capital and maintaining liquidity as interest rates rise is a key priority. An understanding of how different cash-like investments are affected by rising rates can help treasurers position their portfolios to achieve this.</p>
<h3 id="the-current-yield-constrained-environment">The current, yield-constrained environment</h3>
<p>Since the financial crisis of 2008, the world’s major central banks have, to varying degrees, pursued ultra-loose monetary policies to stimulate economic activity. The US Federal Reserve (the Fed) was the earliest advocate of this approach, taking its benchmark federal funds rate to a record low of 0-0.25% in December of 2008, where it has remained since. The Bank of England followed suit soon thereafter, in March 2009 reducing its key rate to 0.50%, while the European Central Bank has gradually cut Eurozone interest rates from 2.00% in 2009 to their current record low level of 0.50%.</p>
<p>While interest rates have languished at historic lows, the unprecedented asset-purchase programmes of the Fed, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan have served to inflate the prices of bonds, supressing yields further still. With the debt crisis in the Eurozone periphery raising concerns over a possible break-up of the currency bloc, and with developed markets in a prolonged slump, the yield on the US ten-year Treasury bond hit an all-time low just below 1.4% in July 2012. This was down from a high of nearly 15.9% in September 1981, as shown in the chart below. UK Gilt and German Bund yields have also fallen to their lowest ever levels.</p>

<p>The yield-constrained environment of the last few years has been a challenging one for liquidity investors looking to meet their short-term cash needs, particularly as inflationary pressures have served to erode returns. Conditions, however, now look to be changing and yields are picking up from their lows – since April, the interest rate on the ten-year US Treasury has risen by more than 100 basis points. Although this is likely to be a gradual process and central bank policy rates may remain on hold for some time yet, liquidity investors need to be prepared for an eventual normalisation of interest rates.</p>
<h3 id="lower-for-how-much-longer">Lower for how much longer?</h3>
<p>As the outlook for economic growth in the developed world has improved, investors are increasingly focusing on how much longer central banks will keep interest rates at record lows and when they will change the trajectory of their asset-purchase programmes. This focus by investors has already led to a significant rise in benchmark bond yields from their record lows. For the first time in many years, the broader fixed-income asset class has experienced negative returns.</p>
<p>The current era of extraordinarily low interest rates is best explained by the unprecedented actions by the Fed and other central banks in response to the financial crisis. We have already seen above how the Fed initially employed traditional monetary policy tools, lowering the federal funds target rate from 5.25% in September 2007 to a 0%-to-0.25% range in December 2008 (where it has remained since). Then, in November 2008, amid near-frozen credit markets, overnight rates close to zero and the US economy mired in the worst recession since the 1930s, the Fed embarked on a programme of quantitative easing (QE). The central bank extended the size and average maturity of their balance sheet assets through the purchase of Agency debentures, Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) and Treasuries. These actions sought to contain the financial crisis, limit its impact on the broader economy, and aid the prolonged recovery by lowering longer-term interest rates to encourage investment and consumption.</p>
<p>Roll forward to May 2013, and Fed chairman Ben Bernanke was indicating that the Fed could begin reducing its monthly asset purchases later this year if improvements in economic growth seemed sustainable. This indication was followed in June by a statement that asset purchases may end altogether in 2014. As a result, investors aggressively sold both risk assets and Treasuries, causing the yield on the ten-year Treasury to rise to over 2.60% in June, from just 1.63% at the beginning of May. Credit spreads also widened approximately 30 bps over that period (as measured by the Markit CDX North America Investment Grade index). While yields have retraced somewhat since that initial reaction, they remain higher for UST maturities longer than two years as of mid-2013. The rise in yields across the curve, from two years out, is shown in Chart 2.</p>

</figure>
<p>As the central bank has signalled, reductions in asset purchases will be the first step toward the normalisation of monetary policy (the Fed has repeatedly emphasised that this decision will be “data dependent”). Ending the QE programme would be its second step. If economic conditions warrant, the Fed’s next moves would include modification of forward guidance regarding, and the eventual raising of, the federal funds target rate.</p>
<p>Fed communications suggest that the current level of the target rate will likely remain appropriate for a considerable period of time. But as investors anticipate diminished monetary accommodation and eventual tightening by the Fed, demand for fixed income securities will fall, causing prices to drop and market interest rates to rise.</p>
<p>In Europe, monetary authorities have begun to issue forward guidance about the future direction of rates to try to stem rising bond yields in reaction to US tapering. Both the European Central Bank and the Bank of England have sought to reassure markets that rates will remain at record lows for a prolonged time so that borrowing rates remain attractive and continue to stimulate economic growth. Nevertheless, with interest rate policy having been effectively made conditional on improvements in the real economy, there remains considerable uncertainty about the actual timing of rate rises.</p>
<h3 id="allocating-cash-most-effectively-ahead-of-rising-rates">Allocating cash most effectively ahead of rising rates</h3>
<p>Given rates are at record lows and unlikely to fall much further, and with economic activity picking up in North America and in Europe too, it is safe to say that interest rates will begin to trend upwards at some point. We have seen that bond markets are already adjusting to a period of interest rate normalisation. As interest rates and yields rise, short-term cash investors will also have to adjust to ensure that capital is preserved and liquidity is maintained.</p>
<p>This is because all fixed income and short-term portfolios carry an inherent level of interest rate risk, so rising rates will have an impact on the current and future values of existing cash holdings, as well as influence the relative attractiveness of different investments for meeting specific investment needs. Investors with short-term investment horizons should therefore consider the potential effects of rising interest rates on the instruments at their disposal and adjust their exposures accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="strategies-to-insulate-a-portfolio-from-rising-rates">Strategies to insulate a portfolio from rising rates</h3>
<p>How can an investor protect a portfolio of bonds in a period of rising rates? Though some investors may choose to simply exit the asset class, there are strong arguments for maintaining a core allocation to fixed income. In most rate environments, fixed income provides diversification, a steady stream of income and a lower volatility investment over time. Additionally, fixed income portfolios with greater duration have historically provided higher returns, albeit with greater volatility, over longer time horizons. However, for investors with shorter investment horizons (especially those with potential near term cash needs), or those looking to protect profits from longer duration strategies, a key priority is to mitigate potential volatility during the anticipated rising rate period. To that end, investors should consider how they can best deploy two effective strategies for managing a rising rate environment: shortening duration and increasing income.</p>

<p>The most effective way to protect a portfolio from the impact of rising rates is to reduce its weighted average duration. In traditional fixed income portfolios, this is typically achieved using one or more of the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sales of longer dated fixed coupon securities, and/or reinvestment of interest income, into those with shorter tenors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investments in higher income or higher yielding securities, which will have shorter interest rate durations relative to bonds with the same maturity. By investing in credits with spreads over the risk free rate, more cash is received on the coupon payment dates thereby shortening the duration and increasing the cash available to be reinvested at higher rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Purchases of floating rate notes, whose interest rates reset on a regular basis. As a floater’s interest rate resets to adjust for market changes, its price should typically experience less volatility and thus it will have a lower duration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With the latter it is worth pointing out that most floating rate notes reset interest rates on a monthly or quarterly basis thus durations on these securities are typically shorter than three months. However, it is important to note that while the owners of such bonds have limited exposure to changes in interest rates, they are exposed to the creditworthiness of the borrower until the final maturity of the bond. This means that floating rate bonds, not issued by the US Treasury, can have longer spread durations than interest rate durations. This can result in greater volatility should credit conditions change.</p>
<h3 id="increasing-the-interest-income-component-of-total-return">Increasing the interest income component of total return</h3>
<p>Increased income or yield not only lowers duration but also provides greater income return helping offset declines in price in periods of rising rates. However, higher yields due to increased credit exposure do not come without added risk. Should credit spreads widen in conjunction with rising rates, these securities will under perform. Similar to interest rate duration fixed income investors must be cognizant of spread duration as well. Longer spread durations will typically be more negatively impacted by widening credit spreads.</p>
<p>Due to the risk of widening credit spreads it is important that an investor examine where credit spreads are relative to historical patterns at the beginning of a rising rate period. In recent years, extremely low levels on risk-free rates have forced investors to seek yield in riskier securities, resulting in tighter credit spreads. It is possible that as investors sell fixed income securities in anticipation of higher rates, sales will not be limited to risk-free Treasuries alone and credit product may see spreads widen.</p>
<h3 id="examples-of-short-duration-product-styles">Examples of short duration product styles</h3>
<p>As they consider the key elements of investing in a rising rate environment–shorter duration, income cushion, lower credit spread duration – investors can choose among a variety of traditional short-term fixed income products. Rising interest rates will affect different cash-like investments in different ways. Understanding how various cash investments are effected by interest rates allows investors to take action to mitigate the impact of a rising interest rate cycle. The following is a summary of the impact that investors can expect to see from rising rates on the main types of short-term investments:</p>
<h5>Overnight bank deposits:</h5>
<p>Rates tend to track rises in interest rates quite closely, although investors should be aware that, due to being exposed to a single counterparty, credit risk may be higher. Counterparty risk can be reduced through diversification, while potential returns may also be higher from a more diversified investment.</p>
<h5>Term deposits:</h5>
<p>Tend to lag shorter-dated deposits due to the need to wait out the term of the deposit before re-setting to a higher interest rate. These carry the same counterparty risk as overnight deposits, but as they are not marked-to-market, investors are not exposed to unrealised losses.</p>
<h5>Money market funds:</h5>
<p>Will see their yields rise in line with prevailing interest rates, although with a small time lag. Due to their diversified portfolios, they carry a significantly lower level of counterparty risk than overnight or term deposits. Also these are not marked-to-market, so there are no unrealised losses.</p>
<h5>Managed reserves funds:</h5>
<p>Usually have durations between 0.25 and one year, and invest primarily in higher income-generating short-term corporate securities. Due to higher durations, unrealised losses can occur when rates rise. Managed reserves funds have historically outperformed money market funds over longer time periods, as well as offering a higher yield.</p>
<h5>Short-term bond funds:</h5>
<p>Potential to earn higher yields than cash instruments, but longer duration and marked-to-market pricing means that they are more sensitive to interest rate movements. Investors may therefore experience unrealised losses, and therefore need to be certain about the accuracy of their cash flow forecasting before investing in longer duration in a rising rate environment.</p>
<h5>Separate accounts:</h5>
<p>Offer investors the flexibility to tailor portfolios so that they have the specific duration and other risk characteristics that they are comfortable with. However, separate accounts are marked-to-market, and may suffer unrealised losses as interest rates rise.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>With the right investment strategy in place, cash investors can ensure that they are best positioned to benefit when interest rates eventually begin to rise. Given that timing the market is fraught with difficulties, treasurers may benefit from a flexible approach that allows them to move cash reserves between different options to suit the prevailing interest rate environment. The first step to designing a robust cash strategy is to recognise that different short-term investments carry different yield, security and liquidity considerations through the interest rate cycle.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>When International Financial Reporting Standard 9 (IFRS 9) eventually becomes mandatory in 2015, treasurers will no longer have to apply International Accounting Standard 39 (IAS 39). But what was IAS 39 and why was it introduced in the first place? In this article, Treasury Today summarises one of the most complex accounting standards and explains why, following the recent financial crisis, calls mounted for a new standard to be introduced in its place.</p>
<p>Most companies use derivatives to mitigate or offset various financial risks such as interest, currency and commodity price risk. The objective of hedge accounting is to reflect the results of a company’s hedging activities, particularly in instances where those hedges involve the use of derivatives. This allows companies to avoid the standard accounting treatment for derivatives, thereby escaping the temporary undesired volatility in profit and loss (P&amp;L) caused by valuation and timing differences. However, at the present time, any corporate who wishes to apply hedge accounting treatment to its derivatives trades must meet the complex requirements set out in International Accounting Standard 39 (IAS 39). But what exactly does IAS 39 involve?</p>
<h3 id="setting-standards">Setting standards</h3>
<p>International standardisation of financial instrument reporting began in 1988, under the supervision of the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC). During the 1990s, the committee attempted to devise a fundamentally new approach to developing a standard. But unable to secure a consensus on measurement issues, the initial standard released in 1995 was limited solely to aspects of presentation and disclosure. This problem persisted and in 1998, as the target date for IAS 39 was fast approaching and with next to nothing on the table, the Board decided to base the new standard almost entirely on US General Accepted Accounting Principle (GAAP). The committee only ever intended this to be an interim solution, however, and as a result IAS 39 went through a number of evolutionary adjustments over the subsequent decade as the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), the IASC’s successor, attempted to develop a workable and truly international standard.</p>
<h3 id="the-final-standard">The final standard</h3>
<p>The final standard, adopted in January 2005, sets out the way in which financial instruments should be recognised and measured on a company’s balance sheet. Below is a brief summary of the main principles embedded in the standard.</p>
<p>Under IAS 39, financial instruments are defined as “any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity”.</p>
<p>One significant change was the introduction of embedded derivatives. Some contracts that do not appear to be financial instruments may have derivatives embedded in them – for example, leases which include an option to buy and debt instruments that give the option to prepay). The IAS 39 standard stipulates that any embedded derivative should be separated from its host contracts and accounted for as a distinct instrument. This treatment is the case when the economic risk and characteristics of the embedded derivative are not closely related to those of the host contract.</p>
<p>The IAS 39 standard covered three main areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Recognition and derecognition.</h5>
<p>The standard stipulates that all financial assets and financial liabilities, derivatives included, must be recognised on the balance sheet. Only when an entity is released from its primary obligation relating to that liability can it remove, or ‘derecognise’, the assets from its balance sheet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Measurement.</h5>
<p>There are categories into which financial assets must be classified: fair value through profit or loss; held to maturity; loans and receivables; and available for sale. Financial liabilities, meanwhile, can be categorised as either fair value through profit or loss, or amortised cost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Derivatives and hedge accounting.</h5>
<p>Under IAS 39, fair value must be used for the measurement of all derivatives, with gains and losses in the income statement. Derivatives, however, are often used to hedge recognised assets or liabilities. These may be recorded at amortised cost or at fair value with gains and losses recognised in equity or forecast transactions, causing a mismatch in the timing of income statement recognition. By changing the timing recognition in the income statement, hedge accounting corrects this mismatch.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The standard allowed for companies to adopt hedge accounting as long as the hedge is formally designated and documented and meets hedge effectiveness tests both prospectively and retrospectively.</p>
<p>The three types of hedge accounting permitted under IAS 39 were:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Fair value hedge.</h5>
<p>This is designed to manage the risk that there is a change in the value of an item (whether an asset or a liability) that is measured to a fair value and will have an effect on the income statement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Cash flow hedge.</h5>
<p>This is designed to manage the risk that there will be volatility in the value of future cash flows that will have an effect on the income statement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation as defined in IAS 21.</h5>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Under the latest revision to IAS 39, fair value hedge accounting can also be used for a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk. This is often known as macro hedging.</p>
<p>Finally, IAS 39 determines the circumstances in which hedge accounting must be discontinued. These include when a hedge ceases to be effective, the hedged instrument expires or is sold or exercised, and if the company stops designating the relationship as a hedge.</p>
<h3 id="impact-upon-corporates">Impact upon corporates</h3>
<p>International accounting standards, such as IAS 39, were initially developed with the objective of creating greater transparency and consistency in the way in which companies report financial instruments by unifying the various rules relating to this process.</p>
<p>But in retrospect IAS 39 clearly had the opposite effect. The standard was extremely complex and, in some places, contradictory – particularly the section which related to hedge accounting. As a consequence, many companies struggled to apply the standard correctly when reporting their derivatives trades.</p>
<p>One of these companies was Volkswagen International Finance (VWIF) who, like many others, had struggled to implement the standard in time for the January 2005 adoption deadline, which the International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) board had suddenly announced less than a year before.</p>
<p>In an article in Treasury Today back in 2008, Volkswagen explained that the challenge was complicated further when the company consulted the accounting profession for guidance and discovered that what the audit firms classified as “compliant hedge accounting solutions” varied considerably. In the end the company decided to work with its treasury management system (TMS) provider, IT2 (now part of Wall Street Systems) to develop a tailored solution, which entailed sending the exposures to VWIF from the central SAP system. The company’s TMS solution then derived the results and reported on hedge effectiveness both retrospectively and prospectively as stipulated in the standard. The solution went live the first week of December 2005 and 14 VW companies decided to use the hedge accounting reporting service.</p>
<h3 id="ifrs-9-a-fresh-start">IFRS 9: a fresh start?</h3>
<p>Following the 2008 financial crisis, IAS 39 came under heavy scrutiny. Experts claimed that IAS 39’s strict rules on fair value had contributed to the proliferation of toxic derivatives assets that nearly caused the collapse of the global financial system. In 2009, leaders of the G20 group of nations declared that financial reporting needed to improve and called upon the standard setters to reduce the complexity of the hedge accounting standard and make it less open to interpretation.</p>
<p>In response, the IASB announced that the introduction of a new set of accounting standards, IFRS 9, would be fast-tracked. A draft of requirements for hedge accounting, the third step in a tripartite group of proposals, were finally published in September 2012. Corporates wishing to use hedge accounting will have until 1<sup>st</sup> January 2015 to comply with new requirements.</p>
<p>Although IFRS 9 might prove to be less problematic than its predecessor, don’t think there won’t be more rules and room for further interpretations.</p>

		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>The shifting focus of global commerce and a changing and variable regulatory environment are driving businesses to look much closer at their liquidity and risk management processes. While many multinational organisations are currently flush with cash, they are concerned with optimising future sources of liquidity. This is forcing companies to focus on improving their approaches to be able to make use of internal funds, while optimising and controlling the deployment of excess cash. Given these dynamics, the distributed regional and currency specific liquidity structures are no longer in favour.</p>
<p>Best-in-class companies are achieving optimisation through the centralisation and globalisation of their liquidity management and account structures. But this cannot be achieved in isolation. In adopting this new liquidity strategy, businesses need to ensure that the approach to liquidity management is integrated with the accounts payable (AP) and receivable (AR) processes.</p>
<p>Historically, companies operating globally would manage their liquidity on either a regional or single currency basis (or both). The adoption of the segregated model was more a reflection of the tendency for treasury organisations to be decentralised and the lack of tools available to support a more centralised approach. This reflected not only the technological limitations of the day, but also the stage of evolution of corporate treasury in general, which after the financial crisis in 2008, assumed a more strategic role.</p>
<p>“Managing through the crisis made both the CFO and the treasurer strategically more important to company interests, especially from a risk management perspective,” says Tom Schickler, Global Head of Liquidity for HSBC’s Global Payments and Cash Management business. “And as the treasury function became more important, centralising treasury suddenly became a strategic imperative.” The desire for centralisation coincided with improvements in the banking solutions available to support their requirements.</p>
<h3 id="funding-constraints-in-the-risk-and-regulatory-environment">Funding constraints in the risk and regulatory environment</h3>
<p>Emerging from the financial crisis in 2008, heightened concerns from a risk management perspective have accelerated the trend towards globalisation of liquidity management. Companies are seeking means by which to manage their counterparty and sovereign exposure, while ensuring that they have multiple sources of liquidity (not only relying on internal sources of funds). As a consequence, companies are looking beyond visibility and control to securing access to liquidity on a real-time basis in order to be able to respond to market events.</p>
<p>Recent developments across Europe (eg. Cyprus) have reinforced the importance of being able to gain access to liquidity on a timely basis, and furthermore to set up a foundation of liquidity management that reflects the companies risk management orientation. In addition to counterparty and sovereign risk, liquidity risk has also manifested itself in the past decade as money markets have not remained liquid during certain flashpoints. The situation has been acerbated by the constrained availability of cash from banks. The gridlock in the money markets that hit Europe in 2008 and 2009 and then again in 2011 and 2012, certainly raised concerns amongst companies, leading many to focus on accessing their own cash across all of their centres.</p>
<p>But handling the risk dimension is only part of the game. The evolving banking regulatory regime poses an additional funding consideration for corporates. As the increased capital requirements of Basel III come to fruition, it will place constraints on bank balance-sheet capacity. This will increase the cost of bank borrowing for companies over the long term. On an absolute basis, with interest rates currently running low, the cost of borrowing may be perceived to be low. However, it may prove to be relatively more expensive than heading in an alternative direction such as the debt and equity capital markets, raising funds through private equity or other non-traditional lenders – a move taken by increasing numbers of corporates.</p>
<p>In response, treasurers have learnt to prioritise the need to create or at least supplement the mechanisms they use to self-fund. But if they do this, it means putting in place a sound liquidity management structure; augmentation usually means shifting from the historical regional or single currency-based approach to a global approach, which implies certain control issues.</p>
<h3 id="control-visibility-and-access">Control, visibility and access</h3>
<p>“In the past decade or so there has been an emphasis on visibility and control,” notes Schickler. “It’s one thing to have visibility but the more important issue that companies are wrestling with – and some, but not many, are actually attacking – is the element of access to cash when it is needed.” A global treasurer may have a multi-bank report stating the existence of money in multiple countries, but if a crisis hits just knowing there is money out there does not help. The need, states Schickler, is to get hold of that money immediately and be able to do something constructive with it. “It is no longer just about visibility and control; it is also now about timely and efficient access.”</p>
<p>This realisation puts a premium on globalising liquidity management, especially consolidation of accounts in unregulated and less-regulated markets and preferred domiciles, but doing so in a way that minimises cash fragmentation. “Corporations need to consolidate liquidity positions as part of their goal, but they should avoid creating inefficiencies in their accounts payable (AP) and receivable (AR) processes as a consequence of that,” warns Schickler. By shifting these functions to one country without considering precisely the value, location and timing of payments in another, funding may not now be readily available. “Corporates need an automated structure that has the ability to fund those payments on a just-in-time basis, so they reap the benefits of having consolidated their liquidity position while still being able to meet their daily payment obligations.”</p>
<p>It is clear that where consolidation has not been managed effectively, it can put pressure on the treasury and finance functions which will need to counteract the negative effects by increasing to pinpoint accuracy their cash forecasting results. “But if you integrate your liquidity management approach with your AP and AR processes on a seamless and automated basis, you can get the best of both worlds; you don’t then have that operational requirement and process or that forecasting need.”</p>
<h3 id="bank-differentiation">Bank differentiation</h3>
<p>Banks differentiate themselves not by the availability of their liquidity management technology but more on their ability to apply that technology to develop a solution that is bespoke for a particular client based on its own liquidity management priorities and that aligns with its AP and AR processes. With a combination of local cash management capability that is fully integrated with a global liquidity platform, “HSBC is uniquely positioned to connect our clients’ liquidity across developed and developing markets,” says Schickler.</p>
<h3 id="market-liberalisation">Market liberalisation</h3>
<p>Market liberalisation programmes in certain countries – and the opportunity to leverage the benefits afforded by unlocking trapped cash and improving working capital efficiency – should be a catalyst for companies to review their existing local account and liquidity management structure, urges Schickler. Getting the foundation right, to take advantage of the anticipated liberalisation, will allow a company to integrate cash into their global structure as soon as the new regulatory regimes finalise their changes.</p>
<p>Recent developments in China, for example, have seen the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) and the Chinese central bank, the Peoples’ Bank of China (PBoC), approve pilot schemes to enable cross-border sweeping of both foreign currency and renminbi (RMB). The pilot currently involves five international banks, including HSBC, and 13 large corporates, all of which have worked closely with the regulators in the design and implementation of the scheme. As the pilot progresses into broader commercial availability, a greater number of companies will be able to reduce their trapped cash in the country, notes Schickler.</p>
<p>He believes that schemes such as this are, or should be, creating a priority for companies to put the right foundation in place from a domestic cash management and liquidity management perspective, “in order to take advantage of the future capability to integrate local liquidity with the rest of their global liquidity.”</p>
<h3 id="taking-the-long-view">Taking the long view</h3>
<p>Globalisation is not something that companies can flick a switch and get done; it is an evolutionary process. Depending on where each company is in the evolution of its own treasury management processes there will be an ongoing need for consultation and revisiting existing structures. Liquidity management will never be a “fire and forget” process; it demands continuous attention. “Remember that Basel III is still in the early stages of implementation. Each jurisdiction will interpret it and impose regulations based on its own particular interests and priorities,” warns Schickler. As a consequence, there will be a continuous need to respond to those developments by prioritising and making use of different tools.</p>
<p>As the regulatory environment continues to evolve in the banking and in the corporate space, it will impact on the dynamics of areas such as the money markets and other investment options. These changes will conspire to require companies to have a foundation, from a treasury and liquidity management perspective, which gives them the flexibility to respond in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Regulations and economic drivers are rarely fully-aligned across markets and so monitoring, understanding, interpreting and responding to them is an ongoing challenge. It requires a partnership between bank and client enabling full and frank dialogue, says Schickler. The capacity for HSBC to leverage its extensive local presence and expertise is its stock in trade when it comes to making sense of these events and translating them into practicable solutions for corporate clients.</p>

<h3>Case study</h3>

<h4 class="fn">Brendan McGraw</h4>
<h5 class="title">Group Treasurer at CLSA</h5>

<p>CLSA is one of the leading and longest-running independent brokerages in Asia and one of the world’s largest agency brokers. It operates three main business activities – equity broking, asset management and investment banking.</p>
<p>Headquartered in Hong Kong and represented in 21 locations across Asia Pacific, Europe and the US, CLSA is a research-driven business with a global reach.</p>
<p>Formerly owned by Crédit Agricole CIB, 19.9% of CLSA shares were acquired by CITIC Securities International Company Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CITIC Securities Company Limited (‘CITICS’) in July 2012. The deal incorporated an agreement for the acquisition of the remaining 80.1% of CLSA through a put option. This is expected to receive regulatory approval and be completed by the end of June 2013. The deal, in total, represents a valuation of $1.25 billion. CLSA has established stand-alone brokerages in Japan and the US as part of the transaction from Crédit Agricole to CITICS</p>
<p>CLSA has enhanced its cash management solutions through diligent treasury management, the application of sound technologies and through the support of a banking partner that has made a concerted effort to work with the company.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What we really liked about HSBC was their preparedness to adapt their cash management models to fit in with what CLSA did rather than the other way round.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CLSA naturally went to market to find the most suitable partner and the quickest response came from the bank with the best solution. But the partnership it chose is not just about a set of clever IT solutions. “Technology has a role to play, but a lot of banks have similar technologies, or they can adapt them to fit,” explains CLSA’s Group Treasurer, Brendan McGraw. “What we really liked about HSBC was their preparedness to adapt their cash management models to fit in with what CLSA did rather than the other way round.”</p>
<p>By partnering with HSBC to build out the right structure for operational efficiency, CLSA has established the path of its progress, assuring itself of access to a global operational network. A key part of the relationship is the alliance of this network with the in-depth local knowledge that the bank brings; HSBC obviously has a strong presence in Asia and, in the words of McGraw, “having boots on the ground has really helped us”.</p>
<p>Over the past few years CLSA has worked with HSBC on a number of projects, all driven by a general need for greater efficiency. Not least of these is the deployment of the bank’s Integrated Payables Solution. This has enabled the centralisation and streamlining of CLSA’s accounts payable management processes. Using an HSBC-supplied adaptor to interface between the bank’s internet banking platform, HSBC<em>net</em>, and CLSA’s SAP general ledger system, most payments processes can now be executed through the firm’s Hong Kong headquarters.</p>
<p>Prior to HSBC’s involvement, CLSA’s management of cash was similarly left to the individual entities. This resulted sometimes in an imbalance between debit and credit positions across their businesses, with some entities operating with short positions and requiring funding, whilst others ran positive cash positions. McGraw presided over the implementation of a regional pooling structure for CLSA spread across nine Asian markets and based on HSBC’s Global Liquidity Solutions (‘GLS’) platform. This, he reports, has enabled CLSA to “cut its borrowing quite substantially.”</p>
<p>The regional structure features two multi-currency notional pools – one for entities inside of Hong Kong and one for those outside, this split being driven by a quest for tax efficiency. The pools are used to consolidate and offset mismatching positions across the firm’s business entities and obviate the need for individual entities long on cash to concern themselves with the demands of investing that cash. Also put in place is HSBC’s Interest Enhancement facility. This is a global cross-border virtual pooling solution that pays, as the name suggests, an enhanced interest rate on CLSA’s total operational balances. On the FX side, McGraw reports that bank and CLSA are working together on building a more efficient currency trading system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“They’ve helped us to enhance our processes by bringing more robust cash management solutions.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pre-implementation work for each project to date featured intensive “brainstorming” sessions between client and bank, each time creating a detailed requirements definition. HSBC then returned with a practical proposition, a dedicated project team and a fully-formed project management approach. The latter, although within the confines of the standard HSBC approach, notably allowed the flexibility to meet CLSA’s individual needs – each time working backwards from the planned objective and deadline to incorporate all the essential milestones and timelines.</p>
<p>The rigour of each planning stage ensured that HSBC’s solutions were able to integrate comfortably with CLSA’s existing processes and technologies. “If anything, they’ve helped us to enhance our processes by bringing more robust cash management solutions,” comments McGraw.</p>
<p>The pooling structure still requires some work before bringing all parties on board and the conversation between CLSA and HSBC is thus ongoing. The rise of the US and Japanese brokerages will likely see the growth of each entity’s own cash production and funding needs which will make them natural targets to join the cash pool. “We’ve done a very good job on this, but there are a few more steps to go,” adds McGraw. The partnership, it seems, is assured for some time to come.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Looking at liquidity requirements from a corporate perspective, there are several distinct elements, according to Ashutosh Kumar, Global Head of Corporate Cash and Trade, Transaction Banking, Standard Chartered. “Firstly, corporates simply need the liquidity for working capital purposes, so they go to a bank to borrow that liquidity. But the companies themselves generate liquidity in their day-to-day operations so they now want to look at how this can be used more efficiently. Furthermore, corporates are beginning to question why they actually need that amount of liquidity, trying to determine ways to reduce the liquidity requirement itself.</p>
<p>“There is a clear evolution there – treasurers are looking at all three aspects rather than just tapping the banking market for further liquidity. They are now having proactive conversations with their internal colleagues and banking partners to ensure that they have the appropriate liquidity profile in order to run their day-to-day operations.”</p>
<p>Some corporates may also look towards alternative finance options such as the bond market. In 2012 corporate bond issuance exceeded loan issuance, and even those corporates who do not have access to capital markets are monitoring the growing trend. Marc Navalón, Group Treasury Manager at Ficosa International, says that although his biggest priority is the evolution of the loan market and getting the most out of the corporate banking relationship, “I keep an eye on the corporate bonds market because I think that our access to bank financing would become easier if big corporates and banks continue the issuance trend that we saw last year.”</p>
<h3 id="making-the-capital-work">Making the capital work</h3>
<p>Irrespective of anything else in the market at the moment, the biggest theme is that corporates are demanding much better control over their working capital, according to Raj Subramaniam, Head of Product Strategy and Marketing for Global CASHplus at Fundtech. “They see this as low hanging fruit and it is probably the first thing that they want to address in terms of improving their overall liquidity position.”</p>
<p>When surplus cash is available to corporates, they are looking at investing this in primarily short-term instruments. Subramaniam says, “Corporates are still not looking for the highest yield and the treasury is still not seen as the profit centre of the company. We see many mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) now as corporates feel that, rather than invest the funds in financial assets, it’s better to invest it in new businesses.”</p>
<p>Working in the manufacturing business for a firm that fully relies on bank financing, Navalón reports that in recent years Ficosa has increased cash balances to protect against the squeeze on loan growth. “In addition to that, we try to take a proactive approach to short-term cash management and aim to increase our visibility – and mobility – of cash worldwide as much as possible.”</p>
<p>Ficosa has also placed a sharp focus on cash forecasting which it considers the core of corporate treasury and is extending its supply chain finance (SCF) products in order to reduce the cash consumption for working capital. “All these measures are helping us to sustain most of the financial needs of our businesses and are bringing cash awareness into the overall business,” says Navalón.</p>
<p>For the corporate treasurer, Utopia is a state of negative working capital, believes Subramaniam. “They want to be in a situation where they don’t need to put money aside for the working capital cycle as it is funded by their supply chain instead. Many corporates now see negative working capital as a way forward and are looking at the supply chain and the related available finance as ways for them to move towards that Nirvana state.”</p>
<h3 id="financing-solutions">Financing solutions</h3>
<p>Among the many things that corporates are aiming for in the quest for liquidity is to increase their days payable outstanding (DPO), meaning that they want to pay their suppliers later. This effectively means that the suppliers will have less liquidity, says Kumar. “In many cases, therefore, corporates are establishing strategic relationships with their suppliers and seeking SCF from their banks to establish better credit terms.”</p>
<p>Different types of banks may show strength in different areas of SCF: multinational banks are very focused on vendor financing or supplier financing because the risk is mainly managed against the anchor corporate; while the strong domestic bank is very comfortable assessing the risk of, and providing financing to, dealers and distributors. Regardless of institution type, Subramaniam agrees that banks are offering SCF globally to strengthen and tighten the liquidity chain. “Banks are extending financing to the whole supply chain – not just to the main corporate but also to distributors, dealers and suppliers. This type of financial assistance is the quick win the corporates are looking for.”</p>
<p>Many banks, even up to one or two years ago, were adjusting their liquidity solutions more towards the large or regional corporates, notes Subramaniam. But in the last 12 months, significant demand is also stemming from mid-sized corporates. “Corporates are pushing the banks to give them much better services regarding financial products around the supply chain. These services are linked to payment processing – the corporates want to get that process under tight control so that they can pay out at the very last moment and also pinpoint when they are in need of funds to cover a particular payment,” he says.</p>
<p>Equally important is getting the receivables processing under control and corporates are moving away from paper and migrating towards more electronic ways of management in order to realise this. Subramaniam says, “many banks are looking at this space with interest and are actually outsourcing these facilities rather than putting the pressure on the corporates to make the change.”</p>
<h3 id="global-management">Global management</h3>
<p>Many international corporates have hubs and factories in a number of different countries and regions, yet still want all their balances from various accounts to be immediately visible and easily swept and pooled. Naturally, this can prove to be very complex so they are first looking at liquidity management solutions which will help them define what kind of liquidity control they actually need to have. For example, if a corporate has offices in Belgium and the Netherlands which are primarily production sites (factories) but has customers located in France and Spain (offices), most of the offices will always have a cash surplus, while the factories will ordinarily retain cash deficit as they are making the payments for salaries etc. Subramaniam explains, “the corporates will want to manage liquidity that leaves a higher buffer in the factory location, ie €1m in each of the related accounts. But in the accounts that are customer-related and where money is coming in, this may be completely cancelled out. This kind of fine tuning is what treasuries are doing on a daily basis. Not only do the balances constantly change but the corporate’s liquidity appetite will change too.”</p>
<p>Firms are getting hungry and each treasurer still has to examine the environment and geography they are working in, what opportunities are available and whether the firm can take the counterparty risk involved. Monitoring counterparty risk has not been such a strong focus area for corporates, according to Subramaniam – even in the recent past. He maintains that it was an accepted practice that the transactions were all in the interest of doing business, yet “monitoring these risks across various types of counterparties – both banks and corporates – has now become a very visible activity. Corporates are looking at banks to help them with liquidity management across a country (or region) where they have accounts with multiple banks.”</p>
<p>But despite enjoying a sense of cautious optimism and growth potential in 2013, the first year in several relatively unmarred by impending crisis, the package of capital and liquidity measures that constitutes Basel III still needs to be dealt with by the industry. Basically crafted to compensate for the pitfalls of the financial crisis, Kumar says, “this new regulation modified a one-dimensional Basel concerned with only risk capital to a three-dimensional regulation that covers risk capital, liquidity and leverage. The different requirements under the three areas have an impact on banks and corporates that are both intended and unintended.”</p>

<h3 id="trade-finance">Trade finance</h3>
<p>One significant consequence of Basel III is the heavy burden attached to trade finance, so much so that it will become unattractive for banks to continue to offer these services to corporates, says Subramaniam. But with the relaxed deadlines, has the worry been postponed to a certain extent? “The banks and corporates are continuing to operate in a status quo mode. They have not changed their behaviour too much. They feel there is sufficient time for them to operate current business and still have time to think about what to do next when the deadline comes,” he says.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the strict measures are expected to deliver quite a blow to trade finance, which many corporates use for their imports and exports and their day-to-day working capital. A survey conducted by Asian Development Bank (ADB) in December 2012 revealed that if Basel was implemented as is currently stands, trade finance supply would reduce by around 13%. Kumar explains, “for different asset classes (mortgages/credit cards, etc), there are different risk curves on the basis of which banks would maintain capital. Yet, for trade finance, there is one risk curve which is applicable for trade and all other forms of corporate lending.”</p>
<p>“Similarly with liquidity, there are both intended and unintended impacts. The measures state that banks should have liquid assets that can be used in times of stress – and these assets were defined as government bonds and certain other liquid assets. But the unintended impact was that not all countries/regions had enough available assets in which to invest.”</p>

<h3 id="basel-iii-implications">Basel III implications</h3>
<p>According to Arvind Ronad, Senior Executive Product Strategy and Marketing for Global CASHplus at Fundtech, the corporate treasury impact of the impending measures can be classified into different areas. “It involves more expensive bank funding as banks have to retain more capital to stay inside of their asset portfolio. Secondly, there are the casualties of trade finance as off balance sheet activity, such as the letter of guarantee, which requires five times more capital. The cost must be passed on in both of these cases.”</p>
<p>Corporates will also be forced to rely heavily on the domestic debt market instead of raising funds in the cheaper market elsewhere, as accessing global markets and hedging through cross-currency swaps will be seriously curtailed due to credit value adjustment, says Ronad, “but there is an opportunity for the corporate to create a relationship with the bank because the Basel III liquidity standards will have a significant impact on how banks assess customer liquidity he added. Transaction banking, for example, holds more security as it gives stability to the corporate deposits – a win-win situation for both bank and corporate.”</p>
<p>But the strain of meeting the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), the increasing amount and quality of bank capital, and pressure from local politicians to lend more to customers has led the banks to plead with the Basel Committee and local regulators for some reprieve. Dmitry Pugachevsky, Director of Research at Quantifi Solutions, says, “in January they received some relief, now that implementation of LCR is being phased in, starting with 60% of full requirement in 2015 and full implementation in 2019. Rules were also changed regarding what can be considered as high-quality liquid assets. Understandably, many local regulators didn’t exactly welcome these changes in Basel III LCR treatment and warned banks who already comply at the 60% of full requirement not to decrease the level of high-liquidity assets.”</p>
<p>From a corporate perspective, though, Navalón believes the decision to ease and to postpone the liquidity deadline for banks makes a lot of sense. “Four years ago we entered the ‘new normal’ era, whose fundamental forces are de-leveraging, de-globalisation and re-regulation. And it is the latter we are talking about here. Politicians risk over-reaction to their attempt at controlling the banks activities and this urge to regulate is causing a pro-cyclical effect on the credit channel and, therefore, in corporate access to liquidity. The postponement could be good for corporates if banks resume lending.”</p>
<h3 id="an-expanding-market">An expanding market</h3>
<p>Another level of complexity to the whole liquidity situation is added by the fact that institutions in the US under Dodd-Frank have been mandated to start clearing swaps and other vanilla derivatives since March 2013, says Pugachevsky. “Initial and variation margins presented by central counterparties (CCPs) are putting another strain on banks’ cash and high-quality assets reserves. How this situation will develop remains to be seen because it is just starting, but the fact that there is no cross-netting agreement between CCPs doesn’t help.”</p>
<p>As active as the regulatory space is, however, the corporate environment is continuing to evolve with an increasing drive for growth, says Kumar. Corporates are taking more counterparty risk – and country risk – but they want to manage this risk in a much more holistic manner. “Even in the open account scenario, which is picking up quite a bit in terms of a growing trend, you have a receivable financing product where the bank would take the risk of the buyers and finance the corporate, and so the risk is mitigated. Some corporates tap into the credit insurance market and buy insurance for their buyers and hence mitigate counterparty risk.”</p>
<p>Credit insurance is very readily available in the West, but in emerging markets, the market for credit insurance may not be deep enough. However, SWIFT and ICC have jointly been working on the first end-to-end automated trade finance transaction – the Bank Payment Obligation (BPO). With an April 2013 approval scheduled, the BPO has already gained traction across Asia, providing customers with the flexibility of open account trade combined with the payment certainty of letters of credit (LCs).</p>
<p>Concluding on a positive note, Subramaniam believes that one common trend that can be seen among corporates is that the global worries about financial contagion have decreased considerably. “The panic which was there one or two years back has subsided. Risk is very much on the radar but it’s not the only thing that people are looking at – they are also looking at opportunities,” he says.</p>

<p>Jim Fuell says “Our size reflects our experiences: we have been involved in the money market fund business for 30 years, through numerous market cycles, and seek to offer our clients the benefit of this expertise. Our scale allows us to accommodate large client balances without sacrificing daily liquidity and without a single client becoming a significant shareholder of the fund. This is particularly important in ensuring a diversification of underlying securities and a well diversified client base.</p>
<p>It is true that size is not an automatic guarantee of quality, but in practice it gives us a real depth of resources, in client service, credit research and operational interface. It also enables us to access highly competitive pricing and expedited trading across markets. We aim to be the market leader not only by AUM, but also in terms of quality, innovation and service”.</p>
<h3 id="global-reach-global-innovation">Global reach, global innovation</h3>
<p>We have an array of AAA-rated stable net asset value (NAV) liquidity funds spanning from pure US Treasury and Government Strategies through to our flag ship credit funds. Currencies currently managed in this space are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>USD</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EUR</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GBP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RMB</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JPY</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SGD</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AUD</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The JPMorgan Australian Dollar Liquidity Fund is a recent addition to our Luxembourg liquidity fund umbrella and is offered to clients that hold AUD.</p>
<p>Stepping outside the world of AAA-rated stable NAV funds, we have seen increased interest from investors seeking additional yield through the Managed Reserves Fund, domiciled in Luxembourg for international investors, and the Managed Income Fund in the United States. These are both floating NAV funds which look to provide additional yield by extending duration outside the money market fund space into the six- to nine-month portion of the curve.</p>
<p>In anticipation of a rising-rate environment, the Current Yield Money Market Fund, with a maximum weighted average maturity (WAM) of ten days, was launched in the United States at the end of 2010. This innovative product offers quicker yield adjustment than traditional money market funds within a rising-rate environment.</p>
<p>This series of new products reflects changes in customer requirements which J.P. Morgan Asset Management is well-placed to satisfy. “A key trend within our client base will be the increasing globalisation of companies, and their move into additional regional markets. This will create demand for funds denominated in new currencies, and also for those managers who are able to provide a truly global service to their clients,” comments Fuell.</p>
<p>Indeed, over recent years the J.P. Morgan Asset Management Global Cash Management survey, conducted in conjunction with the Association of Corporate Treasurers (ACT), has reflected a gradual move towards a global cash management structure, as the events of the financial crisis have emphasised the importance for treasurers of having immediate access to information including cash balances, counterparty exposures and foreign exchange across their entire firm.</p>
<p>This trend continued in 2010, with 74% of treasury departments structuring their cash management either globally or with global oversight, compared with 66% in 2009. In the future, this is expected to rise to 80%, with 46% of treasury departments moving to a pure global structure.</p>
<p>“One way we have been able to help treasurers with maintaining a global oversight is to offer liquidity funds that, despite being located in different markets and currencies, are managed to a consistent process, in line with the primary objective of capital preservation,” says Fuell. “And in all regions, we are differentiated by our size, our client focus and service and our rigorous investment approach.”</p>
<h3 id="client-servicing-and-technology">Client servicing and technology</h3>
<p>Recognised for its high service standards, J.P. Morgan Global Liquidity aggregates its platforms into an exceptional client experience by offering three regionally located client service desks. Staffed with multilingual teams, the client service desks continuously manage business needs globally and locally from across the globe:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Delaware</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Luxembourg</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Japan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shanghai</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hong Kong</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ensuring around the clock global operation. Systems and information are shared globally, so clients in any region can call the service desks and receive up-to-date information on positions and holdings, make inquiries and place trades.</p>
<p>Global trading is further simplified for clients with a range of convenient transaction options, including late-day fund cut-off times, unlimited fund transactions and multiple redemption payment times throughout the day, allowing access to working capital at any time. J.P. Morgan Asset Management’s direct debit functionality makes funding purchases easier by linking investment and demand deposit accounts (available internally in multiple countries and where possible externally), and by eliminating the need for wire transfers.</p>
<p>Additionally, we maintain a dedicated on-boarding team and streamlined account opening process that allows expedited startup while complying with all regulatory requirements. Fuell comments, “An advantage is that our operational efficiencies allow clients to open an account with us in an hour or so and, subject to fund cut-off times, subscribe same day. Similarly clients do not have to wait for an end of day batch where redemptions are concerned as we process them intra-day, providing liquidity to clients where required.” We are dedicated to providing innovative solutions for specific client needs from transmission trade processing to coverage from Japan to Shanghai, Luxembourg and the United States.</p>
<p>As a technology leader, J.P. Morgan Asset Management continues to invest heavily in systems, software and development to help clients around the world increase efficiency, profitability and competitive edge. Our clients can manage their liquidity needs online through the Global Cash Portal, executing trades, accessing their account information, checking fund and market performance, and viewing commentaries from global experts.</p>
<p>Our Global Liquidity website is another excellent resource that simplifies and accelerates the global liquidity management process by keeping clients fully informed about opportunities that provide clients with access to valuable information. In 2010, the website and the Global Cash Portal became seamlessly integrated, making it highly efficient to place trades and steer between the latest research and fund information.</p>
<p>Fuell explains, “Around two thirds of our clients now trade through our Global Cash Portal, which allows clients to execute trades, access their account information, check fund and market performance, and download contract notes, trade confirmations and account data.”</p>
<h3 id="liquidity-insights-redefining-thought-leadership">Liquidity Insights: redefining thought leadership</h3>
<p>At the core of J.P. Morgan Global Liquidity is its focus on thought leadership. The Liquidity Insights programme shares the firm’s intellectual capital, including investment insights and resources, with clients worldwide. Through white papers, economic and market bulletins, surveys, conference calls, web discussions, investment forums and other face-to-face meeting opportunities, J.P. Morgan Global Liquidity provides the value-added information that defines leadership. “To keep this programme relevant and meaningful we encourage dialogue with all corporate treasurers whether existing clients or not” comments Fuell. In 2010, Liquidity insights topics of interest included:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Best practices for managing your cash investments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weighing the risks and rewards for cash investments: a disciplined approach for evaluating investment solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A practical guide to evaluating counterparty and sovereign risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A practical guide to evaluating interest rate risk and liquidity risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A global perspective on investing cash in local markets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="working-to-stabilise-the-industry">Working to stabilise the industry</h3>
<p>During the most difficult time period for money markets, J.P. Morgan’s management team was highly engaged in the industry’s efforts to bring greater stability to the financial markets, including its participation in the Investment Company Institute’s Money Market Fund working group within the United States. As part of this group, J.P. Morgan was instrumental in developing proposed guidelines for money market funds aimed at strengthening the industry and further enhancing the safety and stability of all money market funds. In Europe and Asia, J.P. Morgan continued to express its commitment to the industry by sharing best practices and working closely with the Institutional Money Market Funds Association.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>When investors are looking for safety, liquidity and diversification, they clearly want a manager they can trust, as well as one with a proven track record. Size and experience allow J.P. Morgan Global Liquidity to quickly respond to clients’ immediate liquidity requirements, and to offer exceptional solutions that meet diverse needs. In addtion to liquidity funds, J.P. Morgan Asset Management offers a wide range of products for a wide breadth of investment needs.</p>

<p>The money market fund industry in the US is the biggest in the world and has the longest history. J.P. Morgan’s 2010 survey showed that 65% of treasurers for organisations with North American headquarters currently use prime money market funds, compared with a global average of 59%. 41% of treasurers in North America said money market funds were their most-used cash management tool, compared with 35% overall. Only 26% of North American treasurers chose bank deposits as their most-used tool, versus 41% overall.</p>
<p>In the United States, J.P. Morgan offers 13 USD-denominated taxable, tax-aware and tax-free, rated and non-rated money market funds registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, with assets totalling $246 billion. This includes the JPMorgan Prime Money Market Fund, the industry’s largest money market fund with assets of more than $130 billion. To ensure a best-in-class client experience, in the United States, J.P. Morgan Global Liquidity has 30 dedicated sales and relationship management professionals located across the region. An additional 41 investment management professionals, such as portfolio managers and credit research staff, are located in both Columbus, Ohio, and New York. Further, the J.P. Morgan Global Liquidity staffs three client service teams on three different continents to ensure complete coverage and continuity. The US-based team currently encompasses 30 people headquartered in Delaware that service clients globally.</p>
<h3 id="global-liquidity-european-platform">Global Liquidity European Platform</h3>
<p>In Europe, J.P. Morgan is the largest provider of AAA-rated stable NAV money market funds with assets of $156 billion and a 22.7% market share. This includes the largest USD fund – the JPMorgan USD Liquidity Fund – with assets of $89 billion; and the largest EUR fund – the JPMorgan Euro Liquidity Fund – with assets of €19 billion. The JPMorgan Sterling Liquidity Fund had £7.3 billion in AUM in January 2011. All institutional money market funds on the European platform are domiciled in Luxembourg.</p>
<p>A dedicated sales team, located across Europe, is staffed with 14 people and based in London, Frankfurt, Paris, Brussels, Luxembourg, Vienna and Madrid. An experienced team of Portfolio Managers who are based in London, manage the sterling and euro Liquidity funds. The European-based client service team includes a multilingual staff of 25 and is located in Luxembourg.</p>
<h3 id="global-liquidity-asian-platform">Global Liquidity Asian Platform</h3>
<p>Money market funds are new to Asian investors compared with those in the US and Europe and J.P. Morgan has been leading the development of AAA-rated funds in the marketplace since 2005 when JPMorgan launched the first AAA-rated money market fund in China through its joint venture China International Fund Management Company. JPMorgan also offers the only AAA-rated money market fund onshore in Japan in JPY and also in Singapore dollar. Most recently, an Australian dollar fund was added to the platform.</p>
<p>“We are committed to leading the development of products tailored to the Asian market, where both our global and domestic clients are seeking better investment alternatives that offer the right combination of security, liquidity and yield,” says Travis Spence, Head of Global Liquidity Asia for J.P. Morgan Asset Management.</p>
<p>“Although investment returns have always been a key driver for decisions in Asia, counterparty risk continues to be a primary concern for Asian treasurers and their experience during the financial crisis has taught many lessons, especially the need for enhanced due diligence and understanding of investment products on offer. The diversification we offer in our liquidity funds has been well received in the market, and we have seen our Asian funds grow to over $7 billion equivalent AUM, with most of the growth during the last three years.”</p>

		<content><![CDATA[




<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>What are the genuine challenges that corporates face in global liquidity management today? J.P. Morgan Treasury Services posed this question to clients worldwide prior to the development of a single global liquidity platform and online portal. In this Product Profile we examine the common liquidity pain points that companies are experiencing today and look at an innovative solution designed to tackle these issues at their core.</p>
<h3 id="liquidity-challenges">Liquidity challenges</h3>
<p>In today’s tough financial environment, where bank credit lines are still a precious commodity, one of the most easily accessible sources of funding a company has is its own working capital. While there has been a significant trend among treasurers to revisit internal processes, particularly along the supply chain (reducing DSO and increasing DPO) to free up working capital, addressing the ‘value’ of cash is another matter altogether. As cash is the most liquid asset, it is also the most ‘valuable’ asset. But what is standing in the way of optimal international liquidity management?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Achieving visibility and control across multiple bank accounts and providers.</h5>
<p>“Being able to navigate between accounts and providers in multiple countries and currencies can be time consuming, and difficult to consolidate into reliable, usable data,” says Dan Dougherty, Executive Director, Liquidity Solutions, J.P. Morgan. “Process efficiency, as well as security and controls are also key issues here,” says Dougherty, “and they apply equally to all treasury structures and company sizes.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Establishing and maintaining complex liquidity structures.</h5>
<p>In many of the developing countries, the legal and regulatory framework needed to support notional pooling is itself developing. When virtual and hybrid pooling solutions are used to overcome this inability to pool notionally for example, this can add extra layers of complexity, making it harder to keep track of where the company’s cash actually is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Accurate cash flow forecasting.</h5>
<p>Lack of visibility of cash impacts accurate forecasting. If the data on company cash positions is incomplete or simply not available, accurate forecasting is far more difficult to achieve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Optimising the value of debit and credit balances in multiple jurisdictions.</h5>
<p>Variance in local liquidity management rules and regulations with regard to credit interest and balance off-set, for example, provides treasurers with additional tasks around jurisdiction assessment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-can-be-done">What can be done?</h4>
<p>In order to help overcome these barriers to effective cash management, treasurers are turning to technology. While online platforms were traditionally used to provide an easy means of carrying out simple transactions, banks have been investing significantly into their online capabilities to provide a wider range of functionalities, including multibank liquidity management, investment execution and also liquidity reporting. We spoke to one J.P. Morgan client about his global liquidity challenges and what he expects from an online portal now and in the future:</p>

<h2 id="case-study">Case study</h2>
<h3 id="red-hat">Red Hat</h3>

<figure class="portrait left"><img alt="Portrait of Frank Pirozzi, Assistant Treasurer, Red Hat" height="150" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/2010/06/2010-06-tt-04-pp-frank-pirozzi-100x150.jpg" width="100"/></figure>

<img alt="Red Hat logo" class="logo" height="55" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/redhat-logo-2010-50x55.png" title="Red Hat" width="50"/>

<p class="management-summary">Headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, Red Hat is the world’s leading provider of open source solutions and has over 65 offices spanning the globe. An S&amp;P 500 company, Red Hat provides high-quality, affordable technology with its operating system platform, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, together with virtualisation, applications, management and Services Oriented Architecture (SOA). Red Hat also offers support, training and consulting services to its customers worldwide.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-the-major-challenges-you-face-in-terms-of-global-liquidity-management">What are the major challenges you face in terms of global liquidity management?</h5>
<p>Our treasury operation is completely centralised here in the US. Because of time zone differences, we have one treasury manager based in Singapore to oversee regional activity, but we monitor all global bank account activity from Raleigh.</p>
<p>Right now we are dealing with several challenges. Treasury automation is one. At Red Hat, bank account monitoring is not yet fully automated, which makes pulling information together a time-consuming process. That said, our goal is to fully automate the function and to be a leader in this space. We are also dealing with issues in the emerging markets. First and foremost, you have to comply with local laws, which can make it difficult to maintain cash visibility. In these markets, you are also often dealing with bank reporting in local language, which makes it a challenge to integrate account information.</p>
<p>To help us cope with some of these issues, we need a single online portal where we can view all our bank accounts and have the information we need to manage and optimise our balances globally.</p>
<h5 id="what-capabilities-would-you-expect-from-an-online-liquidity-portal">What capabilities would you expect from an online liquidity portal?</h5>
<p>The first thing is transparency – I want to see what my balances are on a real-time basis. We do have a large portion of our bank accounts with J.P. Morgan, but in a few geographies we have some local bank relationships. If these banks can report through J.P. Morgan’s multibank functionality, that’s a big step towards making my global liquidity management easier. I want to be able to see what’s going on in my bank accounts across the globe as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The second requirement is security. We need a system that gives us the flexibility to set up our security procedures in a way that works best for our operation and is supported by a security environment that ensures complete protection of our transactions and information.</p>
<p>The last requirement is execution. Being able to do everything online where there is full visibility, full accountability and a full audit trail of what’s happening is paramount.</p>
<h5 id="how-important-is-the-bank-relationship-when-considering-an-online-liquidity-portal">How important is the bank relationship when considering an online liquidity portal?</h5>
<p>I want to work with a bank that is dedicated to international treasury management and expanding their footprint around the world. We have a close relationship with J.P. Morgan for a couple of reasons – the financial environment of the recent past has been a big eye opener in the banking sector and their stability has been very comforting to us. The second thing that we particularly like about J.P. Morgan is the functionality and accessibility of their online portal – J.P. Morgan ACCESSSM. We are able to use it and develop a global process whereby people in countries all over the world can log on to J.P. Morgan ACCESS and can initiate payments and look at bank balances and so on. So that is a very good tool for us.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-see-liquidity-challenges-developing-over-the-next-12-months">How do you see liquidity challenges developing over the next 12 months?</h5>
<p>I think the persistent challenge for us will be going into more non-traditional based markets and the complexities associated with those new markets. The question really is how can I continue to have my centralised treasury concept and my worldwide visibility and still adhere to the variety of local laws and restrictions?</p>
<p>That’s really something that I’m going to look to my bank partner to help me with. I will be looking for them to provide me with guidance and expertise in the countries and areas where I simply don’t know the rules and regulations well enough. I need my bank to have local knowledge about how to make cash management effective within the confines of the law.</p>
<p>Much of the problem revolves around opening up bank accounts and the various documentation standards involved. What we want is a template of all the documentation we will need and a centralised depository for keeping track of authorised individuals for instance. In my mind, consistency can only be a good thing in the business of cash management.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we are trying to do everything electronically and to get rid of paper in our treasury function. A portal could really help us to achieve this paperless aim – and this goes for reporting as well as transactions.</p>

<h3 id="rising-to-the-challenge">Rising to the challenge</h3>
<p>In order to help multi-regional treasurers overcome the challenges outlined above, J.P. Morgan has been investing heavily into its online portal, J.P. Morgan ACCESS Liquidity Solutions. The portal currently enables multicurrency, real-time liquidity management and liquidity structure manipulation, together with cash flow forecasting and global transaction capabilities. With this new investment push however, J.P. Morgan is confident that we will see the birth of a truly global liquidity management platform that will allow not only multibank liquidity visibility, mobilisation and control worldwide but also liquidity execution and reporting through a standardised offering.</p>
<p>The front end of the portal will feature a user-friendly dashboard with a wide range of functions, such as the ability to view cash concentration structures in a diagrammatic way. The user has the ability to click on the individual accounts to view the underlying data.</p>
<p>We spoke to J.P. Morgan’s Dougherty about the bank’s plans for this solution and how its design addresses many of the global liquidity challenges clients are facing:</p>

<h5 id="how-typical-is-red-hats-experience">How typical is Red Hat’s experience?</h5>
<p>We’re speaking to clients every day right across the globe and these experiences are common. The major pain points come down to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Managing multiple accounts across several bank relationships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Executing liquidity management transactions in a non-standardised multibank environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimising value of debit and credit balances across time zones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collating accurate, real-time, standardised reports to feed into cash flow forecasts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="how-has-jpmorgan-responded">How has J.P. Morgan responded?</h5>
<p>We’ve done a vast amount of research to build a comprehensive, scalable solution. We also wanted a standardised solution so that the client experience was homogenous across regions. Our approach was twofold:</p>
<p>Firstly, we completely rebuilt the back-end liquidity platform which supports our cash concentration, investment and risk management propositions worldwide. The new platform will help us to expedite the roll-out of all new client-facing capabilities, as they are developed.</p>
<p>Secondly, we’ve rebuilt the front end, ie we’ve integrated new, standardised liquidity management, investment management and risk management propositions into our online global portal, J.P. Morgan ACCESS Liquidity Solutions.</p>
<p>Clients can use this real-time reporting tool to monitor and execute all liquidity transaction types. They’ll also benefit from innovative on-screen liquidity structure views to help track and manipulate the most complex intercompany structures.</p>
<p>The front end is of course multibank enabled so that clients can do business with all their banks and gain full visibility over cash positions. This is true even in some of the more difficult locations, such as China.</p>
<p>The portal is also fully self-service so clients can initiate investments themselves, booking time deposits for instance, across the globe and across currencies.</p>
<p>With regard to global roll-out of both platform and portal, we’re doing a phased release and Europe is expected to come online in October 2010.</p>
<h5 id="how-important-is-reporting-on-a-global-scale">How important is reporting on a global scale?</h5>
<p>We have clients who deal in so many different locations and jurisdictions and whether it’s specific regulatory reporting requirements, audit requirements or the control around those requirements, the client has to provide resources within their organisation to do this.</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan ACCESS Liquidity Solutions provides the client with the opportunity to do on-demand reporting. Daily report functionalities include alerts, counterparty exposure vs agreed limits, investment performance and FX activity. These reports are available at group, subsidiary, fund and individual cash account levels and can be exported from the portal in PDF, CSV or Excel formats so that they can be easily integrated into the client’s systems.</p>
<h5 id="who-is-this-portal-suitable-for-and-how-is-it-implemented">Who is this portal suitable for and how is it implemented?</h5>
<p>The portal is aimed at all clients who are facing the types of cross-border challenges we have discussed, regardless of size, treasury structure or industry. Clients clearly do not have to bank solely with J.P. Morgan, given the multibank reporting and transaction initiation features. The portal also offers multi-language capabilities to overcome some of the more human barriers that companies face.</p>

<h3 id="looking-to-the-future">Looking to the future</h3>
<p>Going forward, treasurers will be looking to their banking partners to help them to make informed treasury decisions based on the ability to analyse company information in real-time. The key to success in the provision of tools that accurately address these needs is two-way dialogue and collaboration.</p>
<p>After all, banks can only address genuine corporate needs if their clients talk to them openly about the problems they are encountering.</p>
<p>Equally, banks need to remain vigilant when developing online solutions, as treasury challenges – as we saw with the financial crisis – can, and do, change. As Dougherty concludes, “It’s not about assuming we have understood the client’s challenges and then standing still. It’s about maintaining a continuous dialogue with the client to ensure that our solution addresses these challenges as they evolve.”</p>

<h3 id="jp-morgan">J.P. Morgan</h3>
<p>J.P. Morgan has a unique status in treasury and cash management. We are a full service provider offering traditional transactional capabilities, liquidity and investment management, and global trade services across the entire financial and physical supply chain.</p>
<p>We understand you select a banking partner based on a variety of individual requirements. Our continuing investment in quality treasury and supply chain solutions demonstrates our determination to help you succeed.</p>
<p>Operating within a diverse financial environment requires practical answers on a global scale, but delivered with local expertise.</p>
<p>Industry regulation, economic climate and evolving technology present the treasurer with opportunities – and challenges. We understand how to help you take advantage of both.</p>
<p>This is our business.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>Given the recent spate of banking regulation prompted by the global financial crisis, treasurers are rethinking their approach to liquidity management. In this Business Briefing we examine the likely impact of new regulation on liquidity management and what this means for treasury departments.</p>
<h3 id="global-shockwaves">Global shockwaves</h3>
<p>Since September 2008 and the demise of Lehman Brothers, regulators across the globe have been trying to understand the causes of the financial crisis. Regulatory bodies have also been introducing new measures in an attempt to ensure that there are no repeats of the recent financial, and subsequent, economic traumas. Inevitably, this regulatory soul-searching has led to issuance of new legislation and guidance:</p>

<h3 id="post-crisis-regulation-snapshot">Post-crisis regulation snapshot</h3>
<h4 id="united-kingdom">United Kingdom</h4>
<h5 id="uk-banking-act">UK Banking Act</h5>
<p>Replacing the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008, which expired on 20<sup>th</sup> February 2009, the UK Banking Act aims to strengthen stability in the UK banking sector. The Act includes the implementation of a new special resolution regime (SRR) for addressing bank failures and protecting depositors.</p>
<h5 id="financial-services-bill">Financial Services Bill</h5>
<p>The Financial Services Bill introduces a range of measures designed to protect the consumers of UK financial services, including the creation of a Council for Financial Stability. One particular provision requires companies to develop ‘living wills’ in order to better understand the risks involved in their business, better cope with periods of stress and be capable of winding down the business in the event of future crisis without excessive cost to the taxpayer.</p>
<h4 id="europe">Europe</h4>
<h5 id="strengthening-the-resilience-of-the-banking-sector-consultation-paper">Strengthening the resilience of the banking sector – consultation paper</h5>
<p>In December 2009 the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision approved this package of proposals, including strengthening capital requirements, restricting excessive leverage in the banking system, building up capital buffers and introducing global liquidity standards.</p>
<h5 id="cross-border-bank-resolution-recommendations">Cross-border bank resolution recommendations</h5>

	This paper puts forward recommendations relating to the strengthening of national crisis resolution powers and their crossborder implementation. It also advocates the use of various risk mitigation measures to limit the market impact of future bank failures.
	
	<h4 id="us">US</h4>

<p>Senator Chris Dodd’s Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act protects US consumers from abusive credit card practices, such as arbitrary interest rate and charge increases and unnecessary fees, for example.</p>

<p>“While it is true to say that much of this legislation deals with consumer protection and orderly resolution of failing banks without the levels of taxpayer support experienced in 2009, the regulators have also concerned themselves with the causes of the crisis and attempted to introduce measures that could avoid widespread market disruption,” says Yera Hagopian, Global Product Manager for Liquidity Services, HSBC.</p>
<p>But what is the impact of this on corporates and their treasury processes? As Hagopian explains, in order to understand the connection with cash management, we need first to appreciate that the financial crisis was ultimately caused by a crisis in liquidity. In other words, the market discovered what every dispossessed homeowner has known for a long time, that you can be illiquid without being insolvent.</p>
<h3 id="liquidity-liquidity-liquidity">Liquidity, liquidity, liquidity</h3>
<p>Given this backdrop, though the saying may seem somewhat trite and out-of-date, liquidity can still be defined as ‘having the right amount of money in the right place at the right time’. So, in the context of the cash management and settlement services provided by banks, what does this really mean?</p>
<h4 id="having-the-right-amount-of-money">Having the right amount of money</h4>
<p>While this saying resonates strongly on the corporate side of the equation, the banks also have an important role to play here. Funding payments through most settlement systems is one such aspect of this role. “Some settlement systems may allow for a small measure of lending by the central bank,” says Robin Terry, Head of Global Banking Sales Europe, HSBC, “but largely payments have to be funded. However, the challenge is that banks’ customers do not always pre-fund payments.” The market has come to rely on intraday lines as standard practice to gloss over timing differences and ensure that attractive rates are not sacrificed and value days are not lost when, for example, investing surplus funds.</p>
<p>So, for instance, a corporate treasurer will make their investment decision mid-morning in anticipation of funds that they expect to come into their account much later in the day. The company’s cash management bank provides the treasurer with an intraday line and the payment is made, but the bank itself has generally had to put up collateral with the central bank to fund the payment. If the bank is a deposit taker, the collateral can be funded from surplus funds (although this does not necessarily mean the funding is entirely free). As Terry says however, “For non deposit takers operating as a cash management provider in a particular market, the cost of intraday liquidity provision can be significant because funding has to be provided from capital.”</p>
<h4 id="in-the-right-place">In the right place</h4>
<p>In the context of cash management, the ‘right place’ is in the correct settlement system and the appropriate currency. Funding/ collateral has to be available in the applicable settlement system and generally in the right currency. However intraday credit lines marked for customers are frequently multi-currency lines, meaning that the liquidity can be drawn down in any one of a number of currencies. “This is highly effective from a credit utilisation perspective,” says Terry, “it avoids a situation where credit appetite to a single counterparty is eaten up by a series of parallel single currency lines each with low utilisation.” However, it does create a potential currency mismatch which in extreme circumstances, could stress liquidity self-sufficiency.</p>
<h4 id="at-the-right-time">At the right time</h4>
<p>Although the crisis has raised awareness that bank funding is not available to corporates ‘on tap’, collateral to oil the wheels of a settlement process is often seen as a given. Even this, though, cannot be drummed up at a moment’s notice as banks do not build up a stable deposit base overnight. As such, additional capital may be required, especially if customers are to be provided with substantial potential intraday lines.</p>

Even this, though, cannot be drummed up at a moment’s notice as banks do not build up a stable deposit base overnight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“The majority of these lines may not be drawn most of the time, but regulators are now looking at stress-testing scenarios when the largest of these lines may be fully drawn and basing capital requirements on these cases,” says Hagopian. Although regulators are wary of adding to stresses in still fragile economies, this type of stress-testing is likely, in the medium term, to lead to an increase in funding/collateral and could lead to increased cost in the provision of intraday liquidity for everyone involved.</p>
<h3 id="impact-on-banks">Impact on banks</h3>
<p>There will be a chain of cause and effect here. Regulation will have consequences for the banks, which will then filter down to the corporate sector. So, what will be the impact of new regulations on the banks and what will this mean for corporate customers?</p>
<p>Some anticipated impacts include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Focus on reporting.</h5>
<p>“The initial focus for most banks has been the requirement to meet detailed reporting requirements. It is true that these are onerous but the real impact for banks is likely to become clearer over time,” advises Hagopian.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Increased operational efficiency.</h5>
<p>Previously, the mantra of any good payments provider was operational efficiency. The requirement for operational efficiency has not gone away, because operational incidents can of course, present their own stresses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Increased risk awareness and differentiation.</h5>
<p>Similarly, the requirement to manage counterparty risk is still paramount. However, now with hindsight, all payment providers are recognising that liquidity is not only a raw material of variable cost and availability, but ultimately a differentiator in the cash management space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Increased barriers to entry.</h5>
<p>For new entrants, the capital requirements of funding/collateralising their payments business could represent a very real barrier to entry.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While these effects have not yet come to fruition, potential pitfalls are already being pinpointed. According to Terry for example, “The requirement to manage liquidity more efficiently may run counter to operational efficiency. It is not hard to envisage a situation where the desire to optimise funding requirements leads to delays in submitting payments to settlement systems as banks try to avoid peaks of liquidity utilisation that cause cost spikes.” Ironically, this type of manipulation by settlement banks could create additional operational risk through payments bunching.</p>
<p>While payment schemes understand these risks and are already considering the impacts, the point illustrates the complexity of dealing with regulation and its wide-spread consequences.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-this-mean-for-corporates">What does this mean for corporates?</h3>
<p>Until now, the provision of intraday liquidity has played a vital role in the cash management service offering. “Uncommitted, unadvised perhaps but undeniably present,” comments Terry. Will corporates be left high and dry in the future, will costs soar to untenable levels or will some middle ground arrangement be reached?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If cost recovery proves difficult, availability of intraday liquidity may reduce. There are various potential knock-on effects of this development: of course, internally generated cash will become even more important and further resources may be focused on projects to improve corporate liquidity management.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While it is still early days to predict any effects of the regulatory focus on intraday liquidity with great confidence or precision, it is possible to see some signs for the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Already in the cash management market some providers are talking about the cost of providing liquidity and there have been predictions that this commodity will not be free in the future. The rationale for such predictions is understandable but it is much harder to predict how such an evolution will take place. Without further regulatory intervention, charging for intraday liquidity will become a competitive issue since the cost base of different providers will vary significantly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If cost recovery proves difficult, availability of intraday liquidity may reduce. There are various potential knock-on effects of this development: of course, internally generated cash will become even more important and further resources may be focused on projects to improve corporate liquidity management. “However, the standard panacea, tick-in-the-box approach favoured by so many – the appointment of an overlay bank – may no longer yield the desired results,” warns Hagopian. With multiple banks involved in the process and potentially uncontrollable delays in up-streaming of funds from local banks to the overlay bank, liquidity may not be in the right place at the right time, leaving the overlay bank holding the proverbial intraday liquidity baby. Overlay banks may try to push the burden of intraday liquidity provision downstream by obliging local banks to remit funds before they have been collected but the latter are likely to resist the imposition of an additional cost without any return. Therefore, the separation of ‘transaction bank’ and ‘overlay bank’ may no longer be feasible. This will mean that corporates will need to revisit their existing banking structures and practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to reduce the reliance on bank-provided liquidity, it is likely that more fundamental organisational change will take place. This could be through the creation of an in-house bank, centralisation of payables and receivables functions and/or centralisation of accounts as far as possible, while preserving access to relevant clearings systems, for example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For those corporates operating in euro, the impact of the regulations discussed above may be a catalyst for the centralisation of accounts, or for those that SEPA failed to activate. “After all, losing a day’s value on your entire cashflow is a far better business case than slightly lower fees or hard to quantify administrative savings,” says Terry. “However a word of warning is required: not all centralisation projects are equal. A project to centralise merely the payments of the business is likely to add to the liquidity stresses.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="liquidity-management-solutions">Liquidity management solutions</h3>
<p>Assuming that some degree of account centralisation has been achieved, what can corporates do beyond structural change?</p>
<p>According to Hagopian, one of the most effective tools to maximise earnings from transactional balances without incurring operationally intensive overheads is the superimposition of a crosscurrency notional pool over centralised accounts.</p>
<figure class="center">
<figcaption>
<h5 id="diagram-1-notional-cross-currency-pool">Diagram 1: Notional cross-currency pool</h5>
</figcaption>
<a class="enlargeable" href="http://treasurytoday.com/i/2010/05/2010-05-tt-12-bb-diagram-01-notional-cross-currency-pool.png"><img alt="Diagram 1: Notional cross-currency pool" height="90" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/2010/05/2010-05-tt-12-bb-diagram-01-notional-cross-currency-pool-t.png" width="300"/></a>
</figure>
<p>This allows the consolidation of funds without the need for physical conversion or the daily chase for the best FX rates. The avoidance of daily conversion also minimises the requirement for external settlement which can impose additional strain on already stretched intraday liquidity. The funds remain in the underlying currencies, ready to be used to fund transactions on the following day but at the same time interest costs are reduced on potentially overdrawn currency positions. From an administrative perspective, interest is calculated and applied in the original currency resulting in transparency from an intra-group pricing and taxation perspective.</p>
<p>Last but not least, operational risk and reconciliation requirements are radically reduced by avoiding the need for currency conversions since it is the bank that takes the currency positions into its books.</p>
<p>“If the cross-currency pool is overall in surplus and it is company policy to pursue an active investment strategy, the surplus can be drawn down from the pool and invested in an approved investment vehicle such as money market funds,” says Hagopian.</p>
<p>So, while many potential difficulties surrounding proposed regulation have been identified, there are solutions available to corporates that have already been tried and tested.</p>
<h3 id="going-forward">Going forward</h3>
<p>What still remains to be seen, though, is how new regulations will actually be enforced and whether the geographical playing field will be level. “There is far greater recognition than in the past amongst regulators that banks, systems and currencies are inextricably linked and there has been more cross-border consultation than seen before in drafting new regulations and guidelines,” concludes Terry. However, this alone cannot provide a guarantee of uniformity. Ultimately the responsibility of each regulator is to its local depositors and tax payers. Corporates should therefore ensure regular dialogue with their banking partners to keep abreast of the latest developments and work together to find optimal solutions.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<p>In order to address economic concerns, the Chinese authorities adopted a more stringent monetary policy during the first half of 2008 and as a result, liquidity became scarcer. Recent market turmoil has seen a shift towards a looser policy, but the effects of this loosening are yet to filter through. Consequently, companies are more focused than ever on managing working capital effectively in order to reduce funding requirements and put excess cash to good use.</p>
<h3 id="economic-background">Economic background</h3>
<p>While China’s strong economic growth in recent years has provided a number of opportunities, concerns have been growing that the economy is overheating. A key issue is inflation, which rose dramatically in late 2007 and early 2008, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) reaching a peak of 8.7% in February 2008 – the highest level for 12 years and far exceeding the central bank’s target of 4.8% for 2008.</p>
<p>China’s trade surplus has also been causing concern, creating pressure for the RMB to appreciate. Currency appreciation has been further driven by the creation of around 12m new private sector jobs in 2007. Given China’s export-driven economy, currency appreciation could have an adverse impact by making exports less competitive. Meanwhile the creation of asset bubbles (ie dramatic increases in asset prices) in the stock market, property market and other industries also prompted action from the authorities. This is of concern because such bubbles are liable to burst or deflate when market conditions become less hospitable.</p>
<h4 id="regulatory-response">Regulatory response</h4>
<p>In response to these issues, the central bank moved from a ‘prudent’ to a ‘tight’ monetary policy in December 2007. This has been manifested in a number of different actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Interest rates.</h5>
<p>In order to tackle inflation, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has repeatedly raised interest rates. The 2006 short-term borrowing rate of 5.85% was successively lifted to 7.47% before being cut to 7.20% in September 2008. The one-year deposit rate has likewise been raised from 2.25% in 2006 to the current rate of 4.14%. In contrast, interest rates previously stood unchanged for nine years until 2004.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Reserve ratio.</h5>
<p>Banks’ reserve requirements – ie the percentage of deposits that must be set aside – have also been repeatedly increased in order to take liquidity out of the financial sector. Successive hikes brought the rate to 17.5%, up from 9.0% at the beginning of 2007. In September 2008, however, the rate was cut to 16.5% (15.5% for banks registered in an area affected by the earthquake of 12<sup>th</sup> May). The five largest banks and the Postal Savings Bank, meanwhile, are still subject to the 17.5% rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Reduced offshore borrowings.</h5>
<p>Looking beyond the domestic market, measures have also been taken to reduce foreign currency lending. The quota for short-term foreign currency debt was dramatically reduced in 2007, with local banks’ quotas cut to 30% of the 2006 level and foreign banks’ quotas cut to 60% of the 2006 level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Bank lending.</h5>
<p>The China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) has issued guidance to all limiting the growth of outstanding loans.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of the measures taken by the PBOC, and assisted by the effects of slowing global economic growth, inflation is showing signs of slowing, with the CPI down to 4.9% in August 2008. Asset bubbles in the property market and stock exchanges also appear to be reducing, with residential property transactions in August 2008 down 70% from the same period last year and the Shanghai Composite Index down to 1,909.941 in mid October 2008, compared to a high of 6,124.04 in October 2007. However, these measures have also had the effect of slowing economic growth (now predicted to grow by approximately 9.0% in 2008 compared to 11.9% in 2007) as well as the liquidity available to corporates.</p>

<h4 id="the-implications-for-corporates">The implications for corporates</h4>
<p>This credit crisis has affected companies differently depending on their funding requirements. Companies that have plenty of cash have seen relatively little impact. However, sources of funding are limited in China and companies that are short of cash have been caught off guard. The impact has been particularly felt by SMEs as banks have concentrated on offering liquidity to their biggest clients.</p>
<p>Companies that are feeling the effects of this credit crunch have had to adapt their priorities to the worsening conditions. As Tim Fleming, Sales Head, China Treasury &amp; Trade Solutions, Citi Global Transaction Services explains, “Last year, our clients were looking at rationalising bank relationships, process improvements, shared services and centralising their treasury processes.</p>
<p>These things are still very important, but they have had to move down the priority list. Suddenly our clients have had to concentrate on making sure they have adequate funding and the working capital that they need to operate.”</p>
<h3 id="optimising-working-capital">Optimising working capital</h3>
<p>Working capital is defined as the difference between a company’s short-term assets and short-term liabilities. As a basic requirement, companies need to have enough current assets available to meet their current liabilities. Beyond this, companies will also aim to keep a certain amount of working capital in reserve for unforeseen liabilities. It is important to get this right as too much excess cash represents a wasted opportunity, while too little puts the company at risk of failing to meets its obligations.</p>
<p>Companies may adopt a conservative strategy, keeping plenty of cash in reserve, or an aggressive strategy, reducing working capital to the lowest possible level. In either case, working capital should be managed as efficiently as possible to ensure that the company is not holding more than needed so that any freed-up capital can be used effectively.</p>
<p>Techniques that can be employed to optimise working capital include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Cash concentration.</h5>
<p>Using cash management techniques to concentrate idle cash and put it to good use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Increasing Days Payable Outstanding (DPO).</h5>
<p>In other words, paying suppliers later so that the company holds onto its cash for as long as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Reducing Days Sales Outstanding (DSO).</h5>
<p>This is achieved by collecting due payments from customers as quickly as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Reducing Days Inventories Outstanding (DIO).</h5>
<p>This means converting raw goods to inventory and selling the product more quickly to reduce the amount of cash tied up in the manufacturing process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the context of the credit crunch, companies are particularly focusing on reducing idle cash balances and extending payment terms offered to suppliers. In China, this can be achieved most effectively using techniques such as cash pooling and trade finance.</p>
<h5 id="cash-pooling">Cash pooling</h5>
<p>In a cash pooling arrangement, cash is swept to/from several accounts from/to one header account, enabling the company to optimise interest and use any idle cash more effectively. The sub accounts are left with a balance of zero or a specified target balance. In China, due to the restrictions on inter-company lending, cash pooling must be carried out using an entrust loan structure. This means that a bank must act as an intermediary.</p>
<p>As Tim Fleming explains, “In a tighter liquidity environment, cash pooling becomes a much higher priority as companies seek to fully utilise all cash resources within the group to reduce their external funding needs.” There may also be opportunities for companies already using such a structure to use it more effectively. For example, it may be possible to increase the number of legal entities participating in the structure and to make sure that all existing participants fully utilise the pool and leave no idle balances elsewhere.</p>
<p>In China, multinational corporations have sometimes found it difficult to persuade joint venture partners to participate in a cash pool as the JV partner may wish to keep any surplus cash. If the joint venture partner is short of cash, on the other hand, they may be more willing to participate as they would be set to benefit from having their cash deficit covered by the header account.</p>
<p>Historically companies have been reserved when it comes to negotiating with JV partners. However, in the current market the benefits of incorporating as many entities as possible into the structure may outweigh the difficulties involved in negotiating terms.</p>
<p>Another possible stumbling block to setting a new cash pool is the reluctance to concentrate cash balances onto one bank as this may have an impact on the legal entities’ banking relationships. This needs to be carefully considered, particularly when liquidity is scarce. However, for many the benefits of an effective cash pooling structure will be very attractive.</p>
<h5 id="third-party-entrust-loans">Third party entrust loans</h5>
<p>A third party entrust loan is a loan arranged between two companies with a bank acting as intermediary. The advantage of this form of funding is that the interest rates are not regulated. However, in practice this type of loan can be difficult to achieve as it is necessary to find one company that is looking to borrow a particular amount and match them with a lender who is comfortable with the counterparty and looking to lend the same amount and tenor. While there has been significant interest in this type of arrangement and a small numbers of companies have been active lenders it has not been widely adopted.</p>

<figure class="portrait left"><img alt="Portrait of Sherwin Zhang" class="photo" height="150" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/2008/11and12/2008-11-ttc-08-bb-sherwin-zhang-100x150.jpg" width="100"/></figure>

<p><em>Headquartered in Basel, Switzerland, Novartis is a global leader in innovative pharmaceuticals, vaccines and consumer health products. Novartis entered the China market in 1987 and has enjoyed rapid growth since then, establishing five manufacturing companies, one R&amp;D entity, two trading companies and several representative offices to date. Annual sales in China for 2007 totalled $370m and the company’s forecast growth rate for 2008 is around 30%.</em></p>
<p>The growth of Novartis’ business units in China has been rapid but also challenging, largely due to strong sales growth and the challenging macroeconomic environment. Recently, the situation has become more complex with tighter government policies coming into force and the impact of the credit crunch starting to filter through. Although Novartis’ treasury operations in China were not directly affected by the global liquidity squeeze, banks in the region have found themselves under pressure, which has in turn negatively impacted the range of services available to corporates, particularly in relation to financing.</p>
<p>Novartis China has found the tighter monetary policies particularly challenging as the company aims to use its working capital as efficiently as possible. “We don’t keep extra cash in our bank accounts, so we rely on an overdraft to meet the temporary financing need arising from our daily operation,” says Sherwin Zhang, country treasurer of Novartis in China. “I heard that some companies have taken bank loans and kept the cash idle in their account, or made some structured deposits in case they need funding. Like a bear that eats a lot in the autumn to prepare for hibernating in the winter, this is a practical solution for weathering the tightening controls. However, we won’t adopt such a strategy as it reduces the cash efficiency dramatically and is against our treasury guidelines. So the challenge is tougher for us.”</p>
<p>Novartis China divides its funding requirements into long- and short-term, with the long-term funding need usually being covered by capital injection and/or shareholder loans. Instead of opting for a one-off infusion of funds, Novartis bases its needs on the cash flow forecast to ensure there is no idle cash in the company bank accounts. For short-term financing needs, meanwhile, an overdraft is used to support the domestic zero balancing cash pool, which was set up in 2006 through Citi. “The core part of Citi’s services is the integrated cash management system based on cash pooling and e-banking, which helps a lot in our treasury management,” says Zhang. “We selected Citi as our main bank because it has the most mature and stable cash management system.”</p>
<p>All of the company’s Chinese business units participate in the cash pool, which has reduced the company’s external borrowing requirements and improved its cash efficiency. “Cash flow forecasting can give us a picture of working capital and help us to plan, but only with the cash pool arrangement can we manage our cash in a very sophisticated way and control and move our cash daily rather than on a weekly or monthly basis,” explains Zhang. “Speaking of cash flow forecasting, it’s an extremely important tool to monitor working capital, but it cannot always be accurate. Many companies almost give up due to the inaccuracy of it and keep a large cash buffer instead. Only with the flexibility offered by cash pooling can we rely more on our cash flow forecast and keep the cash balance at a minimum level.”</p>
<p>As the company’s consolidated cash position is kept close to zero in order to maximise cash efficiency, traditional term loans no longer meet Novartis China’s needs. The company previously undertook inter-company entrusted loans but planning these required a great deal of time and energy. Meanwhile, from time to time the loans had to be rescheduled due to fluctuations in working capital, which raised the cost of this form of funding. Novartis China has never engaged in third party entrusted loan arrangements as these were deemed too inflexible.</p>
<p>On a global level, Novartis undertakes FX settlement activities such as cross-border netting and monthly inter-company reconciliation. However, netting is not allowed in China. Since these intragroup payments must be received and made on a gross in gross out basis on a very strict schedule, execution of the outgoing FX payments puts a lot of pressure on the Novartis Accounts Payable teams in China, due to the supporting documents requirements. Citi is one of Novartis’ FX settlement banks and Zhang appreciates the bank’s value-added service, particularly as the company is currently preparing for the new regulations, which will affect FX cash flows.</p>
<p>As such, the company continues to monitor new products and industry trends in order to avoid any surprises in its treasury management. Although Novartis China conducts most of its international trade with group companies, much time has been spent studying how trade finance techniques such as bank acceptance drafts and supply chain finance can be used to optimise working capital. Zhang concludes, “Trade finance will not be the key part of our strategy as the flexibility of funding is the essential aspect of our cash management and working capital control, but it’s an option for diversifying our funding resources.”</p>

<h4 id="trade-finance-techniques">Trade finance techniques</h4>
<p>Trade finance techniques may also be employed to smooth out the company’s working capital cycle. Bank Accepted Drafts (BADs) and Commercially Accepted Drafts (CADs) are a common form of payment in China and they can be discounted in order to expedite accounts receivable.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>BADs are paper-based instruments which are guaranteed by the payer’s bank and passed to the seller, who presents the draft to their own bank for collection at the maturity date. Alternatively, the seller may choose to discount the draft in order to receive payment early on a with or without recourse basis. The minimum interest rate for discounting RMB drafts is currently set at 4.34% but in practice the rate may be 6% or more as it is market driven. In addition, the market rate has been particularly volatile this year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CADs are similar to BADs but they are guaranteed only by the buyer and not by the bank. The payment risk is therefore higher.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While BADs in particular are a popular means of mitigating counterparty risk, however, the banks may not always be willing to issue them depending on the customer’s creditworthiness.</p>
<h5 id="supply-chain-finance">Supply chain finance</h5>
<p>Another technique which has attracted much discussion in China and worldwide is supply chain financing. This is a type of receivables discounting but unlike other techniques, such as factoring, it is initiated by the buyer. Finance is provided to small suppliers at a better rate than they could otherwise obtain, based on the credit rating of their more creditworthy customers.</p>
<p>From the point of view of the customer, this technique is often used to alleviate pressure on suppliers when payment terms are increased. Longer payment terms, while beneficial to the buyer, can be problematic for suppliers. This in turn can cause the buyer difficulties if the supplier is obliged to raise its prices or even goes out of business. By offering suppliers supply chain financing, MNCs can improve their own working capital position without damaging that of their suppliers and at the same time enhance the relationship they have with their suppliers. The accounting treatment of supply chain financing techniques can however be ambiguous from the point of view of the supplier. Companies may wish to move the financing arrangement off balance sheet but this is usually only possible if the arrangement is carried out without recourse. Accounting advice should be sought to ensure the correct treatment.</p>

<p>While China’s economy remains strong, there continues to be a heavy reliance on exports. As a result, the exchange rate is of critical importance in ensuring that exports are priced at an attractive rate. Measures taken to relieve inflationary pressure and cool the economy, such as higher interest rates, run the risk of also contributing to currency appreciation. When combined with a global downturn, this could have a larger than desired impact on the country’s exports. Most recently, the Chinese regulator has halted RMB appreciation and moved towards a loosening of monetary policy. However, credit remains scarce as a result of the global financial crisis and economic woes.</p>
<h4 id="lessons-for-the-future">Lessons for the future</h4>
<p>Many were unprepared for the current credit crunch and its repercussions, and as a result there are lessons that can be learnt for the future.</p>
<p>One of the things that treasurers will look to achieve going forward is a more effective match between the company’s funding requirements and its lines of credit. According to Citi’s Tim Fleming, “Companies have not always had properly matched tenor requirements. They have been using short-term borrowing for long-term needs, which puts them in a vulnerable position. If the bank says you have to reduce your overdraft, it is difficult if the funds have been spent on capital equipment. The key is to plan ahead.”</p>
<p>In addition, the credit crunch has brought about a greater focus on the need for committed facilities. Before the crisis, in a very liquid market, companies were more relaxed in arranging lines of credit. With liquidity scarcer, companies are more likely to enter into committed facilities, preferring to pay a premium and have a firm arrangement in place.</p>
