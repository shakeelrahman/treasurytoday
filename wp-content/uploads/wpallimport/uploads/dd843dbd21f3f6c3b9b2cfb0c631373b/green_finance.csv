<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>Corporate treasury teams can no longer ignore the pressure to issue green debt and use the proceeds for sustainable endeavour. The green bond market is still only a fraction of the total debt capital market but has grown from almost nothing a decade ago to roughly €660bn today and is forecast to hit €2trn by the end of 2023, according to research by NN Investment Partners.</p>
<p>Issuing green debt allows treasury teams to tap a growing pool of investor demand as pension funds and asset managers increasingly seek to integrate ESG across their portfolios and position for economies turning carbon neutral and aligning with the Paris goals. The latest innovation around pricing in the evolving market is allowing treasury teams to tap diversified and sticky investors and cheapen their cost of borrowing, while green issuance is also a powerful communication tool, boosting corporate brands amongst key stakeholders. It is more time-consuming than traditional corporate issuance and involves collaboration across the company as well as long conversations with banking partners that go beyond simple distribution. But the rewards, in every sense, are worth it.</p>
<p>The sustainable debt market took a significant leap forward in 2019 when Italian energy giant Enel, already a renowned issuer of green debt, put together the first ever Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) linked step-up bond. In the innovative structure the cost of borrowing rises if the company fails to meet key KPIs around the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. The concept is a leap for treasury teams contemplating green issuance for the first time, but Alessandro Canta, Enel’s Head of Finance and Insurance at Enel, passionately believes others can follow.</p>
<h3 id=""governance"">Governance</h3>
<p>Enel’s journey only began in earnest in 2016. It started with key commitments like a board-level pledge for the company to become a benchmark in the green bond market. A Green Bond Framework, where the company outlined how it would use green proceeds in line with the 2018 Capital Markets Association Green Bond Principles followed. Elsewhere, Enel set up a new Green Bond Committee to internally track the use of proceeds and impact from its green debt issuance. “We wanted to get the governance, framework and procedures to attract investors right,” recalls Canta, who says raising money was never the priority of the process.</p>
<p>These early steps became bolder following the company’s pledge to help achieve the United Nations SDGs like combating climate change, building sustainable cities and fostering inclusive economic growth. Linking the company’s financing strategy to these overarching goals and seeking investment to finance this broad SDG strategy rather than a subset of projects linked to traditional green bond issuance, was an obvious evolution. “We started to ask ourselves if there was another thing other than green bonds that would fit with this objective,” says Canta.</p>
<p>Developing the concept and product internally took months. “There is a certain amount of reputational risk with creating a new instrument; we had to check the validity of the idea,” he says. Once the board was comfortable with the concept internally, the team started to consult its banks and corporate peers in the UN Global Compact, the voluntary corporate sustainability initiative. Roadshows with US investors ahead of the company’s inaugural SDG-linked five-year US$1.5bn bond followed. “We chose US investors over European counterparts for our first SDG-linked bond because they have a reputation for being more receptive to new ideas. The traditional green bond market is more established in Europe – there is more of a legacy, and this was a new idea.” It wasn’t long until a euro-denominated issue for European investors followed, however.</p>
<h3 id=""kpis"">KPIs</h3>
<p>KPIs and a so-called step-up lie at the heart of the bond structure. KPIs decree Enel achieve at least 55% of its total electricity capacity from renewable sources by the end of 2021 compared to 46% as of 30th June 2019. Enel’s auditor will gauge performance during its annual audit and if the company misses the target, its annual interest payment will step up by 25 basis points offering a reward to investors.</p>
<p>Daniel Weiss, Deputy Group Treasurer at pharmaceutical giant Novartis, which became the second corporate to follow Enel’s lead when it issued a sustainable bond with a coupon step-up in September 2020, agrees that robust KPIs were crucial in attracting investor interest to its €1.85bn issue. Interest payments rise if the company fails to expand access to medicines and programmes to combat malaria, leprosy, sickle cell disease and chagas in a number of developing countries in a KPI structure that took six months to shape and drew on ICMA guidelines on sustainable bond principles.</p>
<h3 id=""the-value-of-sustainability"">The value of sustainability</h3>
<p>Success doesn’t only depend on ensuring a robust KPI. Enel, selling the concept for the first time back in 2019, had to convince market participants that the company deserved a lower cost of funding if it meets its KPI because sustainability has a value. “Meeting our KPI makes the company more resilient, profitable and less risky in the long term. If you can prove all these things, then we deserve a lower cost of debt. If we don’t respect the KPI we are less sustainable, riskier and investors deserve a premium.”</p>
<p>Weiss, however, remains cautious of the ability of sustainable companies to attract cheaper funding, given that highly rated companies in leading industries can already price bonds at very attractive levels. “Incremental pricing improvements are hard at these levels and the pricing was probably more or less the same, but this wasn’t our primary goal.”</p>
<p>Indeed, a key aim for all corporates venturing into the green debt market is attracting a wider investor base. Ambitious sustainable issuance allows companies to tap the fast-growing cohort of ESG investors. “Our investor base in this bond is slightly different from the investors we usually see in our bond issues,” confirms Wiess, who counsels others that his team relied more than usual on banking partner J.P. Morgan to help shape key elements of the bond to meet investor appetite. “The market is not established, and we relied on the bank more than we do for our other issues.”</p>
<p>These sentiments are echoed by German car maker Daimler’s Head of Treasury Kurt Schäfer, whose team (working with Swedish bank SEB) sold the company’s first €1bn traditional green bond in September in anticipation of a sharp pick up in investor appetite for green debt. “We expect increasing interest in green financing in Europe backed by the EU Green Deal, the changing regulatory landscape and the recent issuance of a green bond by the German government. We expect green financing to become mainstream and indispensable mid- to long term.”</p>
<p>For Enel, marketing the step-up concept for the first time, convincing rounds of investor panels, conferences and bank syndicate desks of its merits was a longer haul, particularly given the debt market still lags the equity market’s appreciation and engagement on sustainability. However, Canta argues, the process is testimony to how the green bond market is evolving to combat the dangers of corporate greenwashing and that investors are increasingly driving the conversation.</p>
<p>During capital rounds treasury teams and their advisers are asking for cash. It forces corporates to listen to investor feedback, adapt their strategies and make green promises. “We had in-depth conversations with banks’ sustainability teams to explain the company’s commitment to the SDGs and the story around the KPI. We needed them on board,” says Canta, adding that European debt investors are a particularly tough nut to crack. “We had one gruelling investor meeting with a very skilled sustainable team. It lasted over an hour and a half with challenging questions about our numbers and approach. They did invest.”</p>
<h3 id=""investor-demand"">Investor demand</h3>
<p>Breakthroughs came when Enel convinced banks that its SDG-linked bond wasn’t a one-off, tailor- made issue but represented a new asset class to help sustainability go mainstream. The fact that green bonds still only account for 2-3% of the global capital markets underscores the urgent need to funnel more money into sustainable endeavour, says Canta who stresses that SDG-linked bonds and new step-up coupons complement the existing green bond market and should not be viewed as a competing instrument. “We were always convinced this instrument had the possibility to become an asset class. Now other companies have followed us, the ICMA has issued principles and the European Central Bank has finally recognised this instrument universally as an asset class,” he says.</p>
<p>Canta also notes that investor enthusiasm for the structure spiked when they saw the issue in the context of Enel’s wider sustainable strategy. It’s a point Samantha Sutcliffe, Head of Green and Sustainable Finance at UBS echoes, pointing to the growing investor enthusiasm for corporate transition stories. “Investors are keen to support companies that are not necessarily 100% green today but have a decarbonisation strategy beyond business as usual in place.”</p>
<h3 id=""advice"">Advice</h3>
<p>As for advice to others considering more complex green structures, treasury experts counsel on the importance of setting up a high-level corporate-wide team to knit the process together. At Novartis, alignment between the internal and external legal teams to ensure the language was clear in the bond prospectus around how the coupon step is tied to the KPI was a priority. “We had to align the whole organisation to stand behind those KPIs. It’s substantially different from the usual bond and takes time to put in place,” says Weiss.</p>
<p>Similarly, Sutcliff highlights the new and often hidden benefits of corporate treasury teams working much more closely with their sister sustainability departments. “Green bonds are a vehicle to enhance internal discussions,” she says. “Such cross-department discussions can lead to strategies being revised and targets changed or met quicker than initially set out.” She also reassures rooky green issuers that most of the information they need to write a Green Bond Framework, that first document on the road to green issuance, will be found within the corporate organisation. “Often Sustainability departments will have the data and methodologies required to define green activities and support the governance of the green bond framework. It could be that such information is not always publicly available but tends nevertheless to be within the company.”</p>
<p>Experts flag key challenges to scaling up the market on the road ahead. Market participants are unanimous in their call to rating agencies to integrate quantitative metrics with sustainability so investors can see a companies’ green trajectory. While Enel’s Canta urges banks to charge less to lend to sustainable companies to fuel the market beyond just bond issuance. “If it is valid for the bond market, as we have shown, it has to be valid for the banking system too,” he says, adding that Enel has also changed its commercial paper programme to attract more sustainable investors. As for Weiss, he is convinced that ambitious KPIs lying at the heart of new step-up structures will both propel corporate sustainability and attract investors in a win-win, virtuous circle. “Companies should push the boundaries of what they define as green or social,” he concludes.</p></div>

<p>In 2020, environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations have become more important than ever for organisations despite – or perhaps because of – the widespread and continuing impact of the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>But while this topic is becoming ever more critical for companies, and for their internal and external stakeholders, it is not always clear how best to embed ESG and sustainability considerations into the treasury, and across the organisation as a whole.</p>
<p>With this in mind, a recent Treasury Today virtual roundtable with Bank of America took a comprehensive look at how different organisations are tackling this area, and what treasurers need to be aware of in this evolving market. Speakers from Flex, JetBlue, Ferguson, ENGIE Impact and Bank of America discussed their experiences of ESG and sustainability initiatives, explained how the COVID-19 crisis has further shaped this topic, and shared their insights into the steps treasurers should be taking.</p>
<h4 id=""understanding-the-basics"">Understanding the basics</h4>
<p>While the term ESG is widely used, it can also mean different things to different people. As such, Sophie Jackson, Publisher &amp; Head of Strategic Content at Treasury Today, began the discussion by inviting panellists to share their thoughts on what ESG means to them.</p>
<p>Anita Bubna, Senior Director Treasury at Flex, the global technology, supply chain and manufacturing partner, said that initially she had been more focused on the environmental aspect of ESG and had not realised how broad the scope of ESG really is. Then, in 2016, Flex set 20 ESG-related goals through 2020 that focus on five cornerstones, including people, community, environment, innovation and integrity. The cornerstones span health and safety, employee development, community engagement, environmental stewardship as well as ethics, compliance and anti-corruption activities, among other areas.</p>
<p>Bubna also shared the steps she has taken to shift her treasury team into a more ESG-focused mindset – a process that she started by reading a 100-page sustainability report to understand what the company had been doing in this area. “I had to understand which metrics we should target,” she commented, adding that this included ensuring that any chosen KPIs would be strategic for the business and focused on areas of importance to stakeholders, as well as being easily verified and measured by third parties.</p>
<p>Jeff Waller, Senior Director, Head of Financing Solutions at sustainability and energy management company ENGIE Impact, commented that companies are increasingly thinking about their internal and external stakeholders, all of whom are taking a broader view when evaluating a company. “So they’re not just looking at operations and financial returns – they’re starting to look at environmental footprint, diversity and inclusion, governance – all those different questions.”</p>
<h4 id=""flavours-of-sustainable-finance"">Flavours of sustainable finance</h4>
<p>Where sustainable financing is concerned, Waller said that it can be helpful to think about sustainable finance in two ‘buckets’. “One is called use of proceeds, whereby you get a bond or issue a loan, and the proceeds have to go to eligible projects,” he explained. “Then there are sustainability-linked loans and bonds, which really look at a company from a holistic perspective.” For example, he said, a company might need to demonstrate progress on a chosen KPI, such as improving renewable energy consumption, in order to avoid a financial penalty.</p>
<p>And Henrik Lang, Global Head of Liquidity at Bank of America (BofA), spoke about how the bank is working to bring its trade finance solution set into treasury conversations. He noted: “One of the things we can do as a bank provider is give powerful tools to corporates so they can categorise their suppliers based on a certain set of ESG criteria and differentiate between financing terms.” Lang added that this provides an incentive to suppliers to improve their own ESG metrics, thereby extending the ESG focus across the whole ecosystem.</p>
<h4 id=""esg-in-action"">ESG in action</h4>
<p>Despite the severe impact of the global pandemic on the airline industry, Sara Bogdan, Manager Sustainability &amp; ESG at US based airline JetBlue, gave an inspiring account of the airline’s achievements in tackling sustainability. She noted that while the ‘flight shaming movement’ has subsided somewhat this year given the sudden reduction in travel, “when travel rebounds, we expect that conversation will come right back. And we agree – we think people love to travel, but nobody likes the emissions that come with it.”</p>
<p>Consequently, the company has taken action to address this. “This year, we have become the first and only US airline to achieve carbon neutrality for domestic travel, which is about 80% of our emissions,” said Bogdan. She explained that this has been achieved through a major carbon offsetting initiative, as well as the announcement that the airline would begin using sustainable aviation fuel on regular flights out of San Francisco International Airport. “So our strategy is to maintain carbon neutrality as we go forward, but ramp down what we require from carbon offsets as we build up renewable resources and continue to have more fuel-efficient operations.”</p>
<p>Turning to the rise of working from home driven by COVID-19, Bubna said that Flex had rolled out a survey to employees to help decide what the new workplace should look like. “We also launched an application to help employees self-assess for COVID-related symptoms. Based on anonymous, employee responses, the tool provides guidance and adds another safety layer,” she said. Indeed, Bubna said that the health and safety of employees remains a top priority for the company, with rigorous processes in place – particularly for employees who continue to work in factories.</p>
<p>Royston Da Costa, Assistant Group Treasurer at specialist distributor of plumbing and heating products Ferguson, added that the rise of working from home had resulted in considerable environmental benefits in terms of the amount of pollution generated by commuters. He also noted that this is fuelling the conversation surrounding whether the employees of the future will need to be based in specific geographical locations.</p>
<p>“At Ferguson, and certainly in treasury, all our systems are cloud based, so we can pretty much work remotely as we navigate through this pandemic,” he added. “The one aspect is the social interaction, which we’re addressing as we go along.” Da Costa cited some of the initiatives that Ferguson has introduced, including a gender diversity initiative, that allow staff to engage with topics remotely and build their social awareness.</p>
<h4 id=""sharing-knowledge"">Sharing knowledge</h4>
<p>BofA’s Lang returned to the theme of education, noting that the bank has launched a new framework called ESG Meter, which focuses on understanding the role that ESG criteria play in the valuation of certain companies. “In addition, we’re doing a whole host of other things – we regularly host podcasts where we talk about the most recent ESG challenges our clients face and how they’re approaching them,” he said. “We are also doing some grassroots type activities where we spend a lot of time sitting down with corporates one-on-one and helping them turn their treasury departments into sustainable operations.”</p>
<p>Waller, meanwhile, noted that ESG “is not an area ripe for corporate espionage,” but that corporations that are early movers in this space are actively drawing attention to their activities. What’s more, early movers are not only happy to share their experiences, but also see this as a sign of leadership in the ESG space. “I would encourage folks to take advantage of that, because it’s a great way to learn,” he added.</p>
<h4 id=""impact-of-the-pandemic"">Impact of the pandemic</h4>
<p>Returning to the impact of the pandemic and working on the sustainability conversation, Bogdan reflected that while 2020 has been JetBlue’s most challenging financial year by far, “it has also been our most accomplished in sustainability.” In January, the firm announced its plans to become the first carbon neutral US airline for domestic flights, with a planned launch of July 1st – “and then, of course, everything changed in our industry in that time.” But despite the additional challenges brought by the pandemic, the firm’s leadership remained committed to this goal.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Lang said that despite this year’s market volatility, “one asset class that consistently performed better throughout the year is ESG funds – they have seen increased inflows, and also their returns seem to be a little more resistant, and not as volatile, as some of the other asset classes.” Looking forward, he predicted that in ten years’ time “I don’t think we’re going to be talking about green bonds and normal bonds – I think any bond issuance will also need sustainable goals or social goals.”</p>
<p>Bubna noted that another thing that needs to happen is greater collaboration between governments, NGOs, corporates and academia in order to drive holistic solutions. “And another step for corporates to take is aligning their programmes with broader initiatives like the UN sustainability goals, so they’re all working towards matters that are pressing and will move the needle.”</p>
<p>Waller pointed out that this year, the spotlight has really been on the ‘S’ in ESG. “‘E’ has always taken prominence and was typically the one that got the most attention – it used to be that green bond issuance far eclipsed social bond issuance, until this year when the pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement have led to more of a focus on the ‘S’.”</p>
<p>And as Da Costa said, being at home has also led to a heightened focus on pressing environmental concerns (that have begun to hit mainstream agenda) like global warming. He also pointed out that one of the benefits of the pandemic has been that “the banks have finally come on board with digitised documents – we are now absolutely digitising everything we do in treasury.”</p>
<h4 id=""the-future-of-esg"">The future of ESG</h4>
<p>Jackson asked panellists to reflect on the future of ESG, and the factors that need to change in order for more progress to be made. JetBlue’s Bogdan said that from a corporate perspective, people are no longer accepting “vague long-term targets” – rather than setting goals for 2050, investors, customers and crew members are asking what the company is doing today.</p>
<p>“In order to keep this momentum going, different stakeholders need to come to the different organisations and demand meaningful change across all ESG topics,” she added. “And behind the scenes, we’re looking at meaningful programmes: how do we increase our sustainable aviation fuel supply? How do we look at our diversity metrics within our workforce? And how do we improve that bridge to our leadership for our racially diverse crew members? And then, how do we make all this public and report on it?”</p>
<p>Bubna emphasised the need for education and having clear metrics. “There’s a lot of data, but unless that data is standardised and structured so that investors can make use of it, it doesn’t help,” she added. Pointing out that companies currently in the early stages of this can learn from those that have gone before, she emphasised Flex’s willingness to share its learnings with other companies.</p>
<p>Collaboration should mean working not just with other companies, but also engagement with the local community, argued Da Costa: “You’ve got to start where you are, in my view – it doesn’t matter how large your company is, or where you’re based.”</p>
<p>And Waller spoke about the impact of the next generation coming into the workforce. “For a lot of companies, one of the key stakeholder groups that are pushing their sustainability agendas is internal,” he said. “The younger generation are demanding more accountability from their leadership on things like social justice, environmental sustainability and others. And as these folks ascend to more leadership positions, this will get more entrenched.”</p>
<h4 id=""education-and-resources"">Education and resources</h4>
<p>The conversation returned to the importance of education and the types of resources that corporates can draw upon. BofA’s Lang pointed out that the challenge with ESG is there is no textbook that has all the answers. “My number one advice would be to speak with your banking providers and challenge them – they interact with a lot of corporates in your industry and outside of your industry, and they can share insights that you can draw on.” He also emphasised the importance of taking a holistic approach to ESG within the treasury department, including defining goals, pre-planning, implementation and monitoring metrics.</p>
<p>Da Costa cited the example of a cyber fraud initiative started by one of the company’s UK banking partners – “It’s an area that most treasury functions and companies have been very shy about.” However, banks and companies have become increasingly willing to discuss this topic openly. ESG, likewise, is an area where banks can be “great facilitators” when it comes to engaging their customers, he added.</p>
<h4 id=""reporting-and-accountability"">Reporting and accountability</h4>
<p>Turning to the importance of embedding ESG into every part of an organisation, Bogdan talked about how JetBlue has integrated ESG into the company’s enterprise risk management system – “that’s something that is established, is reported to the board, and also has a whole audit department that’s tracking it.” Actions like this have made sure that ESG is a permanent and significant part of the company’s larger leadership structure – “you can’t lose sight of it.”</p>
<p>Where market developments are concerned, Waller cited the recent launch of the UN Global Compact CFO Taskforce for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). “Essentially the goal is to create guidelines and best practices for CFOs and finance teams on how to set meaningful SDG targets, integrate them into their corporate finance activities, and report their progress to investors and the public.”</p>
<p>Da Costa also noted the importance of accountability to managers, the board and shareholders, as well as to society and the economy in which companies operate. “One way of doing that is to belong to an index where your metrics are being measured,” he said, adding that Ferguson is part of the FTSE 100’s 30% Club, which was set up to achieve a minimum of 30% female representation on FTSE 100 boards. Da Costa explained that regulation has helped Companies to accelerate the speed of such driven gender diversity progress on their company’s board.</p>
<p>“There’s only one trajectory that we’re all going on in terms of the way that the world is evolving – but it’s also about getting it sooner rather than later!” he added.</p>
<h4 id=""closing-words"">Closing words</h4>
<p>Summing up the conversation, Jackson noted that participants had highlighted a number of important points: “People need to begin looking at the data they’ve got on this; holding themselves accountable; collaborating not just within their company but within the industry, and not being afraid to share challenges and weaknesses, because that’s how everybody’s going to learn. If everyone sits in a silo trying to solve this on their own, nothing is going to change,” she concluded.</p>

<p>Systematically including or considering ESG data as part of an investment process is becoming an increasingly critical component to investors’ investment decisions. But approaches to assessing what ESG really means in the context of a portfolio have often been subjective, until now.</p>
<p>We have seen various methods of including ESG considerations in an investment portfolio. Traditional exclusionary screening strategies continue to be used, removing particular companies, sectors or countries that do not align with a particular set of values. We’ve also seen clients adopt a thematic approach, concentrating on a particular area, such as climate.</p>
<p>Another focus has been on ESG ‘best-in-class’ strategies, where investment in sectors or companies are selected for their apparent superior ESG performance, relative to their respective universe or industry peers. Others have adopted an ESG integration approach, where ESG factors are integrated as part of the investment process which has led to an increase in demand for 100% ESG-aware portfolios.</p>
<p>To reflect this goal, in July 2019 we launched the State Street ESG Liquid Reserve (ELR) fund, a prime money market fund investing in instruments that meet our ESG criteria.</p>
<p>Knowing that cash management plays a critical role in our clients’ investment portfolios, we overcame some pressing challenges in implementing material ESG criteria across ELR. But we met those challenges by creating a unique solution to the problem of assessing the ESG components of a portfolio’s underlying assets.</p>
<h4 id=""new-drivers"">New drivers</h4>
<p>The degree of client engagement in portfolio construction depends on individual ESG drivers. The relevant motivator influences the approach taken. But one thing is certain: whilst an exclusionary approach is still favoured by some investors, others are becoming proactive as they seek to bring cash into their ESG portfolio. These investors understand that it’s about more than just ‘doing the right thing’. They know that it actually matters, and are now insisting on inclusionary screening.</p>
<p>Various barriers have existed for some potential ESG investors. Where, for example, a fiduciary duty is imposed, it has kept some from adopting ESG implementation due to perceived hinderance on returns. But there is now growing recognition that mitigating ESG risk actually aligns with fiduciary duty and may provide better risk-adjusted returns. Our clients are focused on maintaining their primary objectives while incorporating ESG criteria.</p>
<p>In a money market fund, principal preservation and liquidity are paramount while earning a competitive yield. Our clients are looking to achieve these goals while achieving ESG objectives.</p>
<h4 id=""data-challenge"">Data challenge</h4>
<p>Across all asset classes, the lack of reliable and consistent ESG data has kept investors from implementing ESG considerations to their investment process. Numerous third parties provide ESG ratings using proprietary methodologies, with varying degrees of transparency. Assessments of a single company can produce wildly different results, so for the sustainability-focused investor, adopting positive screening methods is a problem.</p>
<p>Additionally, relative to other asset classes, integrating ESG considerations into a publicly traded cash strategy presents unique challenges. Money market funds face regulatory and investor-driven requirements to maintain high levels of liquidity and security. These funds primarily hold sovereign debt and securities issued by high quality large banks and financial institutions which leads to a concentration of 35 or so AA- or A-rated global banks that access the market daily.</p>
<p>In applying an unrefined ESG filter, the exclusionary approach would further limit that investible pool – potentially increasing fund concentration risk.</p></div>
</div>
<div class=""v-spacing--bottom quote-block"" style="""">
<blockquote>
<p>Building on our transparent R-Factor scoring system, we are proud to offer one of the asset management industry’s most comprehensive and innovative solutions for ESG-focused cash management.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class=""v-spacing--bottom"">
<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body"">
<p>Additionally, prime money market funds may also hold asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) and repurchase agreements secured by non-government collateral (referred to as alternative repo). However, evaluation of the ESG performance of the repo bank counterparty or ABCP liquidity provider does not reveal the full factors at work for satisfactory inclusion in a client’s ESG mandate. The underlying collateral needs analysis. But for any asset manager, performing satisfactory reviews of this collateral is often subject to limited internal resources and expertise and, most challengingly, a lack of reliable and transparent ESG data.</p>
<p>There are challenges, but that doesn’t mean investors need to ignore sustainability factors in their cash management strategies. We are committed to solving these challenges, and we have dedicated a significant amount of research and resources to creating a cash management solution built on a unique and dynamic ESG scoring, screening and tilting process.</p>
<h4 id=""meet-r-factor"">Meet R-Factor™</h4>
<p>In response to the data challenge, State Street Global Advisors has developed a transparent ESG scoring system called R-Factor (where ‘R’ is Responsibility). Leveraging multiple data sources (including Sustainalytics, ISS-ESG, Vigeo-EIRIS, and ISSGovernance), and SASB’s financial materiality framework, R-Factor generates a unique score for individual companies.</p>
<p>R-Factor was built to solve the data quality problem, and to remove opaqueness around ESG materiality in the scoring process. It measures the performance of a company’s business operations and governance as it relates to financially material ESG issues facing the company’s industry. Importantly, each score is dynamically adjusted as each element changes.</p>
<p>We are seeing more investors appreciate that ESG considerations influence the sustainability of returns in all asset classes. For investors, R-Factor offers a standardised, bias-free and comparable view of the ESG components that focus on the financially material ESG issues shown to impact companies’ long-term performance. In doing so, it is opening up our clients’ corporate cash management strategies to the full and transparent incorporation of ESG factors.</p>
<p>By excluding a small subset of instruments and issuers involved in controversial practices or those that lack necessary transparency, ELR provides 100% coverage of our stated ESG criteria. By applying a sophisticated tilting process that assesses the R-Factor scores of the issuing counterparty — and, for ABCP and certain types of alternative repo, giving consideration to the underlying collateral — we can provide our clients with a scalable ESG cash management strategy that achieves investors’ objectives.</p>
<p>As ESG-centric money market products continue to be introduced in the marketplace, we believe that State Street Global Advisors is uniquely positioned to solve these challenges. Building on our transparent R-Factor scoring system, we are proud to offer one of the asset management industry’s most comprehensive and innovative solutions for ESG-focused cash management.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>Green bonds are the most prized possession of the green finance industry – proven to be a key financial instrument which enables billions of dollars to flow into sustainable infrastructure across the globe.</p>
<p>Since the first green bond was issued by the World Bank in November 2008, the market has grown exponentially. Over US$200bn in green bonds was issued last year, up from US$170bn in 2018, and demand is far outstripping supply.</p>
<p>But what exactly is a green bond, and what makes it ‘green’?</p>
<h3 id=""back-to-basics"">Back to basics</h3>
<p>Essentially, a green bond is a fixed-income instrument where proceeds or revenue streams connected to the bond are allocated for investment in new and existing ‘green projects’ which have environmental benefits.</p>
<p>More formally, the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) states green bonds are any type of bond instrument where the proceeds will be exclusively applied to finance or re-finance projects with clear environmental benefits and which are aligned with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles (GBP).</p>
<p>The ICMA’s GBP are effectively voluntary process guidelines that recommend transparency and disclosure, and promote integrity in the development of the green bond market by clarifying the approach for any issuance. The GBP provides issuers with guidance on the key components involved in launching a credible green bond.</p>
<p>There are four core principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use of proceeds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Process of project evaluation and selection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Management of proceeds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reporting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whilst all four are required for the characterisation of a green bond, the crucial element is the green project itself.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for a green project to be eligible, it should have an environmental objective, such as climate change mitigation, environmental conservation or pollution prevention. Green projects could also incorporate eco-efficient products, green buildings, biodiversity, conservation or clean transportation.</p>
<h3 id=""market-movers"">Market movers</h3>
<p>However, there remains a problem – namely that the lack of a universally-accepted global framework poses a risk to investors. Different market participants have different ways of quantifying sustainability, and different jurisdictions also have different regulations.</p>
<p>To take an example, the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI) database includes green bonds, but the criteria it users differs from those used by the GBP principles. It has also been known to reject some green bonds from its database, despite the bonds meeting the GBP and gaining approval from third-party reviewers. Some areas of the CBI’s Climate Bonds Taxonomy, which “aims to encourage and be an important resource for common green definitions across global markets”, have made some green bonds issued in China ineligible and excluded from the CBI’s database.</p>
<p>However, despite the lack of universal regulation in the sector, demand for green bonds has skyrocketed over the past 12 years across a wide range of sectors, including natural resources (oil and gas, renewable energy, mining and metals and chemicals), and transportation (airlines, shipping and automotives).</p>
<p>In October 2019, stock market operator Euronext, which operates in Amsterdam, Brussels, Dublin, Lisbon, London, Oslo and Paris, launched its three-year strategic plan, ‘Let’s Grow Together 2022’. In doing so, the group has put sustainability right at its heart, stating that it wants to strengthen its green bond offering and existing environmental, social and governance market indices.</p>
<p>With more than 44,000 bonds, Euronext is one of the world’s global leaders for bond listings, with approximately €118bn worth of green bonds listed on Euronext markets – €40bn of which was raised in the last 12 months. In order to be eligible for inclusion, all green bonds must be aligned with a recognisable industry standard such as ICMA’s GBP or CBI taxonomies, and must be accompanied by an appropriate external review performed by an independent third party.</p>
<p>October also saw the London Stock Exchange (LSE), which lists more than 200 green bonds since it opened up its green bond segment in 2015, create a new issuer-level section for bonds by issuers whose core business activity is aligned with the green economy. This development enables eligible green economy businesses with more than 90% green revenues to admit bonds to the sustainable bond market (SBM). The LSE also launched the Green Economy Mark, which recognises equity issuers with green revenues of 50% or more.</p>
<p>“We continue to see growing investor demand for actionable climate related financial information, with global asset allocations to green and sustainable finance increasing each year,” says Nikhil Rathi, Head of the LSE, in a press release. “The launch of the Sustainable Bond Market and the Green Economy Mark underlines our commitment to finding innovative solutions to support issuers and investors in the transition to a greener economy.”</p>
<h3 id=""being-seen-to-be-green"">Being seen to be green</h3>
<p>There are numerous reasons for this uptick in demand for green bonds and the response from the industry. Firstly, it goes without saying that the green bond label carries with it certain benefits, as in today’s climate ‘being seen to be green’ is high up on many companies’ agendas.</p>
<p>Environmental, social and governance (ESG) and/or socially responsible investors (SRI) have become buzzwords in recent years. And having green credentials, such as sustainability and the lowering of the business’s carbon footprint, plays well when it comes to attracting investment.</p>
<p>It’s a view held by Laurie Chesne, Green and Sustainable Assets Originator at French investment bank Natixis. “We carry out regular reviews and surveys in terms of ESG/SRI market intelligence, and this year we found that in Europe, around 50% of investors have really implemented SRI strategies within their investment strategy, and more than 60% of asset management in France is now performed in full ESG integration, which is pretty impressive compared to ten-15 years ago,” she says. “Whatever the sector – even in the high intensive industries – the interest in including sustainability as part of the business agenda is there and here to stay.”</p>

<p class=""source""><em>Source: Bloomberg – Global league table for corporate and government green bonds</em></p>
<h3 id=""the-nordic-charge"">The Nordic charge</h3>
<p>Sweden is leading the charge when it comes to the issuance of green bonds. Data from the CBI found that the country issued a massive US$8.26bn in green bonds last year, the equivalent to about half of the total issuance across the Nordic region. That’s considerably more than Norway (US$3bn), Finland (US$2.6bn), Denmark (US$2.4bn) and Iceland (US$115m).</p>
<p>A prime example as to why Sweden is the forerunner in the region is the Swedish bank SBAB. Back in 2015, the bank started offering green investment loans to corporate and tenant owner association clients.</p>
<p>With SBAB’s experience of the property market, in January 2019 the bank became the first institution in Sweden to issue a green covered bond, backed by residential mortgages and property loans. This issue totaled SEK6bn (US$6.2bn) and with demand outweighing supply, it was quickly oversubscribed.</p>
<p>So, as part of SBAB’s ambition to be a recurring issuer in the market for green bonds, six months later the bank then became the first institution in Sweden to issue a green senior non-preferred bond, which amounted to SEK3bn (US$3.1bn) and will mature in June 2024. Once again, demand far outweighed supply.</p>
<p>Axel Wallin, Head of Sustainability at SBAB, explains why the bank chose to venture into the green bond market in the first place. “Sustainability is integrated in our business targets and goals and is imperative for our future competitiveness and success,” he says. “Hence, energy efficiency and other green investments have to be integrated into all of our product offerings.”</p>
<p>According to Wallin, buildings account for almost 40% of all energy consumption in Sweden, so there is a great need for drastically reduced climate impact from housing. As such, developing green products like green bonds not only leads to new business opportunities, it also lowers both risk and credit loss.</p>
<p>“Our green bond issuances are part of a sustainable transition of the Swedish housing and real estate market,” Wallin says. “When the entire value chain becomes green, all the way from green mortgage loan taker to investor, the green demand from investors can actively push the housing market towards sustainability.”</p>
<p>He continues: “We see a strong and increasing trend in the demand for sustainable investments from existing and new investors, and being able to supply the market with sustainable or green bonds not only helps us meet that demand but also helps us diversify our investor base.”</p>
<h3 id=""moving-forward"">Moving forward</h3>
<p>Moving into 2020 and beyond, a key focus for SBAB is to continue to be the lead player in the Nordic green bond market. “Our aim is to continue to be a regular green bond issuer,” says Wallin. The bank is also currently looking at adding a resilience perspective to the categories too. “We can address physical climate related risks and create incentives for customers who invest in extra drainage, water pumps etc and this might also decrease risk for investors.”</p>
<p>Investment bank Natixis is also blazing a trail when it comes to the climate and sustainability agenda. “We have two key values at Natixis when it comes to sustainability, innovation and integrity,” explains Chesne. “As a cross-asset Green and Sustainable hub, we explore the opportunity to include green or sustainability dimensions in all of our financial products offered, not just bonds or loans, when relevant.”</p>
<p>Back in September, and following 18 months of work, Natixis launched a Green Weighting Factor for its financing deals. This means that all of the bank’s transactions are given a rating colour. “Because we want to implement sustainability at the heart of our everyday business, all of our transactions are rated according to a seven scale of assessment – from dark green to dark brown,” says Chesne. “The idea is not to solely focus on a dark green approach, but really cover all of our clients’ profiles and support their transition towards greener activities.”</p>
<p>Despite the popularity of green bonds in the market, many significant challenges remain. These include complexity and cost, the lack of green contractual protection for investors, transparency, quality of reporting metrics and issuer confusion and fatigue.</p>
<p>This fatigue has come about because of the multiplicity of the criteria, the boundless and ever-increasing sets of rules, the overlapping roles of some market players, disclosure reporting guidelines and the standards that issuers have to adhere to. These include both the ICMA and CBI, but also ratings agencies, stock exchanges, index providers, certifiers, disclosure reporting guidance and second party reviewers.</p>
<p>It’s therefore hardly surprising that issuers are confused, especially in the EU, where the proposed EU Green Bond Standard is something of a moving target. Back in May 2018, the European Commission (EC) proposed legislation to tackle what it called ‘greenwashing’, where banks and other companies claimed their investments were environmentally sound. Now the EC wants to go even further and decide, once and for all, what is and what is not ‘sustainable’.</p>
<p>“With credible and ambitious definitions for sustainable investment, the EU will lead the world in sustainable finance,” said Bas Eickhout, a Green Lawmaker at the EU.</p>
<h3 id=""arguing-the-case-for-issuance"">Arguing the case for issuance</h3>
<p>Emily Weng, green bond specialist in BlackRock’s fixed income group, explains further: “Standardisation is definitely at the heart of increasing investor confidence and acceptance of green bonds. Many green bonds follow the voluntary ICMA  guidelines in structure, but with varying standards in the current market, there are sometimes problematic cases of  what issuers identify as qualifying projects, more fondly referred to as ‘greenwashing’, that can be confusing for investors.”</p>
<p>Regulation in defining what does and does not qualify as a green bond is therefore essential. Weng sees the EU taxonomy proposal and the efforts towards conformity of different green bond standards as good forward momentum. “Increasing transparency from issuers will also help,” says Weng.</p>
<p>“Green bond investors are pushing both issuers and fund managers to publish environmental impact reports, highlight best practices and encourage greater transparency in the market. We want to see this market grow and we want to see new issuers joining – but when they do, we want to see them come to market with good green bond projects that will actually result in defensible positive environmental impact.”</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>It is a sentiment echoed by Chesne at Natixis: “The market is clearly growing year after year, and I think it will continue to grow,” says Chesne. “One of the major concerns however, remains standardisation and the lack of a common language. Clearly at the European level the market is evolving really fast and should the new EU Taxonomy and EU Green Bond Standard proposed by the Technical Expert Group come to pass, it will really help even more issuers identify the green assets that they have and frame their green bond structuration.”</p>
<p>An increasing amount of institutional investors however, do have well-defined and established green and sustainable investment guidelines. Chesne believes this will convince some new issuers to enter the market as they see more and more benefits, as well as economic benefits on the investor basis diversification and more indirectly on the pricing. We start to see some pricing benefits, not only in the secondary market but in the primary market too, especially for repeat issuers.</p>
<p>Industry bodies, as well as investor action groups such as Climate Action 100+, also have a role to play in driving the green market forward. Large market investors, including pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, are in a prime position too.</p>
<p>When all is said and done, the weight of demand for green bonds from institutional investors is only going to rise. As such, mindsets across the board will need to change accordingly – from politicians to regulators, and even corporates. Governments offering preferential rates or subsidies to issuers of green bonds is one development that could help. Should this happen, it will only attract more and more companies to issue green bonds and reap the rewards.</p>
<p>However, the most pressing need in the green bond arena moving forward isn’t just about having more issuers coming into the market – there also need to be enough bankable green projects to invest in, particularly when it comes to emerging markets. It is therefore vital that the whole financial system comes together to make the green bond market flourish.</p></div>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>Sustainable finance should definitely be a treasury priority and not just financing but all aspects of treasury should be assessed and challenged for their sustainability. This includes, in addition to financing, cash management and investments, choice of counterparties for treasury products, systems and suppliers in general.</p>
<p>We seek to demonstrate to our equity and debt investors our vision to not just clean up the Thames but to promote a change in the relationship between London (and Londoners) and their river and how the financing of such a large project can support that vision. Raising financing is at the core of the business and it made sense to align treasury activities to the business of the company. Tideway has issued six green bonds in the past two years for a total of £775m.</p>
<p>There is an increasing pool of investors with a sustainability mandate and environmental, social and governance (ESG) filters and all investors have an increased focus on integrating ESG factors into the investment process, which was facilitated by funding a green project like Tideway. Investors and other stakeholders also have greater transparency into a bond’s use of proceeds and get more information and reporting.</p>
<p>The bonds received significant internal and external recognition. The internal story is very positive as it made an example of successful cross-company collaboration. This turned on its head the additional work required to issue sustainable finance by harnessing collaboration with other areas – both sides develop a better understanding of the business, which provides risk mitigation too. It brought more integrated reporting to investors and, in the process, provided greater awareness of finance and investors’ requirements to colleagues in other areas. Finally, this collaborative process expanded the skill set of the treasury team and provided development opportunities.</p>
<p>Some of our shareholders have shown interest in using green bonds in their other projects. Externally, the bonds were covered by the specialised press and won a couple of awards. The government was delighted given its green financing strategy, added comments by two ministers to our press release and mentioned Tideway’s green bonds in its January 2018 25-year Plan to Improve the Environment.</p>
<p>Sustainable financing is at the centre of delivering the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Climate Agreement, but other areas of treasury are also important and increasingly coming up for scrutiny. Cash management and investments is one example: we have been discussing with our banks and money market funds how they apply ESG factors to their business as well as investigating sustainable product offering, an emergent topic. Equally, our analysis of counterparties takes into consideration their ESG strategies and performance.</p>
<p>Finally, the way we work matters too. Tideway’s finance department has been developing sustainable and healthy initiatives for a few years now: paperless meetings, monthly reports on printing, month-long plastic challenge to encourage people to reduce the amount of single-use plastic used, volunteering litter-picking events to clean the river foreshore. As a team we have created a culture where the lack of recycling, use of plastic and unnecessary printing is frowned upon and we have recently won a Clean and Green Treasury4Good award for these efforts.</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>Sustainability should be a personal and corporate imperative for all. It will take the collective actions of each of us, individually and corporately, to address the sustainability issues our societies face. This is for our own direct benefit now, and for future generations. It is simply the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Sustainability incorporates climate change, the Paris Accord 2oC target, CO2 emission levels, but is also more holistic in terms of UN Sustainable Development Goals, and it encompasses actions such as the preservation of natural resources, reduction in pollutants, and social responsibility.</p>
<p>From a direct treasury perspective, there are lenders who want to put money to work for positive impact. This can also provide some flexibility in terms of relative return expectations from banks and institutional investors. There are governments, regulators and institutions who are looking to encourage society and the corporate world to invest sustainably. Directing capital for positive impact via debt financing is a potential route to encourage this.</p>
<p>LMA and ICMA-compliant green loans and green bonds have benefits to borrowers in terms of the pricing and volume available relatively. They are relatively approachable as the mechanisms by which the activities can be characterised as green are highly customised to the circumstances of the individual organisation. The green aspects are expertly reviewed and externally accredited. In addition, the banks have also started extending sustainability linked loans, incentivising further improvements in ESG impact, via ESG scores or KPIs, to support lower loan margins.</p>
<p>Beyond these potential immediate economic benefits to treasury budgets, there is also the opportunity to mitigate business risk and, therefore, credit risk/credit rating risk. This is achieved by having a strategy that minimises the idiosyncratic risks associated with a breach in ESG standards. Better still, some companies can gain competitive advantage by positioning themselves to benefit from the opportunities that come from the transition to a sustainable economy.</p>
<p>More broadly, equity investors are also seeking positive impact and investments with mitigated risks against sustainability, for example, via the UN Principles for Responsible Investing that many fund managers sign up to. Treasury can support this by drawing attention to the positive purpose of the company. So the benefits of a sustainability focused strategy extend beyond the treasury area to the board and corporate strategy.</p>
<p>There are also risks in the pursuit of a sustainability-focused treasury strategy, in terms of the complexity around its implementation and management. Implementation can be complicated, time consuming and has some additional costs. It will also probably necessitate support and input beyond finance, from the teams responsible for Corporate Social Responsibility and ESG. Once you do implement a sustainability focused treasury strategy, there are also further risks and issues to manage. These might include the reputation risk if commitments are not met, the additional reporting obligations, additional ratings and more complexity.</p></div>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>Sustainable finance has taken a firm hold worldwide. As climate risk intensifies, and sustainability concerns rise to the fore, issuers and investors are increasingly integrating ESG factors into business and investment strategies.</p>
<p>Less clear, to date, is the extent to which treasurers should be prioritising sustainable finance in their corporate strategies. The value to treasurers becomes more apparent, however, when we consider the many elements inherent to sustainable finance – such as its forward-looking perspective, enhanced disclosure practices, and consideration of a possible reduction in the cost of capital.</p>
<p>Moreover, awareness around the material impacts that ESG risks (and opportunities) can have on an entity’s finances is only rising. All this means that sustainability matters could well fall within the treasurer’s remit in the near future.</p>
<p>By nature, to ensure that the intended sustainability objectives are being met, sustainable finance requires disclosure of investment factors that transcend direct capital returns. This more holistic level of disclosure is of obvious benefit for treasurers – allowing for greater oversight over finances. Indeed, it is already-established practice in green financings to ringfence funds to ensure that proceeds are only directed to projects that offer an environmental benefit.</p>
<p>Looking at risks through a sustainable lens also provides a more forward-looking perspective when compared to a traditional view, incorporating emerging and strategic risks that could materialise in the longer term. This affords treasurers enhanced visibility in their financial planning activities.</p>
<p>What’s more, when we talk about risk in sustainable finance – and particularly in an ESG context – we look at the broad swathe of parties affected by success (or failure) of an entity’s operations. This extends far beyond shareholders and lenders to incorporate an entity’s suppliers and consumers, too – allowing treasurers a view of the ESG risks that are visible and material along the supply chain.</p>
<p>Finally, for those contemplating issuing green or sustainable bonds or loans, there is growing evidence that such instruments can provide a cost of debt advantage given the current imbalance between supply and demand for green financial instruments. Some recently-issued green-labelled bonds with external reviews have achieved up to three basis points advantage over non-green equivalents.</p>
<p>Although research is still in its early stages, some published data does link a strong ESG record with improved corporate financial performance and returns on investment. It suggests that those entities focusing on ESG issues have achieved reduced costs, improved worker productivity, mitigated risk potential and even revenue-generating opportunities.</p>
<p>Greater cognizance of such considerations is shifting sustainable finance into the mainstream. In fact, the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance estimates that US$30trn worth of assets were invested in line with ESG-related strategies in 2018.</p>
<p>And we are already witnessing instances of banks realigning their investment strategies to achieve sustainability objectives. Some are even changing their mandates to restrict lending to entities with perceived weak sustainable credentials.</p>
<p>Clearly, lending institutions and corporates are embedding sustainability deeper into their long-term financial strategies. In turn, treasury departments will have an increasingly crucial role to play – to both aid this transition and help tap into the estimated (by the Business &amp; Sustainable Development Commission) US$12trn of new market opportunities for sustainable businesses.</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p><em>The green bond market is flourishing, but there is plenty of room for further growth. In this article, we look at the development of the market and explore why corporates should consider issuing green bonds.</em></p>
<p>In his outgoing address, former US President Barack Obama said: “We’ve led the world to an agreement [the Paris Accords] that has the promise to save this planet. But without bolder action, our children won’t have time to debate the existence of climate change. They’ll be busy dealing with its effects. More environmental disasters, more economic disruptions, waves of climate refugees seeking sanctuary.”</p>
<p>Climate change is arguably one of the great issues of our time. And to prevent further environmental damage, significant investment is needed in environmentally friendly projects. Governments around the world have reacted to this need and have committed substantial amounts to green projects. However, this is significantly less than the US$10.5trn of green investment that the International Energy Authority estimate is required in the coming two decades to halt climate change.</p>
<h3 id=""shades-of-green"">Shades of green</h3>
<p>Channelling the tens of trillions of dollars that exist in the capital market towards climate change solutions is an effective way to achieve this. And core to this is the green bond, a financing product that can be loosely defined as any bond where the proceeds are specifically earmarked for green or environmental purposes.</p>
<p>In an effort to tighten the definition of a green bond, the International Capital Markets Association (ICMA) has created a set of Green Bond Principles (GBPs) – a voluntary framework that looks to add some structure to the green bond market. According to Nicholas Pfaff, Secretary of the GBPs at ICMA, companies that issue green bonds can publicise to investors that they are green by posting them on ICMA’s website and adhering to four key principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The use of proceeds must be put towards projects that provide environmental benefit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There must be a clear process to determine how the project fits within the eligible Green Projects categories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proceeds must be segmented and tracked so investors can ensure their money has been used towards green projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A framework must be put in place to show how the company will evaluate and report the impact of the project on the environment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are some nuances that need to be addressed because not every bond that is green is labelled a green bond. Indeed, statistics from the Climate Bonds Initiative highlight that only 17% of their broader definition of ‘climate aligned bonds’ are labelled green bonds. Sean Kidney, CEO of the Climate Bonds Initiative, explains that a bond issued by a solar wind farm company should be considered green even if it does not register with the GBPs, for instance.</p>
<p>“Ideally companies would abide by the GBPs,” he says. “Investors have expressed that this helps when they are reporting back to their clients and we believe that labelling is key to the overall growth of the market. However, it is important not to get caught up too much in the semantics as this can often detract from what we are all trying to achieve here.”</p>

<p>On the flip side, there is a lot of debate about whether labelled green bonds from traditionally non-green issuers should be considered truly green. In recent months, this debate has been reignited by the green bond issuance by Spanish oil giant Repsol and the first ever sovereign green bond issued by Poland. The Financial Times reported that some investors passed on investing in these bonds because one was from an oil company and the other from a country that was also raising finance for new coal plants as well as green projects.</p>
<p>ICMA’s Pfaff believes that investors criticising such issues on that basis are missing the point slightly. “The green bond market is meant to promote the transition of business models towards being greener and sustainable,” he says. “You can therefore have non-green businesses issue bonds focused on green projects and these bonds will still be classified as green under the GBPs.”</p>
<h3 id=""exceptional-growth"">Exceptional growth</h3>
<p>Definitional issues aside, the green bond market has grown markedly since the first issuances by the European Investment Bank and World Bank in 2007. However, in those early years, progress was slow and dominated by multilateral agency issuers. It wasn’t really until the GBPs were first published in 2014 that the market began to take off and corporates began to enter the market, with issuance rising to just over US$11bn that year, up from US$3.1bn in 2013.</p>
<p>Recent growth has been more dramatic. Indeed, 2016 saw US$93bn of green bonds issued, including domestic Chinese green bonds, a record year and a greater than 100% increase compared to 2015. “All eyes have been on the green bond market in the past 12 to 18 months,” explains Beijia Ma, Equity Strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofAML). “The market has really begun to take off and this is being driven by China, which is now the world’s biggest green bond market.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><p>Ma is keen to note that while all eyes are on China, other emerging market countries are also developing green bond markets. “Europe is the most developed market,” she says. “But we can’t overlook the progress being made by the ASEAN countries, India and Brazil where the governments are taking active steps to develop and promote the market.”</p>
<p>Geraint Thomas, Executive Director at MUFG, is also buoyed by the evolution of the green bond structures being used by corporates. “In the last few quarters we have seen the first hybrid structure issued by TenneT. Toyota in the US also completed an asset-backed security deal a few years back,” he says. “These are important developments and I believe in the coming years we will see securitisation grow, with all the other bond structures that we are used to turning green as well.”</p>
<p>Growth in the market is also being driven by investors hungry for green paper. “We have seen significant growth in the amount of money that investors are dedicating to green and ESG investments,” says Thomas. “This has been the other significant driver behind the market and demand is still outstripping supply.”</p>
<h3 id=""what-is-in-it-for-corporates"">What is in it for corporates?</h3>
<p>Attracting new investors is precisely the reason why many corporates have issued green bonds. As the Climate Bonds Initiative’s Kidney explains: “The number one reason that corporates issue green bonds is to diversify their investor base. They have realised that there is a huge pool of people (and money) that like to invest in green products, many of whom they might not have dealt with before.” Kidney adds that corporate treasurers have told him that if they are able to get 15-30% of new investors to register for the bond then that is a huge success and will lead to price depreciation in the future.</p>
<p>Kidney is also keen to add that issuing green bonds creates an investor ‘stickiness’ for corporations. “Investors are calling for corporates to do more green bonds and they are genuinely enthusiastic about buying green paper,” he says. “This is a dream scenario for corporate treasurers issuing bonds.”</p>
<p>Off the back of this huge demand and diversified investor base, corporates are also beginning to realise price advantages by issuing green bonds, says Kidney. “Like any market, as it gets larger, prices begin to depress,” he explains. “Issuers are now realising a five to 15 basis point benefit in the dollar and euro green bond markets over traditional bond markets. This is great news and it will boost issuance next year.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere, BofAML’s Ma notes that there is a marketing benefit to be had from issuing green bonds. “Issuing a green bond can raise a corporate’s overall sustainability profile,” she says. “Apple, for instance, used its green bond last year to highlight all the work it is doing making sure its factories use renewable energy.” Meanwhile, ratings agencies like Moody’s and S&amp;P are actively exploring how CSR commitments might factor into a company’s overall credit rating.</p>
<h3 id=""straight-to-market"">Straight to market</h3>
<p>If these benefits are not enough, treasurers will be pleased to hear that the process of issuing a green bond is not too dissimilar to that of issuing a traditional bond, although there is some extra work required when making the first issuance.</p>
<p>“The bond structure and the terms and conditions will be very similar to a non-green version of the bond,” says MUFG’s Thomas. “The lead-up to issuance, however, is slightly different, beginning with the internal process for identifying the use of proceeds and ensuring this fits into the investors understanding of what is green.” Thomas notes that the issuing team will then need to work to make sure the bond aligns with the GBPs if it is to be labelled. “They may wish to get a second or third opinion on this to further verify the bond. This can, of course, add incremental cost to the first issue,” he adds.</p>
<p>To encourage corporates to issue green bonds, some countries are looking to remove this incremental cost. For instance, the Monetary Authority of Singapore announced earlier this year that it is launching a Green Bond Grant scheme which will cover the costs of external reviews for green bond issuance.</p>
<p>Adam Stam, Director, Secured Funding at Toyota Financial Services, worked on the company’s debut green bond issuance. He notes that while the credit risk associated with green bonds is no different from a traditional bond, there is an extra degree of reputational risk that needs to be managed. In Toyota’s case, it was necessary to ensure that the company could rapidly deploy the funds into investment in green vehicles. “It is important that any company looking to issue a green bond is aware of the reputational risk,” says Stam. “They shouldn’t just jump on the bandwagon, because in doing so they run the risk of damaging their reputation by not being able to deliver on their promises of investing in projects which are considered green.”</p></div>
</div>
<div class=""v-spacing--bottom highlight-block"">
<div class=""copy__body""><h3 id=""chinas-flourishing-market"">China’s flourishing market</h3>
<p>To find the world’s largest green bond market you need to look towards the world’s biggest polluter, China. Almost overnight, the country went from being a minor player in the market to accounting for 40% of the total value of green bonds issued globally last year. So what has been behind this rapid rise?</p>
<p>China is facing some serious environmental issues. The People’s Bank of China has estimated that the country needs US$320bn a year to meet government targets for addressing widespread air, soil and water pollution. Encouraging the financing of a green economy is therefore just one part of a wider plan from the Chinese government to halt or reverse the environmental issues that the country currently faces.</p>
<p>But as Herry Cho, Director, Head of Sustainable Finance Asia at ING, explains, ‘greening’ the Chinese financial system is crucial if the government is to achieve its objectives. Indeed, China’s 13th Five-Year Economic Plan states the importance of a “green, open and shared” development and incorporates a strategy for establishing a green financial system into the National Ecological Civilisation Construction Plan.</p>
<p>On the world stage China has also become a leader in the field. “As the G20 Chair, China has really put sustainability right at the forefront of the agenda and is encouraging the rest of the world to follow in its footsteps,” says Cho.</p>
<h3 id=""nuanced-green"">Nuanced ‘green’</h3>
<p>It must be noted that while China is taking great strides in the green bond space, it is slightly unique in terms of what it qualifies as green. “Despite largely being based around the GBPs, China does have slightly more broader standards around what qualifies as green,” says Cho. “This is perhaps most evident around the fact that China permits green bond proceeds to be put towards so-called clean coal projects.”</p>
<p>Another nuance is that in other countries all proceeds from a green bond go towards green projects. In China, however, corporate borrowers may use up to half of the proceeds of the bonds for working capital and paying down loans.</p>
<p>To offer some statistics, the latest numbers from the Climate Bonds Initiative show that 61% of the US$2.47bn in green bonds issued by China in the first quarter of this year failed to meet the international definition of such instruments.</p>
<p>With the country slowly liberalising its bond market and looking to attract outside investment, more transparency and a greater adherence to international standards may be needed before international green investors feel fully comfortable investing in Chinese green bonds.</p>
<p>That being said, the future looks bright for China’s green bond market and Bloomberg Business estimates that by the turn of the decade China’s green bond market could be worth US$230bn.</p></div>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><h3 id=""green-shoots"">Green shoots</h3>
<p>The green bond market, at the time of writing, is on course for another impressive year. However, despite the recent growth these bonds still only make up about 1% of the total value of the world’s capital markets. There is clearly a lot of room for the market to grow, and some would argue that this growth is vital to the future of the planet. What then is needed to help the green bond grow stronger?</p>
<p>For BofAML’s Ma, more government support is key. “The long-term trajectory of the market is good, but in the short term government support will be vital,” she says. “Governments offering favourable rates or subsidies to green bond issuers, like we have seen in Singapore, is just one way that this can be done. This will attract more and more companies to issue and see the benefits that this can offer.”</p>
<p>The need for governments to offer incentives is also cited by ICMA’s Pfaff. “We see significant growth in the market again this year and that is encouraging,” he says. “But for the market to expand at the rate we need it to, and for it to reach new markets, governments should also consider intelligent incentives to encourage especially corporates to issue green bonds.”</p>
<p>For ING’s Cho, the need isn’t just around more issuers coming to market; it is about ensuring that there are enough bankable green projects, especially in the emerging markets. “It is crystal clear that the amount of funding that is required for sustainable development is huge,” she says. “But the key issue that needs to be solved in Asia and other emerging markets is making sure that there is a pipeline of bankable projects available to finance.”</p>
<p>MUFG’s Thomas agrees and would like to see smaller companies embracing the green bond market. “The biggest constraint to its further development is size,” says Thomas. “Most investors are looking for bonds that meet the benchmark liquidity size. Most medium and small enterprises probably do not have green projects that fall into that category so they will struggle when issuing. It is here that securitisation can be an effective tool to grow the market.”</p>
<p>The Climate Bond Initiative’s Kidney believes that it is vital that the whole financial system comes together to make this market grow. “The market is far too small at present and not flourishing enough in my opinion,” he says. “If we are to shift our economies at the speed and scale needed to stop the planet becoming uninhabitable in the second half of this century then we need to give it everything we have. This is about survival.”</p></div>

<div class=""copy__body""><p><em>Sustainability is an evolving issue and one that can’t be ignored. Treasuries have a role in helping to fulfil the company’s corporate social responsibility – but it isn’t always clear how they can help. Here, we take a look at some of the options available to embrace ‘greener’ business, without impacting profits.</em></p>
<p>The impact of sustainability issues on treasury may not be immediately obvious. But when you consider the following examples, it becomes clear that it is in every department’s best interest to engage in the company’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) programme:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An increasing number of consumers look to make informed choices about companies on the methods used to source materials and manufacture, as well as the company’s own sustainability performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>International banks are, in some instances, encouraging clients to maintain stricter standards of environment protection to ensure they receive finance (for example, producers of palm oil).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carbon-intensive sectors may face an increase in the cost of capital and environmentally damaging practices in general are coming under fire from the regulators and public alike.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The risks that natural disasters, ones which occur as a result of the world’s rising temperature, pose to the continued operation of business are on the rise.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Indeed, looking after CSR concerns is part of an effective risk management strategy. But sometimes organisations have difficultly navigating the vast, and potentially daunting, range of sustainability initiatives, investments and agendas that companies can be engaged in. Against this backdrop, Treasury Today explores some of the key developments in the industry and the areas where treasury can look to ‘do its bit’: circular supply chains and paperless treasury.</p>
<h3 id=""circular-economy"">Circular economy</h3>
<p>Currently, in a predominantly linear economy, the world’s manufacturers extract raw materials, using fossil fuels to ship and process these in order to make products that are disposed of in landfills after use. One way of tackling such excessive waste is to change the structure of business models, so that products maintain their quality and usefulness for a much longer duration.</p>
<p>Advocates of a circular economy propose that products should be designed to be disassembled and regenerated; where the goods of today become the resources of tomorrow. But it’s more than just a CSR ‘plug-in’: the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, SUN and McKinsey have identified that by adopting circular economy principles, Europe can create a net economic benefit in 2030 of €1.8trn compared to today, double that offered by the current linear development path.</p>
<p>“Remanufacturing, for instance, could imply savings in terms of production costs that range from 30% to 90% of the cost of producing a new product from virgin materials,” says Dr Donato Masi, Assistant Professor, Supply Chain Management, University of Warwick.</p>
<h3 id=""from-supply-chains-to-supply-circles"">From supply chains to supply circles</h3>
<p>This, of course, would be a huge change for the supply chains of today. “For companies to capitalise on this opportunity, business models as well as collaboration across the supply chain need to be reconsidered,” says Jocelyn Blériot, Executive Officer, Ellen MacArthur Foundation. He provides the example of La Place – 100 of the company’s restaurants in the Netherlands provide waste coffee grounds to GRO-Holland, a company that uses them as a growth substrate for oyster mushrooms. The mushrooms are then sold back to the same restaurants to be used as ingredients. The supply chain is therefore made symbiotic or ‘circular’ by turning one player’s by-products into feedstock for the other.</p>
<p>As a result of such business models, there are, Blériot says, some effects on companies’ working capital and financing needs. “In the symbiotic ‘circular supply chain’ model there is a potential reduction in non-payment risk. Players become both buyers and suppliers and so possess a more equal balance of economic power, likely formalised by contracts that incentivise the continuation of the relationship.”</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class=""v-spacing--bottom highlight-block"">
<div class=""copy__body"">
<h3 id=""sharing-economy"">Sharing economy</h3>
<p>Another disruptive business model comes in the form of asset sharing. Your meeting rooms, printing facilities, and production staff – can you imagine sharing them?</p>
<p>When businesses have overcapacity of equipment, knowledge and skilled personnel, it can be seen as wasted revenue. For example, FLOOW2 was founded based on the idea that companies can rent out any equipment or personnel not being deployed at capacity. For those companies that rent, the benefits are the convenience offered without having to invest substantially themselves. It represents a change in mind-set from ownership to access and the founders see a sharing economy being an integral part of the future.</p>
<p>Slock.it offers a similar business proposition based on blockchain technology, claiming it can provide the future infrastructure of the sharing economy.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<div class=""copy__body""><h3 id=""pay-per-use"">Pay-per-use</h3>
<p>Another example of a circular business model is pay-per-use. Blériot uses the example of Philips, a company that in addition to selling lightbulbs now signs contracts to provide light by the lux (a measure of light produced). “The company keeps ownership of the lighting system, taking care of maintenance and remanufacture during the contract. When compared to traditional sales models, this can be more profitable for the manufacturer and cheaper for the user.”</p>
<p>Such innovative business models, which are based on services rather than product ownership, and innovative consumption patterns are gaining an increasing importance, says Masi. “Current trends suggest there will be rising prices and an increasing competition for raw materials.” Therefore, he believes, the circular economy represents an answer to these challenges and an opportunity to find synergies between the protection of the environment and the growth of profit.</p>
<p>But if corporates want to truly exploit the potential of the circular economy, Masi says, the principles of the circular economy need to be embedded at the strategic level of business model innovation. This cannot be done “by simply trying to make a production process green, or a closed loop supply chain more efficient. These principles should be embedded at the very early stages of product design, supply chain design, and definition of the commercial strategy.”</p>
<h3 id=""paperless-treasury"">Paperless treasury</h3>
<p>Whilst embracing sustainability in treasury may seem like a major overhaul, it is important not to miss opportunities that already exist in current projects. Improving CSR may not require the extensive effort that some may assume. Although originally submitted for other categories (including Best Working Capital Management), Amway India’s implementation of a virtual card accounts (VCA) solution – the first of its kind in India – was recognised by the Adam Smith Awards Asia 2015 as the winner for Best Corporate and Social Responsibility Initiative.</p>
<p>Amway India offers Indian citizens an unparalleled opportunity to own and operate their own business selling more than 140 high quality consumer products. Despite its exponential growth in India, the company’s payments and reconciliation processes have remained largely manual, which consumed considerable manpower.</p>
<p>Therefore, the treasury set out to tackle invoice processing costs and inefficiencies, increase the interest earned on cash surplus and extend the days payables outstanding (DPO) without additional cost. But the results in changing the paper-intensive workflow highlights that projects run by treasury can often have additional advantages.</p>
<p>The solution was a paperless supplier finance programme from Citi with no requirement for specific transaction documents or frequent invoice audits. Unlike traditional supplier finance programmes, the VCA scheme requires no documentation-intensive on-boarding process. Suppliers can use their existing credit card processing terminals to process the VCA payments and no additional equipment is needed.</p></div>

<p>Combining robust payment security, enhanced data through the setup of internal controls and approval workflows, the solution has improved compliance, efficiency and visibility of Amway India’s sourcing and purchasing processes.

<p>Make the most of your bank’s online offering. Logging into your bank’s online platform to view bank accounts will surely be much quicker than digging out the relevant file. It also provides added security controls and keeps an easily accessible record of reviewing and approval processes.</p>
<p>Embrace e-invoicing. In addition to the cost benefits that have been so widely reported, e-invoicing leads to greater consistency and standardisation, which in turn helps to reduce organisational complexity.</p>
<p>Say goodbye to cheques. Using electronic payments instruments improves visibility, reduces the risk of fraud and can significantly reduce costs. Consider wire payments, cards programmes and mobile solutions. Where customers persist in paying you by cheque, discount incentives for signing up to direct debit may be useful.</p>
<p>Consider electronic bank account management (eBAM). Do away with paper-intensive account opening and maintenance procedures to really improve efficiency and control.</p>
<p>Set up digital treasury workspaces. Whether in a secure cloud environment, or protected on your work server, archive reports and other documentation electronically. The search functionalities this provides can prove invaluable.</p>
<p>Printer etiquette. If you or your team really do have to print, make sure it’s double-sided and on recycled paper. Any non-confidential documents should be put in a recycling bin after use and a sustainable confidential document destruction programme implemented.</p>

<div class=""copy__body""><p>In the 1700s, pharmacy group Alliance Boots took its social commitments seriously by providing cheap medicines for poor people. In 2013, the same social and ethical values are part of the company’s DNA. “Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is so much easier if the values are incorporated into what people do,” explains Richard Ellis, Director of CSR at Alliance Boots. “So whether you are a treasurer or a beautician working for Alliance Boots, we say incorporate these values into the way you do your job.”</p>
<p>That may be easy for Ellis to say. After all, CSR is his sole remit and he works for a company with a strong ethical brand. But how and where does a corporate treasurer fit into all of this, if at all? Does environmental, social and governance (ESG) have any applicability to what they do? Even if they work for a company where ESG and CSR are core to its brand, how can a treasurer, who is typically focused on cash preservation and liquidity, incorporate sustainability and ethical considerations into their investment decisions?</p>
<p>Sustainable and ethical investments typically entail applying negative or positive screens to evaluate particular factors (tobacco, alcohol, weapons, etc), direct investments in renewables or carbon credits, investing in funds which contain issuers that are screened against ESG benchmarks, or ethical investments such as Islamic finance.</p>
<p>A number of EU corporate pension funds already integrate ESG into investment decisions, according to the European Sustainable Investment Forum (Eurosif). Eurosif’s 2011 Corporate Pension Funds and Sustainable Investment Study found that 56% of surveyed corporate pension funds had a Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) policy in place, 60% consider that ESG factors affect a pension fund’s long-term performance and 66% indicated that having an SRI policy is part of their fiduciary duty.</p>
<p>Pension funds, however, are typically long-term investors and are willing to tie their capital up for longer periods. Corporate treasurers, on the other hand, tend to take a more short-term view.</p>
<h3 id=""a-short-term-investment-horizon"">A short-term investment horizon</h3>
<p>“Most corporates are in a net debt position so if they have got cash they tend to invest that in short-term bank deposits or money market funds (MMFs),” says Michael Wallis, Group Treasurer at Marks &amp; Spencer. “That is more about securing cash and maintaining principal, whilst still getting some sort of return.” Royston Da Costa, Group Assistant Treasurer, Treasury Systems and Development, Wolseley Group Services, states that Wolseley’s policy regarding investing surplus cash is quite specific. “We either deposit short term with our relationship banks or use a select number of MMFs, based on their relationship with our banking partners,” he explains.</p>
<p>In Europe, the uncertain economic outlook reinforces the need for treasurers to stay short when they are investing unless they are told otherwise, remarks Olivier Brissaud, former Managing Director of Volkswagen Group Services and Chairman of the Association des Trésoriers d’Entreprises en Belgique (ATEB). “In Europe at least, treasury is about making sure the company has – at any time – enough money to implement its business strategy. That by definition is a conservative investment profile,” remarks Brissaud. “If the treasurer goes outside the traditional constraints provided for treasury and invests in ethical or sustainable investments they might lose money.”</p>
<p>Finding out information about sustainable and ethical investments is also challenging for treasurers. “It is not that easy to find any ratings agencies that rate the ethical behaviour of companies,” says Brissaud. For that reason ethical investments should be done through a company’s CSR team, as they are responsible for (re)building a link between a company and society. François Masquelier, Chairman of the Association des Trésoriers d’Entreprise à Luxembourg (ATEL), says communication about potential ethical and sustainable investments is not great. “That can perhaps explain why ESG is not (yet) an issue for a vast majority of our members,” he says.</p>
<p>Masquelier says treasurers are more focused on counterparty risk and on how to get decent (and if possible, not negative) returns. “The recent financial crisis has focused energies and priorities on other issues,” he says. “Furthermore, even for longer-term investments, I am not convinced that CSR and ethics are top concerns. We should regret this but it is a fact. I’m convinced that things will evolve. Let’s remain optimistic and see – often treasurers are followers.”</p>
<h3 id=""shareholders-versus-sustainability"">Shareholders versus sustainability</h3>
<p>In the case of longer-term investments, Jeff Wallace, Managing Partner at Greenwich Treasury Advisors, says companies with huge hoards of cash may be more likely to apply sustainable and ethical investment criteria. However, long-term corporate excess cash is mostly related to interest rate securities and very little equity, which is where most sustainable and ethical investments are made. When it comes to bond investments, Wallace says treasurers are paid not to lose money. “In fact they could lose their job if a bond investment went bad,” he says.</p>
<p>Sometimes treasurers are involved in investment decisions made by the company pension scheme. Wallis of Marks &amp; Spencer sits on the investment committee of the company’s pension scheme. He is not directly involved in investment decisions but says the committee takes the ESG side of things very seriously. Marks &amp; Spencer’s pension scheme is a signatory to the UN’s Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Although treasurers concede they should perhaps look at other types of high yielding investments, including sustainable and ethical investments, Da Costa says they are still governed and guided by internal policies, which are set by the board, which in turn refers to its shareholders. While some shareholders are focused on short-term returns, others like private equity firms that invest for the longer term are insisting that companies pay closer attention to ESG. New York based private equity firm, KKR, which led a buy-out of Alliance Boots in 2007, believes ESG is essential when it comes to value protection (making sure a company it invests in doesn’t lose money due to any ESG issues), value management (ensuring a company achieves best value) and value creation (integrating ESG into product sustainability to ensure operations run better).</p>
<h3 id=""smarter-investment-decisions"">Smarter investment decisions</h3>
<p>Elizabeth Seeger, sustainability lead at KKR, says sustainable and ethical investment pays off in the short term, as well as the long term. In December 2012, KKR announced $365m in cost savings and revenue from its Green Portfolio Programme of companies by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, waste and use of water. “Environmental efficiency does have an impact on the financial performance of companies and on the bottom line in the short term,” says Seeger. However, she says most people tend to think of ESG as being separate. “Part of the problem is the terminology – ESG, CSR, etc,” she explains. “People fail to realise that just because you are thinking about cash flow doesn’t mean you are not thinking about ESG issues.”</p>
<p>This raises a number of important questions for treasurers. Treasurers manage cash flows, but what about the quality and sustainability of those flows? “We have a tendency to think about economic systems as though participants only need to worry about the micro issues which affect them, and everything else will fix itself,” observes David Pitt-Watson, a Senior Fund Manager and Treasurer at UK charity Oxfam. Although corporate treasurers may think their actions will have very little impact, Pitt-Watson says they should take a step back, look at what they are doing and how it fits with things happening in the rest of the world. What can they do to make sure they are supporting responsible investment? How can they modify their actions whether working on their own or with others?</p>
<p>But does ESG mean sacrificing capital preservation, liquidity and yield – aspects treasurers most care about when making investments? “In the minority of cases, you may have to sacrifice profitability,” says Pitt-Watson, “but once ESG is integrated into your system it becomes less costly and often profitable. If everyone focuses on sustainability issues, we will all be much better off.”</p>
<p>Keith Welks, Deputy State Treasurer for Pennsylvania, says many asset owners have become accustomed to entreaties for investments that are sustainable but are not good investments from a principal preservation and yield perspective. “As a result, some of them run for the hills if they get a whiff of ESG, even if the opportunity might otherwise still be appropriate for them. I believe you can make these kinds of investments work in many instances. You need to think about the structure that works for you as an investor with multiple objectives and look at opportunities with open eyes.”</p>
<p>Much like a corporate treasury, Pennsylvania State Treasury has a prudent investor obligation, which means it must invest in a manner that preserves principal, maximises liquidity and generates returns or yield. In 2005 a new State Treasurer was appointed in Pennsylvania, and Welks and other members of the treasury team were asked to consider a fourth factor when making investments – an added benefit to the state’s economy, a particular segment of the population or an appropriate public policy objective.</p>
<p>“That is when we started looking at the energy efficiency of residential homes that would cost owners less,” says Welks. Treasury set up an investment scheme for homeowners offering them low-rate loans (11,000 loans worth $80m) for energy efficiency measures. It recently aggregated a large number of the loans and sold them in the secondary market. The loan portfolio generated a yield of 5%. “It has outperformed fixed income investments,” says Welks, “generating appropriate and acceptable returns with limited risk, which gives us the opportunity to make funding available to 11,000 homes.”</p>
<p>Pennsylvania State Treasury also developed an investment fund where it provides 20% equity for making energy conservation improvements to old college buildings. By focusing on proven technologies and also providing a steady stream of income, Welks says the college fund addresses two of the most common objections to clean energy: it avoids technology risk and provides liquidity much earlier in the investment cycle.</p>
<p>Where it uses external investment managers, treasury also started asking them about their sustainability criteria – employment of women and ethnic minorities, environmental and sustainable practices both by the managers and the investments they review. “We’ve gotten pretty anodyne responses to our inquiries so far,” says Welks. “Right now we’re at the stage of deciding how we apply the information that we have. We still expect a good rate of return from our investments with these managers but we are also looking for double or triple line benefits. As prudent investors we try to figure out what are the attributes we should be looking for in order to make smarter investment decisions that make money for treasury.”</p>
<h3 id=""mmfs-with-a-conscience"">MMFs with a conscience</h3>
<p>Fund provider Amundi in France has made it easier for corporate treasurers to gain investment exposure to ESG without really having to do anything. It applies SRI criteria to its flagship MMF, Amundi Treso EONIA ISR, which has €25 billion in assets under management. Amundi’s SRI filter is applied to all issuers in the fund and its team of SRI analysts do all the groundwork in terms of assessing the SRI credentials of issuers.</p>
<p>“We are providing customers with additional analysis, which adds value,” says Patrick Simeon, Head of MMFs at Amundi, adding that most of the French corporate treasurers that invest in its SRI MMF have responded with interest. Assets under management in the Treso EONIA ISR fund have increased by 25% since 2011. In terms of the fund’s performance, in this asset class Simeon says the main issue is that the investment universe is over weighted towards banking and financial names with an average SRI ranking. “This doesn’t weigh much on the performance of the MMF,” he explains. “It is purely adding transparency. The key element of our approach is security and liquidity. Performance is the cherry on top of the cake.”</p>
<p>Dominique Blanc, Head of SRI Research at Novethic, a leading CSR and SRI research centre in France, says there are significant assets in SRI MMFs in France. According to its research, in 2012 the French SRI market saw growth of 39%, following a growth of 69% in 2011. Although corporate investors are not necessarily asking for SRI, Blanc says they are not saying no to it either. “The financial and risk characteristics of these funds are the same as traditional MMFs, but as a value add they have a sustainability aspect,” he explains. A breakdown of SRI assets by type of owner shows that in 2012 corporates made up 6%, the fifth largest group behind insurers, pension funds and public funds.</p>
<h3 id=""sustainable-bonds"">Sustainable bonds</h3>
<p>Another asset class that presents corporate treasurers with SRI opportunities are sustainability bonds. Last year, FMO, the Dutch development bank in the Netherlands, issued a $41.3m six-year sustainability bond for KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. Treasury and Risk Manager, Vijay Panday, made the investment on KLM‘s behalf. “KLM is pleased to participate in the sustainable bond issued by FMO,” he stated. “This combines our financial strategy to further reduce our US dollar currency risk and our strategy to be leading the industry regarding sustainability.” KLM is a signatory to the UN Global Impact initiative of 1999. It also occupies the sector leadership position in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.</p>
<p>“More and more investors are attaching a value to the non-financial aspects but it’s still not mainstream,” remarks Huib-Jan de Ruijter, Director of Financial Markets for FMO. The sustainability bond developed for KLM was the first issued by the development bank, which uses negative screens to exclude certain companies, and also applies environmental and social requirements such as the IFC Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability to all its financing activities. The cash flow of the bonds are not directly linked to the credit risk of a specific project and FMO has a AAA credit rating. “The bond matched the needs of KLM’s treasury and it can be tailored in terms of tenor and currency,” de Ruijter explains. He says treasurers should look at sustainability bonds in the same way as they look at other investments, but the extra bonus is the non-financial component. “I am not suggesting that they should get more on the non-financial side and give up something on the financial side. They don’t need to make that trade off.”</p></div>
