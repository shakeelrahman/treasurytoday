<div class="copy__body"><p>Cross-border payments can be constrained by unstructured, incomplete and inconsistent data. This low-quality data is subject to different interpretations and can require manual intervention and repairs before processing. To overcome this challenge, a modern data standard, ISO 20022, was created. As an open international data standard, it brings significant benefits in the form of increased automation, faster processing, and improved mitigation of financial crime risk – all critical components in the cross-border payments process.</p>
<p>Already used by payment systems in over 70 countries, ISO 20022 will be the de facto standard for high-value payment systems of all reserve currencies by 2025, supporting 80% of global volumes and 87% of the value of transactions worldwide. In addition, starting from November 2022, the SWIFT community will start adopting ISO 20022 for interbank cross-border payments and cash reporting, with a coexistence period with MT messages until November 2025.</p>
<p>While many corporates have been using ISO 20022 for a considerable period now, the upcoming transition will bring further benefits for not only corporates but everyone within the payments industry. This wider market adoption means that corporates will be able to embrace the benefits of true end-to-end integrity of a financial transaction by ensuring that data flows seamlessly without truncation or alteration as the transaction progresses through its lifecycle. Corporates will be able to make real-time, data-driven treasury decisions and focus on their core business and opportunities for innovation. Richer quality data also means that corporates will have access to deeper analytics for more accurate forecasting, which will support more sustainable business growth. Ultimately, it will drive the next generation of business innovation.</p>
<p>As many in the banking community (banks, financial institutions and their vendors) will move to full ISO 20022 capacity in the next three years, there’s a clear need for corporates to adhere to these new standards as well. Such a major transition within the payments industry will create a strong demand from banks to their corporates to be fully ISO 20022-compliant to ensure interoperability and data integrity all along the payments and reporting chains.</p>
<p>Global interoperability means harmonising ISO 20022 market practices worldwide. In preparation for this new phase of cross-border payments, corporates need to take the necessary steps along with their ERP, TMS and related system providers to upgrade to ISO 20022. To do so, these systems need to be configured to support rich and structured data. This will ensure that all data meets compliance and due diligence standards.</p>
<p>Corporates should also consider early adoption of ISO 20022 cash reporting and statements to receive higher quality data, ultimately facilitating auto-reconciliation. Supporting new data elements can also assist in achieving seamless data flow. This can include upgrading to the newer pain.001 V9 and consolidating payments and cash reporting using a forwarding agent.</p>
<p>With the expectation for corporates to deliver payments fast, efficiently and securely, ISO 20022 adoption is imperative for a fast and frictionless future for the payments industry.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><h4 id="why-iso-20022-could-be-a-game-changer">Why ISO 20022 could be a game changer</h4>
<p>Much of the complexity of treasury transformation derives from bank statement reporting, specifically:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Creating rules to successfully import bank balance and transaction reporting (banks typically have different file formats).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring that reconciliations and cash allocation can be automated despite information potentially being truncated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Different file formats per region or per frequency.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This often results in expensive consultants being required to build rules, extensive testing and issues if and when banks make changes to formats.</p>
<p>The best cash allocation software requires time-consuming implementation, but can use AI and attachments to compensate for truncated payment references to achieve well over 90% automated cash allocation. This works best with remittance advices as well as the payment.</p>
<p>This lack of standardisation equally makes interoperability between systems and companies very difficult. As an example, where remittance advices are used – who chooses the format? The beneficiary? If so, the remitter has to use lots of different templates. Or if it’s the remitter, then the beneficiary has to be prepared for multiple formats. We are equally seeing this with APIs: with each bank taking their own approach to APIs, it makes working with multiple banks challenging. For corporates, the ISO 20022 standard has been around for some time, allowing corporates to move to XML file formats and richer data – and this is next on our roadmap, so that we move to richer, more real-time data.</p>
<p>However, what is changing is that cross-border payments are migrating for banks to ISO 20022, meaning that it becomes mainstream and so ERP providers and treasury providers will start to provide capability by default.</p>
<p>This should make a transition from MT940/942 or BAI files to XML much more straightforward. For our part, in order to shift to XML we will need to ensure that our ERP and TMS are both set up for the new file format. As CAMT files can still vary in structure, we may need work to ensure that the systems can read files for each bank, which may vary. This allows access to the world of APIs and real-time treasury, allowing pay by bank solutions to rival card solutions for pace and data.</p>
<p>ISO 20022 files will also make sharing data via blockchain easier, with standard naming conventions meaning that the same fields can be mapped to each other in different systems. Again, the power of this is being seen in some of the early blockchain solutions, particularly in the supply chain finance space, where API calls can be used to trigger payment for goods and services.</p>
<p>The potential of richer data is enormous. Solutions such as virtual accounts exist to address challenges around reconciliation. With XML files with stronger references, they may not be necessary. However, success depends on whether common implementation approaches are adopted – standard bank file formats, other users making use of the richer reference fields, etc. My suspicion is that a shift to XML will yield benefits – but until adoption is widespread, and tools like blockchain make a common approach more or less mandatory, it may be some time before we see the full potential.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Treasury departments of large global corporates are often dealing with complex payments processes and environments, including multiple banks. Cash management and funding are often managed locally in the various countries, where multiple banking partners are involved. By using a combination of different bank communications channels like SWIFT, host-to-host communications in shared service centres or web-based banking systems in subsidiaries, it is difficult for corporates to integrate these channels effectively within their TMS and ERP systems.</p>
<p>With disparate systems and processes, treasurers lack the visibility and control across their payments. Their decision-making is impaired if they can’t see what payments are leaving the organisation. Without the proper automation and workflow in place, companies are at risk of errors and the increasing risk of fraud.</p>
<p>New technology, which connects corporates with their financial partners, particularly with banks, is evolving fast. Cloud-based solutions integrate services so that corporate treasurers can gain access to a wide range of additional services through one single access point. Increased standardisation for exchanging financial messages between counterparties will allow easier integration of systems and processes, thanks to ISO 20022.</p>
<p>Using the more structured and richer data that ISO 20022 provides allows not only better straight through payment processing, but also helps corporate treasurers further automate their reconciliation processes, and therefore increase payments speed and reduce costs. By implementing these ISO 20022 messages, more information can be provided to compliance departments when performing sanction screening or transaction monitoring, and may also enhance fraud prevention and detection. This will lead to a more seamless client experience as those payments are embedded in the processes that they support.</p>
<p>There are other possible implications of ISO 20022, however. One is cost. If you continue to send payments using MT formats, the bank will need to convert the messages to ISO 20022 – which is likely to result in higher fees. Another consideration is that banks are continuing to work on upgrading to newer versions of ISO 20022. As a result, organisations that don’t have a payment hub will have to upgrade their back-end systems and carry out development in their ERP systems, which is likely to be an expensive undertaking.</p>
<p>ISO 20022 is a game changer and signifies an opportunity for banks and corporates to improve operational efficiency and reassess existing business models. By taking out all the effort that today is spent on message translations, conversions, manual reconciliation etc, allows every actor in this payment chain to focus on value added activities, on data driven services, on better liquidity forecasts and better risk models.</p>
<p>The good news is that the migration is not mandated for corporates. Older messaging formats will still be supported. But companies that don’t migrate will not be able to harness the opportunities brought by richer data. Companies that already have a payment hub between their ERP/TMS systems and bank communication channels, that is fully compliant with ISO 20022, will be able to benefit from the changes. However, companies that don’t have a payment hub will need to start a dialogue with their banking partners and ERP/TMS providers. Preparation for ISO 20022 should start now, whether a large corporate is looking to adopt to ISO 20022 end-to-end, or a smaller company simply wants to provide the necessary party and remittance information to its banks.</p></div>

<p>China’s importance in the global trade arena is well known: it is both the world’s second largest economy, and the leading global manufacturer. In addition, as the primary trading partner for 128 out of 190 countries around the world, China is the largest trading nation.</p>
<p>As such, supply chain finance (SCF) – a solution that allows companies to offer their suppliers early payment of their invoices via a third-party funder – has much to offer companies operating in China. In a nutshell, SCF allows companies to free up working capital for themselves as well as for their suppliers. It also improves the predictability of payments for suppliers and reduces supply chain risks, thereby increasing the resilience of supply chains.</p>
<p>China is already embracing the benefits of this approach: the local SCF market is highly sophisticated and has attracted significant investment by a number of different parties. Haiyan Zhuang, the newly appointed Head of China at working capital solutions provider Taulia, notes that China’s SCF market has been estimated to be around RMB 10-15trn (US$1.5-2.3 trn) – and that the government has been proactively encouraging the support of SMEs in China, particularly through the use of SCF.</p>
<p>“For example, in 2019 the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) and People’s Bank of China (PBoC) published a specific policy to promote SCF in China,” he says. “And last year, eight government ministries issued an updated SCF policy to promote and enhance its development.”</p>
<h4 id="scf-in-china-challenges-and-opportunities">SCF in China: challenges and opportunities</h4>
<p>Nevertheless, regulatory considerations can also present challenges as well as opportunities for SCF providers. Financing and banking are highly regulated in China, as is technology and the use of data. “The regulatory regime is very different in China compared to Europe or North America, as are the customer personas, expectations of technology, and business models,” Zhuang comments.</p>
<p>Another notable feature of China’s SCF market is that for suppliers, the cost of funding can vary considerably. Different cities and provinces have varying levels of maturity, and risk levels can also vary depending on whether funding is sought pre- or post-shipment. As a result of the many variables, Zhuang says the cost of funding for suppliers could be as low as 3-4%, or as high as 10-15%. On the flipside, suppliers’ access to capital has improved in recent years for a number of reasons, including the rapid development of the local SCF market and the arrival of new players in the market.</p>
<p>Another important driver is the rise of new technologies. From harnessing big data for quick credit profiling and information on the likelihood of default to the use of natural language processing (NLP) to handle requests more efficiently, there are many ways that technology can streamline SCF. And while the market has developed considerably, there is still plenty of room for improvement: “We believe technology can continue to play an important role in increasing efficiency across the whole SCF process,” says Zhuang.</p>
<h4 id="harnessing-scf-in-china">Harnessing SCF in China</h4>
<p>So where does SCF have the most value to offer in China? Steve Scott, Head of Asia Pacific at Taulia, explains that the solution works best “where there are complex supply chains – and also longer supply chains, in terms of the cash conversion cycle.” He adds: “Technology creates so much efficiency in the delivery of SCF that we can penetrate a deep supply chain, from strategic spend focused on the very large suppliers, all the way down to the mid tail and long tail of suppliers.”</p>
<p>In particular, SCF tends to be focused on physical manufacturing industries such as electronics, machinery, equipment and consumer goods, explains Zhuang. “The typical SCF customer will have certain characteristics, such as high domestic or cross-border trading volumes or turnover,” he says. “They will also usually have a high number of suppliers and distributors included in their supply chain, and multiple tiers of suppliers. The other factor is that payment terms across the supply chain tend to be quite substantial.”</p>
<h4 id="from-localisation-to-cross-border-capabilities">From localisation to cross-border capabilities</h4>
<p>For Taulia, given the dynamic and competitive nature of China’s SCF market, two themes are of particular interest – namely the importance of localisation and the need for cross-border capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Localisation</strong>. Given the differences between the market in China and other countries and regions around the world, Zhuang notes the importance of growing “in line with the local regulation, legal framework, banking operations and processes around areas such as electronic KYC and connecting to government agencies for automatic verification and registration of accounts receivable.”</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cross-border</strong>. Taulia is focusing on MNCs that operate in China, with local sourcing and overseas exports – and also on large local corporates that purchase significant volumes with other countries. “Our key objective for Chinese corporates is to present our solution and our global capabilities, and demonstrate how we can improve funding efficiency across multiple locations,” Zhuang says.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By focusing on these areas, the company aims to expand the reach and benefits of its solution to clients in China – such as enabling customers to transmit data efficiently through Taulia’s platform, allowing suppliers to view data easily, and supporting banks in processing funding requests rapidly.</p>
<h4 id="future-prospects">Future prospects</h4>
<p>Looking ahead, Zhuang says the government is currently targeting 6-7% GDP growth – modest compared to China’s growth in recent years, but nevertheless substantial – “so I believe the market will continue to expand.” In the meantime, he notes that China’s 14th five-year plan, the word ‘digital’ features many times.</p>
<p>“Building digital capabilities and a digital society is a national strategy,” Zhuang concludes. “So I believe the relatively high growth rate, and continued wave of digitalisation, will mean that market conditions continue to be favourable as we bring our unique value to the local market in China.”</p>

<p>The most important element of any digitisation strategy is a “crystal clear” view of what the organisation is trying to achieve. Speaking during a recent Treasury Today webinar on digitisation, liquidity and leverage in the post pandemic era, Andrew Blincoe, Head of Corporates &amp; Institutions at NatWest Group explained a second pillar to success comprises ensuring all stakeholders within the organisation are on board with the strategy.</p>
<p>A third is investment appetite: digitisation is a costly, multi-year commitment, he warned corporate treasury teams. “You need to avoid implementing obsolete processes; always think how the programme will be delivered too. Partnerships are prevalent and investing time in partners at the outset pays off many times over.”</p>
<p>A multi-year digitisation strategy at food group Kraft Heinz has been developed and structured along a timeline that takes into account the company’s strategic direction. It is also tailored to the external environment and direction of the wider industry, like changes in buying behaviour for goods since the pandemic, explained Yang Xu, Senior Vice President, Global Treasurer &amp; Corporate Development, Kraft Heinz.  She also highlighted the importance of identifying key disruptions and where the biggest impacts will fall. “Break down the project into critical milestones.”</p>
<p>Finally, Xu advised treasury teams to always look for a return on investment on activities, whether low hanging fruit or longer-term indicatives, and stressed the importance of a popular mandate. A board level mandate from the top cascades through the organisation, she said, listing the resources Kraft Heinz has put into its transformation, including a project management team, dedicated risk resources, and specialist talent.</p>
<h4 id="liquidity-lessons-from-the-pandemic">Liquidity lessons from the pandemic</h4>
<p>Xu said that the pandemic had shone a spotlight on liquidity. The key priority in the food industry at the time was safeguarding supply chains and production. The company already had careful plans for tightening liquidity and was able to draw on its playbook, including known pockets of liquidity, external funding and revolvers. She said that clear dialogue and preparation had ensured treasury and executives didn’t have to scramble “at the 11th hour.”</p>
<p>Blincoe added that the pandemic has also highlighted the importance of contingency planning and thinking ahead. It demonstrated the importance of having different pools of liquidity on hand, and of key bank relationships. It also demonstrated the value for treasury teams of being able to secure trusted advice at short notice, he said.</p>
<p>“Strategic banking relationships are one of the superpowers of treasury function,” agreed Xu.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, Blincoe said treasury teams would continue to draw support from supportive central bank policy and low interest rates. Corporates should also plan to return to their long-term target capital structure and take advantage of available sources of liquidity today to put themselves in the best position possible for the future.</p>
<p>Xu said prudence was her most important learning from the pandemic. For example, measures put in place ahead of the pandemic stood the company in good stead during the crisis, including a tender refinancing to reshape near term debt maturities, and holistic liability management beyond debt, such as proactively and consistently funding the pension scheme, which ensured the company didn’t have any unexpected large outflows of cash. Treasury was able to tap into the market when it was “friendly”, but if market conditions deteriorated, had options of liquidity to draw on, she said.</p>
<p>Blincoe concluded with an eye to the future, highlighting the opportunities that treasury teams will increasingly have to incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) into modelling and decision-making. The technology will allow teams to tailor responses and ideas, allowing real-time decisions based on AI projections. “The speed and opportunity is exciting, and one we can see coming,” he said.</p>
<p>Xu concluded with another word of advice on the importance of a prudent, proactive approach. She said liquidity was the “front line” and it was treasury’s duty to safeguard it.</p>
<p>“But ultimately, we are also only ever as good as our team,” she concluded the importance is to have a strong treasury team.</p>

<p>Technology is transforming corporate treasury, introducing a new level of speed and data quality to payments and cash management. In the first of a series of three podcasts, Standard Chartered’s Steve Pairman, Head of Cash Product, UK and Marion Reuter, Regional Head of Transaction Banking Sales Europe, explain how digitisation and technology is transforming the role of treasury via the provision of both real-time, and unprecedented rich and informative data.  A treasurer really needs to think how they are going to use this new data to both better manage treasury and help the wider business perform, explains Pairman.</p>
<p>In the past, treasury departments typically made their own, long-term strategic decisions. Today, real-time data allows treasury to get much closer to the business, adjusting strategy in response to instant payments or online collections. Elsewhere, it allows treasury to tweak funding levels in response to changes in financial markets highlighted during the COVID crisis, acting on a more ad-hoc and flexible basis that moves in line with the dynamic needs of the business. “Technology allows treasury to react to disruption much more quickly as things become less predictable and get closer to what is going on in the business,” says Reuter, explaining that this technological ability also encapsulates today’s 24/7, self-sufficient or future-proof treasury. “Treasury teams won’t be in the office 24/7. Your system has to have the right level of automation and be as self-sufficient as possible,” he says.</p>
<p>Today’s access to rich real time data brings the ability to process as you go, rather than wait for certain transactions, details Pairman. For example, real time data allows firms to update their liquidity positions in an interactive way, fund their positions in real-time rather than subject to restrictive cut off times, or ensure real-time reconciliation of receivables, ticking off transactions as they arrive through the day against working capital and transforming intra-day cash management.</p>
<h4 id="multi-banking">Multi-banking</h4>
<p>Real-time data is also changing multi-banking relationships. Digitisation allows instant intra day cash management across multi-banking systems, giving unparalleled real-time oversight, or as Pairman says, a “good grip” on all banking positions globally across payment types. “It’s not just cross border wires and the actual balances; more payment types are being used both on the sending side but also receiving side and this is an important source of real-time data,” he explains.</p>
<p>In another example, real time information allows automation around report generation, providing all the details for systems to generate a report for legal entities around automatic funding or repatriation, explains Reuter. However, she warns that real-time APIs also hold challenges for treasury teams with multiple banks – the API technology behind real time data is still bank, or system, specific. Clients need to have a uniformed and audited way to ensure that their systems are picking up the details from different bank and system providers, she says.</p>
<h4 id="supply-chain">Supply chain</h4>
<p>Technology is driving transformation in firms’ supply chains, allowing companies to remove the amount of paper in their supply chains and associated documentation. “Technology is improving supply chain visibility around goods delivery and invoices details, settlement expectations and real time information on the movement of cash and how goods are progressing throughout life cycle,” says Pairman.</p>
<p>However, he cautions that the quality and correct understanding of data is vital. “Bad data leads to poor decisions on working capital; understanding the data is key,” he says, linking this to the need by many corporates to beef up internal teams’ skills and resources to better manage data analysis. Incorrect data can disrupt the supply chain leading to incorrect planning around pay cycles or invoice management, and poor forecasting. “What does the data mean? Have we got the right data analysis to use it in the right way?” he asks. AI and blockchain technology are helping, however blockchain depends on all parties using it for the security benefits. Moreover, he said, single and shared databases are still the way forward for a lot of firms.</p>
<h4 id="no-one-size-fits-all">No one size fits all</h4>
<p>The need to link and combine multiple systems across a company has posed one of the biggest challenges to treasury digitisation. For some companies one large system provider is commonplace, but these solutions are often too costly for smaller companies which tend to have various systems in place, explains Reuter. “There are tools in the market in terms of consolidation around these systems,” she says, but counsels that there is no perfect solution, and progress is slow. Moreover, concerns about cloud-based solutions have also slowed the pace of digitisation. “Everything” is now in the cloud, but firms’ migration to cloud based systems over local data storage has been cautious. “Companies need to migrate to a new world in terms of systems. For a long time, there were concerns about cloud which didn’t help.”</p>
<h4 id="from-the-top">From the top</h4>
<p>Reuter also highlighted that the key impetus to corporate digital transformation must come from the top. “Treasury is not a department that can work in isolation,” she said. Corporate boards need to be across the role of digitisation in lifting a company and provide the human and financial resources to truly automate processes. “Digitisation is more than just payment flows and financial streams,” she said. “It is about how the company is digitising the products it sells and has a broad scope. Treasury alone can’t move the needle; it has to come from the top.”</p></div>

<div class="copy__body">
<p>The COVID-19 crisis has brought numerous challenges for companies around the world, from shoring up liquidity to transitioning entire workforces to remote working models. In addition, some sectors – including retailers that sell their goods via brick-and-mortar stores – have faced particular challenges, with social distancing measures and local lockdowns making it impossible to operate as they have done in the past.</p>
<p>Indeed, the developments of the last few months have resulted in significant changes to customer behaviour. While demand may have fallen for some types of goods and services, lockdown conditions also prompted a sudden increase in purchasing food, clothing and other goods online. “Some of our clients saw a huge increase in demand,” says Neil Pein, Head of Payments Transformation and Global Head of Acquiring at BNP Paribas, citing the rise in sales of sports equipment as people opted to exercise at home.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in March and April, the crisis led to a considerable decrease in transactions globally. But as Pein points out, this mainly related to in-store transactions – “what we saw online was that there was almost no decrease, despite the fact that activity dropped.”</p>
<p>In practice, many consumers “discovered the convenience of the online payment process” as they turned to online purchases and click-and-collect options offered by larger retailers. What’s more, this shift in consumer behaviour is likely to be here to stay, with consumers expected to continue shopping online going forward.</p>
<h4 id="supporting-clients-through-the-crisis">Supporting clients through the crisis</h4>
<p>For retailers, making the move from in-person transactions to online sales is not without its challenges. The shift has presented a considerable challenge for merchants who suddenly needed to cover this new channel, “because it was the only one that was viable and authorised at the time.”</p>
<p>However, necessity breeds invention – and BNP Paribas has taken action to support its clients in collecting payments remotely while their stores were closed. “We set up a secure solution called AXEPTA Lynk2Pay that enables merchants to collect all payments, either by email or by using an SMS,” explains Pein. “Consumers then don’t have to share their credit card details online or over the phone, which makes AXEPTA Lynk2Pay much more secure.”</p>
<p>The solution has been well received by clients, who have been able to stay close to their customers, with some creating a new sales channel that wasn’t previously available to them. Pein cites one client which had previously delayed a payments project, regarding it as ‘nice to have’. “With the current crisis, suddenly this became a big priority,” he says. “With this specific merchant, we onboarded all their stores in France and are now onboarding some outside France as well.”</p>
<p>Pein says this is a big advantage of the bank’s solution, which covers the whole of Europe and offers 300 different payment methods – “so it’s very convenient to extend this type of solution across customers’ geographies.”</p>
<h4 id="user-experience">User experience</h4>
<p>As Pein points out, it is likely that the shift towards ecommerce will last – not least because the trend spans all generations. But as well as requiring an online sales channel, retailers also need to be able to provide a smooth user experience, and to be able to follow customers as they moved through these new channels. The latter can be particularly challenging when customers make a purchase online but then go to the physical store to collect their items.</p>
<p>“We have built AXEPTA Unified Commerce, that enables managers to pilot their sales channels,” says Pein. “It analyses how many clients are coming from online and what they do then – do they go to the store? If they buy something from the store, do they want to go home and then return it, or exchange it for another colour online? Our solution allows merchants to optimise the customer experience and maximises sales.”</p>
<h4 id="future-of-brick-and-motor-stores">Future of brick-and-mortar stores</h4>
<p>In light of the events of recent months, what does the future look like for brick and mortar stores?</p>
<p>Pein says he believes these will continue to be part of the sales landscape. “The digital experience is increasing – we can do a lot of things – but in the end, people will still go to a store for the real, physical experience,” he comments, adding that people still want to be able to see real products.</p>
<p>“Maybe the experience that you will have in store will be different, meaning that you might not buy it as you used to,” he adds. “However, you will be still be very happy to enter a shop, see the products and compare them.”</p>
<p>That said, merchants are having to rethink the in-store experience in order to provide the reassurance consumers need in light of the continuing pandemic. Pein cites the rise of contactless transactions and the ability for customers to scan goods. “For example, we’ve increased the limit for contactless payments to €50. As soon as we did this, all merchants and all individuals knew they could use this and they used it a lot, because it was a response to social distance requirements.”</p>
<p>Another shift, Pein says, is that if consumers sample products and then have them delivered to their door, retailers may no longer need to keep large numbers of specific items in their shops. “You don’t need to have 50 samples of your sneakers in the shop to make sure you haven’t run out of products when your customers come in,” he says. According to Pein, this shift provides an opportunity for retailers to rethink their approach – for example by displaying a greater variety of products in store. This can result in a better customer experience.</p>
<p>Currently, Pein says, brick-and-mortar stores are the only channel offering an “emotional experience” for customers. While this could change in the future, with the rise of virtual reality and augmented reality, “these are still very young technologies, and it will take some time before they can catch up with real life experience.”</p>
<h4 id="small-stores">Small stores</h4>
<p>But what of the smaller stores that may lack the reach of larger retailers? How can these businesses maintain their relevance and be part of the industry’s wider journey to digitalisation?</p>
<p>In the new era of purchasing, Pein emphasises that there is still a place for small businesses – “I’m among the people who are very happy to still have my local bakery store” – but adds that lockdown has been a “tremendous shock” to such businesses. As a result, he says, “they need to reinvent themselves and probably provide additional services.”</p>
<p>As part of this transition, Pein notes that AXEPTA Lynk2Pay has enabled even small stores to provide a click-and-collect option for their customers. Also interesting, says Pein, is the rise of local marketplaces – such as a development in France that allows customers to shop online from a number of local shops using a single basket.</p>
<p>“When you think of marketplaces, you think of a very large company reaching merchants in Asia and the US,” says Pein. “But with the crisis, we’ve seen local marketplaces that are gathering local merchants in from the street.” He adds that this new way of addressing customers is beneficial for local shops, and provides a new way of creating client relationships and offering new services.</p>
<h4 id="Post-pandemic">Post-pandemic?</h4>
<p>Looking to the future, Pein says that the COVID-19 crisis has shone a light on the evolution of consumers’ purchasing habits, and the strategic role that both ecommerce and m-commerce can play in supporting those new habits. Indeed, he says m-commerce has proved to be particularly significant during lockdown, “because people were at home – they spent much more time on their mobiles.”</p>
<p>In addition, Pein says, the crisis has focused attention on the role of physical stores when it comes to providing an enjoyable customer experience. “That’s not a paradox – it’s just encouraged us to take the measure of what we already knew: that the retail future will have both channels, and will include the successful implementation of digital solutions into the customer experience and into stores,” he explains. “And what we have also discovered is that this is true for small shops, as well as for very large ones.”</p>
<p>Talking more broadly about the areas of innovation that will most shape people’s lives in the coming years, Pein picks out quantum computing as an innovation “which can tremendously change everything.” He explains: “I think it will force us to rethink all our security and everything we do with current computer science. And it could probably allow the real development of artificial intelligence, including many more uses cases than we can think of now.”</p>

<div class="copy__body">
<p>This tale begins much as it does with many global treasuries: de-centralisation, with too many banks and complex processes stifling optimisation. Conscious of the hazards of such a set-up, around 15 years ago, Roche’s treasury switched its focus to stronger risk management, and protection of the company, steering a course towards centralisation, leveraging the best solutions of the day and embracing the ongoing and rapid pace of development in both technology and regulation.</p>
<p>Having largely centralised by the time of the 2008 financial crisis, Roche’s treasury had already seen how its transformation could keep it on an even keel. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the imposition of home-working presented major operational challenges for many. But for Roche, having established “clear accountabilities” within its centralised structure, these have been largely overcome, says Stephan Bohner, the firm’s Head of Financing &amp; Markets.</p>
<p>Alongside empowerment to take action, under central control, he feels that having the clarity and transparency to know the group’s liquidity status intraday, and being able to execute funding and liquidity management through one platform, has been “extremely helpful”.</p>
<p>Of course, remote working, especially in treasury, can raise security concerns. With Roche’s centralised treasury system overseeing all processes, and with a bank-agnostic environment limiting the use of external technologies, Martin Schlageter, Roche’s Head of Treasury Operations, explains that Roche’s secure eco-system has long-since enabled secure remote-working. As the lockdown deepened, switching to home-working has been “completely seamless”. Such preparedness, he adds, has enabled treasury to immediately concentrate on the needs of the business.</p>
<p>With today’s set-up having been tested under pressure, the team is looking for further enhancements. There is scope for increased automation here, possibly applying it, for example, to the trading platform to facilitate deal execution. And as well as exploring custom reporting within Roche’s SAP core system, Schlageter has identified as a priority, access to as much daily liquidity management data as is available through that platform.</p>
<p>In this context, deployment of artificial intelligence and data analytics is being investigated, and treasury is keen to extract real-time information because, as Bohner explains, “for liquidity, yesterday’s data is no longer good enough”.</p>
<h4 id="strong-partners">Strong partners</h4>
<p>Roche has not travelled this path alone. One of its key partners is Citi. With liquidity paramount, Melanie Girouard, Treasury and Trade Solutions Sales Head for Corporates and Public Sector, Switzerland, says the bank continues to enhance its offering through the design and application of real-time solutions.</p>
<p>From delivering standard intra-day statements, to the automation of liquidity concentration and leveraging data and analytics, she says the aim is to help all clients make more informed decisions. “Straight-through processing is something on which we are very focused in the bank, so helping clients such as Roche achieve that is something we naturally strive for”.</p>
<p>Treasury centralisation and digitalisation is an ongoing project for Roche. Strong banking partners help standardise processes across the enterprise, says Bohner. With this support, he says treasury is bringing the complexity of its global operations under control and into one place.</p>
<p>As a service provider with a huge variety of processes to capture digitally (not least banking some 80 subsidiaries in-house) the team has its work cut out. In order to reap the benefits of a holistic system, Schlageter knows all stakeholder expectations must be met.</p>
<p>But for treasury to be wholly relevant as a service provider, it needs to leverage technology to help business colleagues better understand core treasury elements such as cash flow. In doing so, Schlageter says it helps unlock synergies, empowering business units to focus more effectively on their own specialisms.</p>
<p>Nowhere is treasury more relevant today than in the wider understanding of working capital. With some of Roche’s suppliers pressured in this respect, treasury stepped up its existing supply-chain finance programme. From day one, says Schlageter, “we have been able to support suppliers in accessing additional financing, adding value to the financial supply-chain of the company.” It is, he adds, true to the nature of its centralised set-up that Roche can scale up such solutions around the globe.</p>
<p id="video-interview">Girouard believes that programmes such as these will become a “gamechanger”, ensuring supply-chain resilience in challenging times. But few would have thought that at the start of its journey, the centralisation and digitalisation of Roche’s treasury would have such a far-reaching impact.</p>

<p><em>There’s no escaping the rise of APIs in the treasury space. As regulations such as the EU’s PSD2 began to roll in, banks around the world ramped up efforts to provide open banking technology for their corporate customers. In Asia, no such regulation exists – yet. But as banks and corporates alike recognise the benefits of APIs, we ask whether they’re delivering the promised benefits.</em></p>

<div class="copy__body">
<p>For the past few years, the use of application programming interfaces (APIs) in banking has gradually gained momentum in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region, with banks seeking to match the EU’s move to open banking. However, the diverse regulatory environments across APAC mean that progress has been staggered, with some countries advancing faster than others.</p>
<p>For example, in 2018 Japan implemented a “soft” open banking regulation. It was hoped that by the end of 2020 this would persuade the big Japanese banks to release APIs that open up access to accounts and enable third party delivery of payment instructions.</p>
<p>Singapore, meanwhile, has been spearheading the adoption of APIs. At the 2016 API Conference run by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Association of Banks in Singapore, Sopnendu Mohanty, Chief Fintech Officer, Monetary Authority of Singapore said: “If we want to realise our vision of becoming a smart financial centre, the key enablers of innovation – rapid experimentation, active collaboration, and a conducive ecosystem – must be present. The Monetary Authority of Singapore is of the view that the proliferation of APIs in the financial sector will facilitate Singapore’s transformation into a smart financial centre.”</p>
<h4 id="back-to-basics">Back to basics</h4>
<p>For Raof Latiff, Group Head of Digital and Product Management, Institutional Banking Group at DBS, one of the main challenges with APIs is ensuring everyone understands them. “Education is definitely number one. We spend a lot of time describing what they are, how they work, how they’re the new alternative to host-to-host environments, and the potential opportunities that they bring,” he explains.</p>
<p>A 2018 report from the Economist Intelligence Unit, ‘The Future is Now: How ready is treasury?’, found that 80% of the 300 senior corporate treasury executives polled believed they had “at least the majority of skills required to meet the challenges of treasury’s technological transition.” Yet the report notes that only 8% named APIs when asked to identify the top technologies they believed will bring the most benefit to their department.</p>
<p>For treasurers to be comfortable with implementing APIs, they first need to have a solid understanding of how APIs can benefit treasury. The Oxford English Dictionary defines an API as “a set of programming tools that enables a program to communicate with another program or an operating system, and that helps software developers create their own applications.” In other words, APIs enable different applications to communicate automatically with each other.</p>
<p>The website MuleSoft compares APIs to a waiter in a restaurant. The menu provides a list of dishes you can order. The waiter – or API – takes your order and delivers it to the kitchen. The kitchen is part of the ‘system’ which will prepare your order. The waiter will then deliver your food back to you. You don’t know how the food is prepared – nor do you really need to.</p>
<h4 id="promises-promises">Promises, promises</h4>
<p>For François-Dominique Doll, Executive Director, Global Treasury Advisory Services at Deloitte, APIs offer treasurers the possibility of direct integration between treasuries and banks. This, in turn, would lead to real-time treasuries, reductions in costs and better security.</p>
<p>According to Latiff, banks see APIs as a technology that can enable clients to achieve transformation – not just in treasury, but across the overall business. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this has been more integral than ever, with more companies looking to move online and therefore needing to develop a new business model. “When businesses move online and get more of their services integrated online, the only way to connect supply chains and their daily activity at a treasury level – which has good, meaningful visibility and transparency of transactions – is through APIs,” says Latiff.</p>
<p>Security is, of course, a key concern for many companies when it comes to introducing new technologies, and some may see APIs as an unknown entity. As such, companies may have concerns about the use of APIs by treasury departments which deal with sensitive data. But conversely, the ‘open’ nature of APIs means that they can be easily integrated with audit and analytics systems, which in turn help to identify and manage risk exposures.</p>
<p>Likewise, APIs are ushering in the wide-scale adoption of real-time treasuries and payments. The ability to connect instantly with a banking system means that treasurers are able to send and receive payments immediately, as well as have real-time visibility of funds.</p>
<p>And where cost is concerned, Doll notes that traditional host-to-host or SWIFT systems have their own costs – often because of the lengthy manual tasks associated with using them. In contrast, APIs are key to back office automation and so the cost comes only from the maintenance of the technology. In the current COVID-19 environment, as companies look to streamline costs, Doll points out that this is an important consideration.</p>
<h4 id="better-business-all-round">Better business all round</h4>
<p>A key benefit of APIs, explains Latiff, is that they offer companies the opportunity to transform their business platforms to have direct interaction with consumers. “APIs allow corporates to connect with marketplaces, ancillaries or wholesalers, and reach out to the end consumer,” he says. For a company to connect directly to the consumer, it needs to be able to input its inventory to an online platform, create a gateway to accept payments, have the ability to connect the logistics company and the warehouses – and finally, be able to deliver the goods to the final consumer. “How do you connect all of this on a real-time basis?” asks Latiff. “It’s through APIs.”</p>
<p>Doll agrees, and notes that many already in the direct consumer market, such as ride-hailing and food delivery companies like Uber and Grab, are already working well in the API space and driving the adoption and growth of the technology with their banking partners.</p>
<p>Latiff also says that newer companies are generally the quickest to adopt these new technologies. “For the modern-age names that are fully platform-based, APIs are the only way they connect,” he explains. “For them, it’s the norm. It’s how they operate in terms of connecting with the counterparties, their customers and their suppliers to enable a more digital experience.”</p>
<h4 id="ironing-out-the-kinks">Ironing out the kinks</h4>
<p>Like any new technology, there are still a few kinks to be ironed out with APIs. A key one, says Doll, is the lack of standardisation. “There’s no discussion between different banks about which formats should be used for APIs for payments, which means there’s no consensus on what the standardisation message is,” he explains.</p>
<p>For corporates with multiple banking partners, this could mean that implementing APIs is trickier than first thought. “Not all banks will be API-ready,” says Doll, adding that the question of readiness extends beyond banks. “Corporates should be asking themselves, ‘are our applications API-ready? Is our ERP capable of enabling the API with the banks? Is our TMS ready for this?’,” he says. Companies which are pioneering this technology may feel like something of a guinea pig – but by doing so, they will also be paving the way for other companies and reap the benefits of transformation first.</p>
<h4 id="there-are-some-alternatives-sort-of">There are some alternatives – sort of</h4>
<p>Strictly speaking, a company doesn’t have to adopt APIs if it doesn’t want to. Indeed, both Doll and Latiff point out that the existing systems do still function and are available. “For bank connectivity, the alternative is what is already in place,” says Doll – be this e-banking portals, host-to-host or SWIFT connections.</p>
<p>However, as Latiff points out, “These solutions are not straightforward, they’re not easy to integrate, and they cost a lot of money.” This is especially the case for companies that are not only looking to connect to banks but may be moving into the direct to consumer space. In this case, he argues, host-to-host connections are more costly and harder to scale – and making changes tends to be slow and inefficient. By comparison, APIs are a repetitive technology, meaning they are quick, easy and cheap to implement.</p>
<p>Where other options are concerned, Latiff believes these will depend on what problems need to be solved in the future. “There’s enough technology through APIs and Cloud services where we can enable various methodologies to drive solutions for new problems. As we discover them, I think we will discover what exactly an alternative could be,” he says.</p>
<h4 id="looking-to-the-future">Looking to the future</h4>
<p>With more companies adopting APIs, Latiff notes that education is a key focus. “What’s more important though, and what we’re trying to get into more going forward, is how these changes will shape the company and the treasurer,” he says. APIs are always improving and becoming more invisible. As a result, companies don’t actually need to understand the nuts and bolts of APIs – they just need a clear understanding of what they want to get out of them.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, APIs solve problems for treasurers. And with increasing regulations across various countries and regions pushing for open banking, they’re becoming a necessity. But, notes Doll, “It’s important for the treasurer to be vocal about APIs, and pave the way, driving the banks to adapt.” Since the banks are the ones that issue the APIs, he says it’s a necessity that they keep up with leaps in technology and listen to treasurers.</p>
<p>Latiff agrees, and says that from a banking perspective, it’s important to work with corporates to solve their problems. He has seen companies which previously used host-to-host technologies switching to APIs, and explains that whilst has benefits in terms of bank connectivity, companies don’t always take full advantage of what APIs can offer. “It’s easy to take the old pipes and replace them with new. What’s important with API solutions is to help companies transform and get new business opportunities whilst providing them with effective solutions,” he concludes.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>There can’t be many treasurers who are yet to notice the arrival of the application programming interface (API) in this space. There is good reason to be au fait with this technology phenomenon. As a means of allowing two or more software applications to interact seamlessly, APIs are not just convenient; they open up a whole new world of real-time-enabled possibilities to which every stakeholder in progress can apply their imagination.</p>
<h4 id="saving-time-and-money">Saving time and money</h4>
<p>In delivering real-time connectivity between bank and corporate, APIs offer the opportunity to capture data around transactions, almost as they happen. Data flow with unprecedented speed, transparency and seamlessness heralds the evolution of most day-to-day treasury activities. But APIs can also deliver transactional data, enriched above and beyond traditional SWIFT messaging content.</p>
<p>With more information, something as fundamental as reconciliations and payments exceptions management can be enhanced, saving time and money. Indeed, as the seamless and transparent banking experience is rolled out through APIs, it progressively removes treasury’s reliance on end-of-day batch processing and host-to-host connection with each bank, says Nadya Hijazi, Global Head of Digital, Global Liquidity and Cash Management and Business Banking, HSBC.</p>
<p>Without APIs, integration of the corporate TMS or ERP with a bank, supplier or other third party can require a heavy lift of technology, almost certainly demanding access to IT resources. Once that integration has been built, there is usually very little re-usability of those connections. For Hijazi, APIs offer a release from these chains, believing they give treasurers “an easier means of creating a much broader ecosystem”.</p>
<h4 id="leveraging-connections">Leveraging connections</h4>
<p>Published APIs can be consumed at will, enabling other services, even outside of treasury’s traditional sphere of reference, to be leveraged. Connecting services in this way delivers all kinds of capabilities that previously would have been costly and, in some cases, impossible. The idea that treasurers can re-use connections to create entirely new services is ground-breaking, says Hijazi. “When we talk to clients about different API use cases and opportunities, it’s a discussion always powered by how APIs can help them leverage new internal and external connections.”</p>
<p>The power of APIs is clearly demonstrated in the consumer space, where commercial apps are allowing users to easily find, order and pay for goods and services, providing order confirmations and delivery tracking, all in one place. Many of these apps are based on an underlying web of APIs, the app acting as the ‘one-stop’ aggregation of many different services, delivering a seamless service to the user. “In much the same way, we can help treasurers take advantage of this technology, reimagining their ecosystems, moving away from end-of-day processing towards real-time decisioning,” Hijazi explains.</p>
<h4 id="risk-management">Risk management</h4>
<p>The highly sensitive nature of treasury data could be seen as a roadblock. It’s true that APIs are data-driven and create links to certain underlying systems. Hijazi is candid in her assessment: the technology itself is no guarantee of risk reduction. “Security is only achieved by understanding what risks those technologies are subject to, and then putting appropriate controls around those technologies.”</p>
<p>The immediate nature of API connectivity demands monitoring and response capabilities to match. Of course, help in creating the right security infrastructure should be sought for any new technology, but as Hijazi also points out, since APIs are built on seamless ‘open’ technology, they can be easily integrated with audit and analytics systems – helping to identify and manage risk exposures.</p>
<h4 id="implementation-flexibility-and-scalability">Implementation, flexibility and scalability</h4>
<p>The integration of TMS or ERP platforms to banks’ host-to-host environments is complex and usually requires significant support for the treasury teams by the bank. APIs enable developers within the customers’ business greater self-service capability through the publication of technical API specification, automated exchange of tokens and the ability to begin the testing of the connectivity before engaging in the pre-production testing. This significantly reduces the implementation times and shifts the control to the corporate customers.</p>
<p>What’s more, the level of connectivity enables banks to expose more services and data to their corporate customers than a host-to-host channel which, is not easily consumable within a digital proposition. Of, course, treasury is unlikely to demand constant real-time information, and so the number of customer calls to banks’ infrastructure can be kept within “sensible realms” comments Hijazi. This, she says, makes API’s an entirely scalable proposition.</p>
<h4 id="setting-standards">Setting standards</h4>
<p>Currently, API development is not standardised amongst providers (not even PSD2 was prescriptive at this level). That said, HSBC worked with SWIFT, for example to define common API standards for its Direct Debit Fast payments API in Hong Kong which other providers will adopt. HSBC’s response to multiple standards has been to concentrate on the data within the API itself, standardising as much as possible around ISO 20022 XML v3.</p>
<h4 id="enhanced-viewpoint">Enhanced viewpoint</h4>
<p>APIs for transaction reporting can give treasurers enterprise-wide visibility across their accounts. Real-time data opens up the prospect of enriched reporting; with beneficiary bank processing status and SWIFT unique end-to-end transaction references (UETRs), treasury can achieve higher reconciliation rates, says Lance Kawaguchi, Managing Director, Global Head – Corporates, Global Liquidity and Cash Management, HSBC.</p>
<p>Indeed, at the highest level, because APIs can help treasury monitor and maintain cash and liquidity positions across multiple accounts and banks, Kawaguchi believes that it really can position the treasury to be able to make more informed and timely decisions on its cash.</p>
<p>Essentially, APIs mean that information becomes available when treasury requires it, he explains. By allowing real-time information to be integrated into treasury processes, through the TMS or ERP, he notes that instead of waiting for periodic data flows from the bank, treasurers can request real-time information such as statements, transaction statuses or balances. “Having real-time data enables further automation and the removal of risk-laden manual and paper-based process. But it also establishes the structure necessary for on-demand instant payment initiation.”</p>
<h4 id="added-value">Added-value</h4>
<p>What’s more, Kawaguchi feels that the prospect of real-time API-driven information raises the possibility of treasuries more easily deploying and benefiting from value-added services provided by banking partners.</p>
<p>As an example, when HSBC US Commercial Banking launched its Digital Partner Platform in early 2019, the aim was to deploy a series of APIs across an ecosystem that would make it easier for clients and third parties (such as fintechs) to access to HSBC’s products and services. One of the first offerings under this programme digitises commercial onboarding so that companies can directly apply for commercial banking accounts online. The aim is to begin rolling this out for cross-border account opening in select international markets.</p>
<p>With APIs allowing seamless integration between applications from different vendors, the notion of exchanging data directly – without the need for human interaction – is all part of creating a digital ecosystem that Kawaguchi says “will enable businesses to start building and delivering customer-centric propositions for their own customers”.</p>
<h4 id="enhancing-relationships">Enhancing relationships</h4>
<p>By providing real-time control over the treasury data flow, and payments and reconciliation processes, APIs will also enhance the overall banking experience. As Kawaguchi notes, “just receiving an instant response when transferring money between accounts or sending payments to suppliers and partners would be a significant improvement for many treasurers.”</p>
<p>With APIs simplifying the connectivity between a bank and the corporate client’s TMS or ERP system, once integrated, real-time data flow will lead to fewer instances of ad hoc requests for information from the corporate to the bank. As Kawaguchi comments, where these requests have previously been made via email or phone (and this is still a common occurrence), it can sometimes create “unnecessary delays”. For corporates to be able to track their payments, and perform reconciliations, without having to wait for batch runs or contact the banks, it is a major benefit.</p>
<h4 id="treasury-next-steps">Treasury next steps</h4>
<p>With APIs now at least on the radar of most treasurers, Kawaguchi believes that it is a good time to start talking to banking partners about their API roadmap. “APIs are here to stay, and treasurers must ensure that their banking partners have a strategy in place to optimise the opportunities available to them,” he advises. Of course, to be truly effective, that banking partner’s API strategy must match its own footprint, he adds. “Only that way will clients gain a consistent experience, regardless of geography.”</p>
<p>Besides gaining a deeper appreciation of current treasury processes, through mapping and analysis, he urges corporate treasurers to begin exploring the processes and drivers within other functions within the business. By doing so, it will ensure an understanding of where bank-hosted APIs can streamline transaction flows between the corporate and its own customers. With scope for re-usability of connections at almost every turn, the limit of possibilities stops only with the imagination.</p></div>

<p><em>With myriad complex processes, rules and regulations, trade has long remained highly paper-based, with manual processes that often seem resistant to change. Can distributed ledger technology (DLT) and blockchain ever become the industry standard – or are the barriers simply insurmountable?</em></p>

<div class="copy__body"><p>It goes without saying that many multinational companies have incredibly complex global supply chains. From the start of a trade transaction to its completion, each and every trade transaction must be verified, recorded and co-ordinated – often via intermediaries.</p>
<p>But what if these transactions could be verified autonomously? It would certainly remove a whole layer of complexity from this vast sector. This is the promise that DLT and blockchain have presented – but widespread adoption of this technology is likely to take considerable time and effort.</p>
<p>Recently, the Singapore branch of CIMB Bank Berhad completed a trade financing transaction for dairy imports using internet of things (IoT) cargo sensors and iTrust’s DLT platform. Meanwhile, promising initiatives have brought a wide range of benefits, from streamlining cargo checks to tracking the provenance of food. So is this the shape of things to come?</p>
<h4 id="dlt-vs-blockchain">DLT vs blockchain</h4>
<p>Before exploring the topic, it’s worth exploring the differences between DLT and blockchain. At their heart, DLT and blockchain share a conceptual origin: they are both decentralised and digitised logbooks of records.</p>
<p>However, given the wealth of information out there about blockchain and DLT, these terms are too often used interchangeably. In fact, blockchain is a specific type of DLT, in much the same way that an Audi is a specific type of car.</p>
<p>The term DLT refers to the technological infrastructure and protocols in place that allow various participants to access and manage records of data inside a decentralised database, or ledger. Think of it as a spreadsheet that develops through time.</p>
<p>As there is no central authority that acts as arbitrator or monitor, each participant can initiate, confirm and update information contained within the ledger. These records are only ever stored when all parties come to a consensus.</p>
<p>In comparison, blockchain is one form of DLT. Because of this it can exist without the need for a centralised authority or a server managing it – rather it is managed by peer-to-peer networks. Data on the blockchain is grouped together and organised in highly-encrypted ‘blocks’, which are linked together and secured with a cryptographic signature called a ‘hash’. The quality of the data therefore cannot be manipulated.</p>
<h4 id="shipping-competition-or-co-operation">Shipping – competition or co-operation?</h4>
<p>On the opening day of the Lloyd’s List Transparency in Shipping Forum last September, Peter McBurney, Head of Technology Consulting at Norton Rose Fulbright, compared the impact the internet had on businesses 30 years ago to the potential that blockchain has today. “If you lived and worked through that era, you will understand what an upheaval the internet was for businesses,” he said. “Blockchain is revolutionary technology and will transform industries across every sector.”</p>
<p>One such industry is in shipping – a notoriously competitive one which involves many parties with conflicting interests. Recent figures from the International Chamber of Shipping state that there are currently over 50,000 merchant ships operating across the globe at any one time.</p>
<p>Indeed, the international shipping trade has changed comparatively little since American businessman, Malcolm McClean, invented the intermodal sea container in 1956. Prior to this, the loading and unloading of freight was an expensive and often time-consuming task. With the advent of McClean’s sea container model, however, it became significantly cheaper and much more efficient to transport goods across the globe.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, what McClean’s revolutionary new container model did not solve was the cumbersome and bureaucratic processes that come with the transport of goods, including extensive paperwork. In 2017, research by IBM and Maersk found that the cost of handling documentation is so high that it can exceed the cost of transporting shipping containers. Indeed, the research found that a single container moving from Africa to Europe requires nearly 200 communications and the verification and approval of more than 30 organisations involved in customs, tax, and health-related matters.</p>
<h4 id="setting-a-new-course">Setting a new course</h4>
<p>These exchanges of information can take many forms, such as sales contracts, charter party agreements, bills of lading, port documents, letters of credit and more. And the documents involved can range from electronic files to hand-written delivery notes. Speaking at the Lloyd’s List Transparency in Shipping Forum, Sally-Ann Underhill, Partner at Reed Smith, backed up the findings of IBM and Maersk’s research. “The container side of the industry is seriously looking at blockchain,” she said.</p>
<p>This is because blockchain has the ability to make things so much cheaper. “In the container industry, savings of US$300 per container are not unheard of by using blockchain technology,” Underhill claims. “If a business has really reduced and low margins, these savings can make the difference between having a successful end of year or a really bad one.”</p>
<p>These potential savings simply back up the fact that, as the international trading model has become even more bureaucratic with the introduction of new rules and regulations, aspects of the shipping industry are in desperate need of a solution. This is particularly pertinent while geopolitical tensions, economic concerns and political uncertainty continue to cast a shadow over international trade.</p>
<p>For champions of blockchain and DLT, this technology has the potential to reduce not only the bureaucracy involved in global shipping, but also the amount of paper used – and, more importantly, the associated cost. Last year, a consortium including AB InBev, Accenture and Kuehne + Nagel successfully tested an ocean shipping blockchain solution and found that it reduced data entry requirements by up to 80%. Furthermore, the solution simplified data amendments, streamlined the checks required for cargo and reduced the burdens and risk of penalties associated with custom compliance.</p>
<p>But can the benefits of DLT and blockchain extend further than just reducing paperwork, costs and compliance? The retail sector has shown they can.</p>
<h4 id="savvy-shoppers-savvier-retailers">Savvy shoppers, savvier retailers?</h4>
<p>The high street is dying, or so they say. Earlier this year, research by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), compiled by The Local Data Company, found that Britain’s top 500 high streets saw net closures of 2,481 in 2018. The report attributed this in part to the high costs and risks of operating on the high street, compounded by advances in online retail.</p>
<p>If this trend continues, many more retailers will need to adapt their online systems and processes to cater for this shift in behaviour. But can blockchain provide the answer?</p>
<p>According to UK Finance, the collective voice for the banking and finance industry, retail losses due to online fraud totalled £265.1m in 2018, a rise of 29% on the previous year. For Ciaran McGowan, General Manager of trading platform we.trade, the solution is smart contracts on a blockchain network.</p>
<p>“The ideal scenario is a solution for all parties to be connected together,” says McGowan. “By using a blockchain smart contract, a trade is created where there is effectively a contract between the buyer, the seller, the buyer’s bank and the seller’s bank – so effectively, when all the conditions of the contract are met, then a payment is triggered.”</p>
<p>For retail it is this ability to track products across the supply chain that is a boon to the sector. But not only does blockchain have the potential to reduce fraud, it can also verify the provenance and origin of a product, eliminate the risk of counterfeits (particularly in luxury goods) – and it has already proven itself to have benefits when it comes to food safety.</p>
<p>Last year, Walmart teamed up with IBM to produce a food safety blockchain solution, built using open source DLT Hyperledger Fabric and running on IBM Cloud. Prior to launch, it took Walmart approximately seven days to trace the source of produce. With the new blockchain solution this was reduced to 2.2 seconds – making it much less likely that infected food will reach the consumer.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>“Our customers deserve a more transparent supply chain,” said Frank Yiannas, Vice President of food safety for Walmart in a statement. “We felt the one-step-up and one-step-back model of food traceability was outdated for the 21<sup>st</sup> century. This is a smart, technology-supported move that will greatly benefit our customers and transform the food system, benefitting all stakeholders.”</p>
<p>Indeed, corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability is growing in importance for today’s retailers and customers alike. Last year, the French supermarket chain Carrefour also launched Europe’s first ever food blockchain. Starting with free range chickens, each product label now features a unique QR code which consumers can scan with their smartphone. Not only does this provide them with information about the product, it also shows the journey the chicken has taken – from farm to store. In addition, the code gives the name of the farmer, what feed was used and whether the animal has been treated with antibiotics, for example.</p>
<h4 id="the-state-of-play">The state of play</h4>
<p>Regardless of the potential for the global trade industry, blockchain is far from maturity, and there are many challenges that must be overcome before it can be successfully applied across the board.</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest challenge for the trade industry is the need to gain universal adoption. There is no doubt that the ability to exchange information accurately and safely across any supply chain is a boon to stakeholders. After all, the more stakeholders take up the technology, the more viable and practical it becomes, and this should lead to it becoming the industry standard. However, organisations are at varying levels of digital readiness, and not all recognise the benefits of DLT and blockchain collaboration.</p>
<p>This is a point made by Sarah Hazzledine, Managing Director at Accenture: “This is a question that desperately needs an answer, as adoption is all about getting the network effect. How do you get the right number of players onto the network to actually make it viable? I think that’s the biggest challenge rather than the technology itself.”</p>
<p>Hazzledine notes that across several consortiums in the industry, adoption has been tentative due to ambiguity around how competitors can collaborate on blockchain initiatives. “Those that have been successful to date consider the needs of all parties,” she says. “Players in the shipping space don’t want to join a network that is seen as owned and driven by an industry giant.”</p>
<p>It is a point endorsed by Lloyd’s List’s Managing Editor Richard Meade: “Maersk and IBM are currently the shipping equivalent of Uber, so unless the industry embraces blockchain and comes up with their own solutions, they will simply become Uber drivers – and that’s not quite as profitable I would say.”</p>
<p>Other critics of blockchain argue that inherent problems with blockchain technology itself will need to be ironed out before it can be applied on such a large scale. The first is latency. Some implementations of the technology have not scaled up significantly enough to cope with the huge demand in processing transactions, and as a result performance has suffered.</p>
<p>In addition, with so many transactions happening across the globe, there are serious issues with the amount of energy required to power the network. For treasury, this weighs heavily on its organisation’s sustainability agenda. Although the amount of paper used will be reduced dramatically, it could be at the expense of increasing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>
<p>However, Hazzledine points out that this is not a concern for private networks. “Public blockchains such as Bitcoin are resource intensive due to the amount of energy required for data miners to do proof of work – but this is not indicative of what is going on in private networks where proof of work is not required.”</p>
<h4 id="the-journey-ahead">The journey ahead</h4>
<p>Another problem for global trade is the increasing regulation in different industries. For example, standards and governance in the shipping industry differ greatly from the road haulage industry. As such there will likely be a number of different networks established at different times, all serving different goals.</p>
<p>This is highlighted in a recent research paper on blockchain’s potential by Christine McDaniel, economist and trade expert from the Mercatus Centre at George Mason University. “Integrating blockchain technology in the customs process will require technological updates and the cooperation of customs officials, governments, shippers, and suppliers,” the report claims. “This cooperation may be harder to achieve in industries where particular businesses work to manipulate public policy or economic conditions as a strategy to increase profits.”</p>
<p>Therefore a collaborative mindset across each industry is needed, and a culture of embracing new opportunities from this new technology should be nurtured. This can be achieved if IT departments gain the knowledge and practical first-hand experience required to implement it across the board.</p>
<p>Enno-Burghard Weitzel, Head of Product Management Trade Services at Commerzbank echoes this sentiment: “In the future, it will be possible to completely integrate all corporate enterprise resource planning systems, including all supply chain stakeholders on DLT based platforms,” he says. “This will lead to an increased level of transparency on the whole supply chain and enable end-to-end data flows. Furthermore, in the not-too-distant future we will be able to create digital twins, thereby linking the real world and the digital world.”</p>
<p>While certain issues will need to be ironed out, there remains hope that they can be solved within the next two to five years. Indeed, McGowan is very positive for the future, as he believes that there will be a revolution with the emergence of the IoT, artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain.</p>
<p>“I expect blockchain will be more than just ‘farm-to-fork’ scenarios across the global trade industry as suppliers and customers will soon be able to track the correct weight of the cargo and even its current temperature,” he says. “Should the goods be damaged on delivery or be of poor quality, AI will be able to calculate the right amount of discount applied.”</p>
<p>Regardless of the thoughts of supporters or critics of blockchain, the benefits are so significant that it seems likely the technology will have a major role to play in shaping the future of global trade. After all, Rome wasn’t built in a day, but its empire changed the world.</p></div>

<p> </p>
<p>“Today, technology is evolving rapidly. The treasury landscape and, in particular, the payments landscape, is evolving rapidly. Regulation across the globe is pushing forward innovation – driven hard by an explosion of fintech activity – and the user experience is taking centre stage.” So said Steven Lenaerts, Head of Product Management Global Channels at BNP Paribas, as he introduced a recent webinar looking at the place of open banking in a regulated world.</p>
<p>So, what is open banking? In formal terms, it can be defined as a collaborative model in which banking data is shared between unaffiliated parties to deliver enhanced capabilities to the marketplace.</p>
<p>In practice, noted Stephanie Niemi, Deputy Head of Product Management Global Channels at BNP Paribas, “it allows bank customers more choice in the use and sharing of their data with third-party applications in a secure, real-time and resilient fashion, while enabling a broader range of services”.</p>
<p>Even regulators have responded to the opportunity that this can bring, enabling open banking to open up competition and foster innovation to the benefit of the end-user.</p>
<p>In January 2018, the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) came into force in Europe, with the CMA in the UK providing for open banking. In APAC, Singapore and Hong Kong are leading the way towards open banking. Here, initiatives have been driven by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority respectively. The same shift is coming to the United States, again driven by market forces and consumer choice.</p>
<p>The chapters in PSD2 of particular interest – in addition to sections on payments processing rules and incident management reporting – are those covering secure customer communication (SCA) and open communication standards (OCS).</p>
<p>In response to this regulatory push, the industry has launched a number of initiatives tackling the challenges raised by open banking. In Europe, for example, initiatives include those organised by the Berlin Group, STET and Openbanking.org.uk on open communications standards, the FIDO Alliance, and CAPS on secure customer authentication.</p>
<p>Although PSD2 is an extension of PSD1 – especially in terms of processing rules and value dating of payments with at least one leg in the European Union – it also includes rules on strong customer authentication and open communication standards.</p>

</figure>
<p>Through these rules, PSD2 enables third-party providers (TPPs) to act as an intermediary between the payment service user and the account holding bank. It defines minimum-security requirements, creating a level playing field between the different actors in the market – and the minimum services offered by such intermediaries that banks must support.</p>
<p>The current scope of PSD2 covers payment accounts and the minimum services cover, access to account information, and the possibility to initiate payments from these accounts. While the spirit of the regulation is very much aimed at retail banking and private individuals, corporates and corporate banking are covered by the regulation.</p>
<p>Implementation guidelines – defined in the regulatory technical standards (RTS) – have been issued. In March 2018, these were ratified by the relevant European regulatory bodies marking the start of the 18-month transition period, after which all actors in the market must comply.</p>
<p>Given the volume of discussion heard recently about APIs (application programming interfaces) Lenaerts explained that an API is “nothing more than an intelligent pipe enabling data exchange between systems”. He added that BNP Paribas intends to publish its first cash management APIs in the fourth quarter of 2018.</p>
<p>For Niemi, the whole concept of open banking is “merely a means to an end”. It is, she noted, premised on value creation via an optimal user experience, delivered through progressive innovation. “As we have seen in the past, individual users consuming retail banking services will be the breeding ground for this idea but the corporate space will follow, considering its own particularities.”</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>Over the past few years, APIs have received greater attention in financial services. Treasury Today Asia explores the benefits of APIs and discusses how this technology is set to impact treasury.</em></p>
<p> Before the advent of digital forms of communication, correspondence involved sending physical letters that took a day – or longer – to arrive. Today, using digital communication channels such as email and WeChat, individuals and businesses can communicate in a standardised way in near-real time whenever they need to.</p>
<p>The introduction of open application programme interfaces (APIs) into financial services is set to create a similar revolution in terms of how banks service their customers by facilitating the shift from batch processing to real-time processing. To provide an illustrative example, today corporates may receive details about their account balances at set times through SWIFT MT940 messages. In an API enabled world, there would be no need to wait: corporates would be able to access up-to-date balance information via their TMS, ERP or online banking portal in near real-time.</p>
<p>This is just one application of APIs that will benefit treasury departments. However, the transformative power of APIs will not only change how treasurers consume banking services – it will also give treasurers the chance to change the role that they play within the organisation.</p>
<h3 id="apis-101">APIs 101</h3>
<p>Before diving into the transformational impact of APIs, it is worth spending some time explaining what they are, how they work and where they come from. In brief, howstuffworks.com says that an API is “a set of programming instructions and standards for accessing a web-based software application or web tool”.</p>
<p>To expand on this, APIs essentially enable different applications to speak to each other without any user knowledge or action. In doing so, they allow an application to be programmed so that it can seamlessly access a host of different services. The aim is to add value and provide a better experience for the end user.</p>
<p>ProgrammableWeb – a magazine that covers APIs – compares the technology to a plug socket. It explains that around the world, a plug socket acts as an interface to a service (such as electricity). The plug socket can then be used to power all manner of different applications. Likewise, aside from a few differences around the world, plug sockets look and behave the same. Consequently, they provide a standardised way for applications to connect to the electrical grid – just like APIs.</p>
<p>While it may seem that APIs are a completely new concept – especially when used in discussions around financial services – they have actually been around for quite some time. Indeed, forms of APIs first existed in the ‘60s. Over time APIs have evolved, become more robust and found more use cases. Today they are synonymous with internet-based services.</p>
<p>As a result, many of us use APIs every day – often without realising. For example, Uber connects to several different APIs, such as Google Maps, a digital wallet and a communications platform, to deliver its services. In doing so, Uber does not have to develop its own maps, payment service and communication platform and can instead access best of breed solutions that have made their APIs open to consumption. For the end user, this means they never have to leave the app, can interact with it in real-time and ultimately, receive a good customer experience.</p>

<h3 id="gateway-to-the-real-time-revolution">Gateway to the real-time revolution</h3>
<p>Within financial services, APIs have become more prominent in recent years. A few factors are forcing this to happen, but the most powerful is arguably the regulatory pressure in Europe from PSD2. The new regulation mandates that banks publish open APIs to allow application service providers (ASPs) and payment service providers (PSPs) to offer overlay services.</p>
<p>Whilst there is not a similar regulatory mandate in Asia, the regulators are closely watching what is happening in Europe and are developing their own API strategies. As Morgan McKenney, Head of Core Cash Asia, Treasury and Trade Solutions at Citi, explains: “Regulators across Asia Pacific are promoting digitisation and developing real-time payment infrastructures for lower value domestic bank account payments and collections. By 2020, most countries in the region will have some form of real-time payment infrastructure. These payment systems are all API enabled and designed so that market players can plug into them and build services that benefit the end-users of financial services in those countries.”</p>
<p>The most advanced country in Asia in this respect is India, where the government has built a host of advanced API enabled financial systems that banks can plug into. This has enabled banks such as Citi and others to create new and exciting value propositions for their clients. “Citi’s Request to Pay solution for institutional clients in India is one of the most obvious examples of how APIs can help banks offer real-time services for seamless digital collections from bank accounts,” says McKenney.</p>
<p>The solution leverages India’s Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) infrastructure and enables consumers to make real-time bank debits from their account using a tokenised address, such as an email. For eCommerce companies selling in India, where card penetration is low, this solution opens the door to a much broader range of customers and gives them a low-cost collection method.</p>
<h3 id="delivering-better-services">Delivering better services</h3>
<p>In Asia, many banks are not waiting for the regulators to mandate APIs and instead are charging ahead with their own API strategies and enabled solutions. Citi, for example, has published its own Treasury and Trade Solutions suite of APIs, which enables developers to build services that can be consumed by Citi’s clients. Meanwhile, HSBC will soon be rolling out a solution to SMEs in Hong Kong that will enable them to see their account balances across all their API enabled banks through HSBC’s web portal.</p>
<p>HSBC is also working with a host of API enabled service providers to offer these services to its clients. “APIs are giving banks the opportunity to be more collaborative with the wider financial ecosystem and quickly leverage services created by third parties that can offer genuine value to our clients,” says Jennifer Doherty, Asia Head of Innovation for Global Liquidity and Cash Management at HSBC.</p>
<p>As well as pushing banks to be more collaborative, APIs are also helping to highlight the fact that banks cannot be the best at everything. “As a bank, our core strength is in finance, not necessarily technology,” says Doherty. “Once we realise this, the barriers go down and we become more willing to work with others and offer their services through APIs to our clients – it is a win-win for everyone.”</p>
<p>This point is echoed by Gautam Jain, MD and Global Head, Digitisation &amp; Client Access, Transaction Banking at Standard Chartered. “It is about delivering services that offer convenience, efficiency and a good experience for our customers,” he says. “And if that means we have to leverage third-party solutions and offer these through APIs, then so be it.”</p>

<h3 id="innovative-thinking">Innovative thinking</h3>
<p>For Imad Abou Haidar, Managing Director, APAC at Finastra, the emergence of APIs is also allowing banks to become more innovative. Finastra, which provides technology solutions to banks, has been progressive with its own API strategy, making its entire suite of products API enabled and allowing third parties to build services on top of its offerings to drive innovation.</p>
<p>“It is about breaking down financial services into small consumable chunks that can be upgraded without impacting the rest of the technology stack,” he says. “This allows banks to focus in on the areas that matter for their customers and innovate more effectively by leveraging third-party solutions or building their own solutions in house.”</p>
<p>The ultimate beneficiary of this will be the end user of financial services. “APIs will give banks the ability to offer much more flexible and customisable services to their customers,” says Abou Haidar. “For instance, at a basic level, the banks will be able to deliver better bespoke information – like the current price of crude for an oil company – through their client’s banking portal. That will be useful for them in their day-to-day work.”</p>
<p>At a more advanced level, Abou Haidar sees programmable APIs as the facilitators of an even greater experience for corporate treasurers. “Using APIs to stitch together a host of other technologies and services means that the banks could offer bespoke advice around where to invest cash, what cash might be needed later in the week and so forth,” he says. “This is a genuine value-added service and those banks that offer it will put themselves ahead of the rest.”</p>
<p>Banks will undoubtedly move at different paces and in different directions when it comes down to their use of APIs. However, it is clear that it is the direction all will have to move in. “In our personal lives we hold the providers we use very accountable for the service they provide and expect high standards,” says HSBC’s Doherty. “This hasn’t always been the case in the institutional space. However, corporate treasurers are human and as they experience improved services in their personal life they are demanding an improved service at work as well. If they do not receive this from their current providers, they will simply find a provider that can.”</p>
<h3 id="taking-the-lead">Taking the lead</h3>
<p>While many of the API services they consume will be delivered by banks, treasurers should not be passive consumers of the API revolution. Citi’s McKenney says that treasurers should begin to understand how this technology might aid their business, and that they should begin to develop their own internal API strategies.</p>
<p>“What is happening through APIs and real-time infrastructures is that banks are laying down the platform for corporates to leverage in multiple different use cases,” says McKenney. “As a result, treasurers need to work with their businesses to understand how APIs and real-time payments can benefit their own companies’ product offerings and drive business growth, as well as increase treasury efficiency.</p>
<p>“We have one client, for instance, that worked with the business to launch a real-time collections programme using APIs that connected to a popular e-wallet solution,” adds McKenney. “In a few months, the solution digitised 50% of the company’s cash, creating huge cost savings. It also gave the company a lot more data that it could use to better understand its customer’s behaviour and build solutions that enhance revenue. This solution was treasury-led and only made possible because of the emergence of APIs.”</p>
<h3 id="an-api-future-for-all">An API future for all</h3>
<p>Ultimately, it is clear that the future of banking will be API enabled. What this future will look like and what it means for those that consume financial services remains up for debate. Many believe that the future of banks and financial services will look very different.</p>
<p>No matter what, it will be good news for treasurers. If customer-centricity really is the aim of the banks, as they often claim, then the collaborative model will not only help bring the best possible solutions to market, but will also encourage banks to be the best they can be in terms of service delivery. From this perspective, APIs are well positioned to kick-start the next generation of corporate banking services.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>The bank agnostic technology model is increasingly sought by treasurers eager not to put all their eggs in one basket. It is a risk management quest but it is also one of operational and cost efficiency. Treasury Today considers the benefits and drawbacks of stepping beyond the world of bank proprietary technology.</em></p>
<p>As the compulsion to work with bank proprietary electronic services slowly loosens its grip on the corporate community, treasurers are finding themselves readily able to exchange information with multiple banks using common channels and standard formats from a broad range of providers. They also have control of their payments mechanisms so that treasurers can effectively “turn banks on and off,” as one practitioner speaking at last year’s EuroFinance event in Budapest succinctly put it.</p>
<p>Indeed, that same individual offered his reasons for taking this path by describing his ideal of treasury management as “definitely not logging into six or seven different banking platforms each day nor trying to recover 150 accounts when a parting of the ways with a bank means unpicking what had been snarled up in a proprietary platform.” With this in mind, the concept of bank agnostic technology certainly sounds ideal, but is it?</p>
<h3 id="why-and-why-not">Why… and why not?</h3>
<p>There are three main benefits of a bank agnostic approach: reduced cost and effort when changing banks; the ability to harmonise processes; and the potential for improved efficiency. When ranked against a multi-bank structure where counterparty and performance risks are a genuine concern, it has certain appeal.</p>
<p>One company that has found benefit in bank agnosticism is Etihad Airways. Currently, the airline has 50 transactional banking relationships across the globe. Etihad is going through a major global connectivity project and is using a SWIFT service bureau (Fundtech) to drive efficiencies, explains Deputy Treasurer, Adam Boukadida. “This is enabling connectivity with multiple banks in multiple parts of the world.” By employing a bureau to implement and operate SWIFT, in partnership with treasury and the internal IT function, he says it enables the team to focus more on day-to-day activities and value-add projects.</p>
<p>Although progress towards an agnostic model could be seen as an attempt to put banks on the back foot in the overall balance of power, Boukadida certainly does not see it as “preventing or damaging any of our banking relationships.” Rather, he says, “the desire for more bank agnostic models is driven by treasurers wanting to be able to exchange information with multiple banks using common standards, eliminating any duplication of effort and minimising counterparty risks.”</p>
<p>There are clear benefits for some treasurers, however, in certain emerging markets, bank agnosticism is still only just on the radar. Luke Waddington, Head of Global Markets, E-Business, BNP Paribas, notes that the uptake of bank agnostic platforms is “somewhat sluggish” in Asia. “There needs to be improvement in the pre-trade and post-trade areas as bank agnostic platforms are largely geared around execution,” he explains.</p>
<p>The persistence of proprietary offerings looks set for some time as corporate adoption of bank agnostic connectivity such as SWIFT remains relatively slow. And whilst owning the network and the systems seems advantageous for the treasurer, the benefits come at the cost of being responsible for it, says Marc Vandiepenbeeck, Corporate Treasurer, Asia Pacific, Johnson Controls. “The major advantage of a bank proprietary platform is that the company shares it with all the other customers of the bank, benefitting from a larger scale infrastructure which, more often than not, is very reliable.” Taking ownership of that infrastructure means the treasury team is responsible for the normal downtime that any system can and will face. Managing that new risk internally is thus “a challenge in and of itself.”</p>
<h3 id="taking-action">Taking action</h3>
<p>If the decision is taken to move ahead, there are four major treasury processes that can be disconnected from the proprietary environment, notes Vandiepenbeeck. These are payments, cash application, trade finance and FX and MM trading. Multi-bank online trading platforms already have a broad adoption of course, with providers such as FXall (Thomson Reuters), 360T, ICD and MyTreasury linking many of the major FIs in this space with corporate treasurers the world over. In the trade finance space there have been some positive recent developments (including SWIFT’s BPO) but the adoption rate has been less enthusiastic, particularly from Vandiepenbeeck’s Asian perspective. “This is mostly due to local regulation and challenges associated with the fact that a lot of economies in Asia are either paper-driven or rely on paper for final release of goods.”</p>
<p>However, it is the payment processing space that is the most advanced in terms of bank agnosticism. File formats have to a degree been standardised over time, with SWIFT offering corporate connectivity for a number of years through MT101/103 messaging. “Assuming a corporate uses its own SWIFT infrastructure, all payment files can easily be ported from one bank to the next, reducing the friction cost of changing bank,” he states. There are other clear benefits with this, including the facilitation of standardised connectivity between the ERP and payment factories and better control over users, signatories and approvers.</p>
<p>The cash application process mostly involves electronic bank statements. Again, SWIFT formats, like the MT940/942 have helped improve the standardisation of these statements but not fully (see ArcelorMittal case study below). Indeed, Vandiepenbeeck notes that each bank will have its own limitations, often driven by legacy systems and slow adoption of SWIFT standards. “This is particularly true in Asia where certain markets are falling behind because of the complexity of the information that needs to be contained in a statement.”</p>
<h3 id="case-study-the-in-house-cash-pool">Case study: the in-house cash pool</h3>
<p>The pursuit of bank independent structures means that an infrastructure needs to be put in place, the initial investment of which can be large – and this is only recuperated through process efficiencies and increased control over bank fees. These only make sense when the organisation is complex enough and when the volumes justify taking control of the transmission channel.</p>
<p>ArcelorMittal is one such business. It is one of the world’s leading steel and mining companies, supplying all major markets via a presence in 60 countries and an industrial footprint in 19. Laurent Guillouët is its Head of Cash Management &amp; Back Office Financial Transactions for ArcelorMittal Group Treasury. His department directly manages cash for about 90 group entities but connects to more than 400 companies in total, including holding companies and purely operational businesses, whose treasuries are participants in a bank-agnostic in-house cash-pooling structure which ArcelorMittal first established over 20 years ago.</p>
<p>Today, the global cash pooling structure covers 29 currencies taking in around 40 banking partners and over 900 accounts. “One of the main interests of having cash pooling operated by ourselves is to be independent from the banks,” explains Guillouët. In effect, treasury is free to work with any bank it chooses without affecting the management of the structure whereas he feels that dependence on multiple banking systems creates difficulties for the kind of centralisation strategy that has been part of treasury for many years.</p>
<p>The hub of the centralised structure is in Paris but two years ago an additional treasury centre was set up in Chicago, taking care of all the Americas business. From here on out, ArcelorMittal has deployed an integrated Treasury Management System (TMS) using both in-house developed tools and third-party systems (such as for accounting and managing commodity and energy deals). The key to success with such a mix has been full integration, says Guillouët, adding that the connectivity solution itself is a purely in-house development. With its own secure intranet, the entire group can now participate in the cash pool regardless of location.</p>
<h3 id="quality-first">Quality first</h3>
<p>Of course, a bank agnostic system does not mean cutting out bank relationships. Whilst these remain as important to the treasurer as ever, it does mean greater control over those partners: Guillouët is watching. “When I send an order to a bank I will define a cut-off time. At the end of the year I will count the number of times my order was not executed correctly and how many were executed without error,” he states.</p>
<p>Should a bank experience temporary technical or administrative issues, the in-house pooling structure enables treasury to easily redirect its flows to another provider without too much difficulty. The speed with which the flow of business can be switched off completely if the bank continues to fail in its delivery is considerably higher than if tied to a bank proprietary system.</p>
<h3 id="going-agnostic">Going agnostic</h3>
<p>To achieve the kind of structure used by ArcelorMittal, a committed investment is required in terms of money and resources warns Guillouët. And it takes time too: “If you decided at the beginning of the year to do this you will not achieve it by the end of the year.”</p>
<p>Having established a firm base with one local bank (a French company would most likely have chosen a French bank simply to establish the easiest path of communication), it will then be possible to enlarge the structure. “One key point in doing that is to acquire SWIFTNet connectivity,” he says. But, notes Guillouët, the lack of standardisation of message types (usually MT940s) means that each time the structure is taken further afield it may be necessary to develop the local format. He believes the new SWIFT ISO 20022 camt messages (.052 account reporting, .053 account statements and .054 credit or debit notifications) will be a great improvement – once they are in full circulation. “But today I don’t have a single bank that is able to send messages using any of those formats with the planned enrichments.”</p>
<h3 id="collect-and-survive">Collect and survive</h3>
<p>In the context of a multi-banked global or large MNC, the difficulties of effective automation, centralisation and standardisation of data flows are immediately apparent. In an acquisitive business or where emerging markets are a significant feature this is even more so. “It is surprising how many very large companies still have cash scattered around the world and no visibility on it,” notes Eric Bayle, Director, Head of Payments &amp; Cash Management, UK, for Société Générale. He believes the real goal for corporate treasurers in this situation should be to optimise their current processes.</p>
<p>But as we have seen with ArcelorMittal, the future of this relatively simple yet effective measure depends to an extent upon the uptake of SWIFT’s XML-based camt messaging standards. At the moment Bayle acknowledges that there are very few banks that are able to send these message types. This may be about to change as SWIFT seeks to promote XML’s further adoption with, bank agnosticism in mind.</p>
<h3 id="standardising-the-standards">Standardising the standards</h3>
<p>With the SWIFT MT940/942 messages currently key to acquiring the basic cash position data, André Casterman, Global Head, Corporate and Supply Chain Markets, SWIFT, acknowledges that the format is not perfect. Although the header fields (the main fields) are standardised, when it comes to line item information, corporates and banks have tended to agree on different ‘standards’ according to need. “There is room for more standardisation in the MT940s, and this is what we have achieved with the ISO 20022 camt messages,” he explains. Obviously support is required to make inroads and he reports that camt.053 flows between banks and corporates grew by 143% between H1 2014 and H1 2015; although the actual starting point is not known uptake is clearly going in the right direction.</p>
<p>The camt.053, as the MT940 equivalent, is the main subject of promotion by SWIFT today. In Europe, SEPA has acted as a boost for awareness of ISO 20022 messaging. “Corporates involved in SEPA are increasingly keen to move payment flows into an ISO 20022 environment,” notes Casterman. “In Asia we have already seen some MNCs adopt an ISO 20022-only approach, only using SWIFT MT messages when ISO 20022 is not available.” This is clearly intended to help those firms overcome the issue of multiple bank proprietary technologies across a diverse region and to this end SWIFT proposes to increase the level of bank and vendor certification requirements to include this message type.</p>
<p>But Casterman knows that there is a need for more than just new message-types; there is a need to manage market practices, to avoid one side imposing its view on the other and unsettling the standardisation of processes. “The decision of each bank is driven by commercial needs; if a large corporate imposes its format onto its banks, those banks will often agree to that. This is why standards are often implemented in various ways,” he explains. Being overly prescriptive is not achievable in the short term so SWIFT has developed a number of tools to try to help corporates and banks work together more efficiently.</p>
<p>The key to agreement is the CGI-MP (Common Global Implementation-market practice) Group. This is the new, more focused name for the old CGI. The CGI initiative includes more than 50 participating organisations, including banks, corporates, SWIFT, vendors and consultants. It is an attempt to forge a true standard for all, and now includes all ISO 20022 messages.</p>
<p>In practice, CGI-MP seeks to build a uniform layer on top of the basic message formats. It recommends how these messages should be best used in the corporate world. Banks can still develop their own specifications on top of CGI-MP as a third layer as they will have some competitive proprietary tools that require this, but these specifications should be documented in the SWIFT standards repository, known as MyStandards, and are freely accessible by corporates either directly or via their own participating bank. This still means treasurers have to test their messages to see if they meet the necessary standards when moving or adding new banks. With precisely this in mind, the MyStandards Readiness Portal is the SWIFT facility for corporate-client use. This is an online automated, self-service message testing tool that provides a single view of testing activity across multiple parties. In practice, when testing a message against a bank specification, any errors or mismatches will generate a response that describes what is wrong. The user will then be directed to the bank’s relevant field definition in MyStandards so that the message can be modified accordingly whilst still online and retested straight away.</p>
<h3 id="a-clear-role">A clear role</h3>
<p>As many large corporates and MNCs continue their journey towards centralisation, automation and standardisation, so centralised treasuries, shared service centres, payment factories and on-behalf-of operations become the norm. Communication between entities, functions and units of operation benefits from standardisation of systems and data formats – and this is where the bank-agnostic model has a chief role to play in improving integration and flow between internal systems and bank services. It is a simple and yet effective approach, but it requires commitment from the outset.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>In Asia Pacific (APAC), there is a demand – especially in the MNC space – for bank agnostic offerings. As the region covers a range of different geographies, it’s quite expensive from a treasury perspective to be able to deal in all of the countries required. Here, we see a trend for corporates to operate a centralised treasury model (as much as possible), from a regional ‘hub’ from which they can carry out operations and transactions across all of the different geographies. A bank such as BNP Paribas, with a presence in 14 markets in APAC, can offer quite a lot of the functionality required by corporate centralisation – but not all banks operate with such scope. Therefore, there is a gap in the market which a rising number of multi-dealer platforms are filling. They provide the functionality for a corporate to operate centrally but deal across the region, adhering to local regulations and restrictions.</p>
<p>Despite pick-up in the use of bank agnostic platforms, there remain some regional considerations. In APAC, there are restricted currencies and various regulations around transactions in the payments space, for instance, where the execution of those services has to remain onshore in that particular country. This introduces complexity in terms of the workflow; ensuring compliance, but also trying to give a degree of scale and central management to that process. For BNP Paribas, it is a case of making sure the appropriate technical workflows are in place onshore to deal with regulation and any restrictions. But, for every bank to do that individually, it is quite expensive. A central platform can act almost as a universal utility for both the bank and client in a cost-efficient manner.</p>
<p>Moreover, beneficial for corporates is the competitiveness that platforms bring to the market. By having aggregated services, they get the opportunity of aggregated pricing. Another advantage that corporate treasurers should be looking at is that of desktop ‘real estate’ considerations. For many companies, they have multiple banks servicing them and the ability to display data from each on one desktop is a challenge. A multi-dealer platform allows everything to be consolidated in one space and easily allows corporates to either work with their banks in aggregate or through an individual correspondent.</p>
<p>The uptake of bank agnostic platforms is somewhat sluggish in Asia. The reasons are understandable as there needs to be improvement in the pre-trade and post-trade areas as bank agnostic platforms are largely geared around execution. Certain abilities are not available on platforms: access to account balances, deposit balances and revaluation statements, the ability to roll deposits and interact with actioned transactions and access to research on certain markets, for instance. So, although there will be a rise in bank agnostic execution, there will always be a place for the banks’ delivery of those services.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Bank agnostic operating models may be more widespread in the Western world, but their popularity in Asia is quickly catching up. And, whilst it goes without saying that every region has its own challenges, Asia needn’t be seen as such a maze for corporates to operate in any more. This is largely due to technology developments over the last few years: SWIFT service bureaux, and other middleware providers, can assist corporates in ensuring the formatting and regulation requirements for Asia are handled in the same manner as they would be in any other region – whilst simultaneously supporting the adoption of a less bank-reliant operating model. And this is something Asian corporates are embracing: SWIFT reported that APAC is one of the fastest growing regions in terms of payment traffic volumes, experiencing a 12.6% increase in the year to date.</p>
<p>Using our experience as an example, at the moment Etihad Airways is going through a major global connectivity project and is experiencing first-hand the benefits of using a SWIFT bureau, enabling connectivity with multiple banks in multiple parts of the world. Currently, the airline has 50 transactional banking relationships across the globe. The major benefit for Etihad treasury is, whilst we are gaining end-to-end straight through processing (STP), by employing Fundtech to implement and operate SWIFT in partnership with us and our IT function, the team can focus more on the day-to-day treasury activities and further value-add projects.</p>
<p>Moreover, we do not see progress towards an agnostic model preventing or damaging any of our banking relationships. Rather, the desire for more bank agnostic models is driven by treasurers wanting to be able to exchange information with multiple banks using common standards, eliminating any duplication of effort and minimising counterparty risks. It may also soothe any communication pains that might have existed in the past when dealing with varying cultures and could, in fact, open up more opportunity for relationships with banks in less-developed parts of the world – all because you can have that single communication channel.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many different operating models that a corporate can select to achieve the ultimate end goal. So although for us, it was a clear choice to appoint a SWIFT bureau due to Etihad’s global network, I am aware of smaller corporates that have deployed SWIFT Lite2 themselves. It depends on the requirements of the business. However, my advice for other corporates hoping to gain the benefits of adopting a co-operative network, such as SWIFT, would be to avoid looking at technology in a silo but rather how such an agnostic model would work with the overall treasury infrastructure – ERPs and general ledger systems, for instance, and all the way through to a fully centralised treasury.</p></div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>The main drivers for a bank agnostic approach are: the reduced costs when changing banks, the ability to harmonise processes and the potential for improved efficiency. These three drivers are relevant in the context of a multi-bank structure when counterparty and performance risks are a concern. The greater the number of banks (and frequency of change), the larger the value of moving away from the proprietary processes will be.</p>
<p>There are four major treasury processes that can be disconnected from the proprietary environment, namely: payments, cash application, trade finance and foreign exchange trading. I will not cover the latter since online trading platforms already have a broad adoption.</p>
<p>Payment processing is the most advanced of all. File formats have been standardised over time and SWIFT has been offering capabilities to corporates for over a decade now (MT101/103). Assuming a corporate uses its own SWIFT infrastructure, all payment files can easily be ported from one bank to the next, thereby reducing the friction cost of changing bank. The other clear benefits are: allowing standardised connectivity between the ERP and payment factories and better control over users, signatories and approvers. The second process, cash application, mostly involves electronic bank statements. Again, SWIFT formats, like the MT940/942, have helped improve the standardisation of these statements. However, each bank has its own limitations, often driven by legacy systems and slow adoption of SWIFT standards – this is particularly true in Asia with certain markets falling behind because of the complexity of the information that needs to be contained in a statement.</p>
<p>Finally, trade finance has seen some positive recent developments (SWIFT for Trade, TSU and BPO initiatives, for instance). But the adoption rate has not been as rapid as for the first two processes, particularly in Asia. This is mostly due to local regulation and challenges associated with the fact that a lot of economies in Asia are either paper-driven or rely on paper for final goods/payments/custom release. Language, character support and other technical challenges are also forcing corporates to rely on email or bank proprietary platforms for trade finance-related processes.</p>
<p>At Johnson Controls in Asia, payments and cash application processes have been implemented that allow for centralised processing and management of payables and collections in one single shared service centre. For other corporates, there are important factors that would influence such a project: size and volumes. The pursuit of bank independent structures means that an infrastructure needs to be put in place; the initial investment of which can be large and is only recuperated through process efficiencies and increased control over bank fees. These make sense when the organisation is complex enough and when the volumes justify taking control of the transmission channel.</p>
<p>Besides owning the network and systems seeming, at first, an obvious opportunity for a treasurer, the benefits come at the cost of being responsible for it. The major advantage of a bank proprietary platform is that the company shares it with all the other customers of the bank, benefitting from a larger scale infrastructure which, more often than not, is very reliable. Taking ownership of that infrastructure means the treasury team is responsible for the normal downtime that any system can and will face. Managing that new risk, internally, is a challenge in and of itself.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>As the messaging service provider for most of the systemically important payment and securities clearing systems in the world, SWIFT is what is known as a ‘critical financial market infrastructure’. It would be reasonable to view the global corporate community as a major player within that system and yet back in 2007, at SWIFT’s own Sibos event, the assembled stakeholders were informed that business users were not necessarily feeling part of the process.</p>
<p>At the event, held that year in Boston, the then Virgin Atlantic Group Treasurer, Alex Harris (now at Al Muhaidib Group in Saudi Arabia), commented in a plenary session that while it was recognised SWIFT had made progress in “lowering the barriers to entry”, the corporate access model was “weighted heavily in favour of the very large multinationals”. Furthermore, banks were regarded as “reacting very slowly, especially to the needs of mid-market firms”.</p>
<p>Harris certainly had a point: the few corporates that were interested in accessing SWIFT directly had to sign up to the cumbersome Member-Administered Closed User Group (MA-CUG) model and only the major multinationals could justify the effort and expense. However, since the introduction in 2004 of SWIFT’s single closed user group, Standardised Corporate Environment (SCORE), corporates have been able to use transaction banking functionality via the network, communicating with any bank that is part of their group. Whilst SCORE promised to ease much of the MA-CUG pain, it has been apparent that not all banks know about or wish to subscribe to SCORE. This in part has limited the usefulness of corporate membership.</p>
<p>With the growth of the emerging markets, particularly in Asia Pacific, the issue of awareness and access may be about to change for the better and Joan Lee, Director of Corporate Markets, Asia Pacific, for SWIFT says the industry cooperative is on the case.</p>
<h3 id="asia-in-sight">Asia in sight</h3>
<p>In 2007, SWIFT had started rolling out its corporate access model in Asia. Having matured its operations in North America and Europe, it had been considering how it would attract more interest from the emerging markets, being particularly mindful of the growing number of businesses making their entry into Asia Pacific. It set its sights on the region, prioritising China, Japan and Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong, followed by India, ASEAN and Oceania.</p>
<p>But it was not just the mega-corporations that were reaching into the region. Smaller businesses from outside were keen to take advantage of the vibrancy of the commercial environment. Driven in part by a ‘customer-centric’ operational model, many were setting up shop closer to their clients or, if they were large companies, establishing regional treasury and shared services centres. Home-grown enterprises too were seeking a greater slice of the commercial action both domestically and overseas. By launching its ‘user-friendly’ corporate access programme in Asia Pacific, SWIFT was effectively “moving with the trend for customer-centricity”, notes Lee. With so many mid-sized businesses and regional banks located there, this was also a timely response to the criticism that it was an exclusive club for multinationals.</p>
<p>Whilst the level of uptake by corporates globally has now reached about 1,300, representing about 30,000 entities in total, the figure for Asia Pacific has edged past its first century-milestone and is currently heading towards 130. “With greater brand awareness and bank support we do believe this number will rapidly and exponentially rise,” states Lee.</p>
<h3 id="getting-connected">Getting connected</h3>
<p>Generating interest to fulfil this belief has seen Lee and the corporate sales team use a multi-pronged marketing approach that in the first instance exploits its obvious relationship with the banking community – bank referrals are important, she says. Naturally, SWIFT must call upon its own knowledge and understanding, working directly with industry bodies and financial communities in Asia Pacific, with the anticipation that, as the number of corporates increases, word-of-mouth will also play its part in driving growth. But SWIFT is keen to work closely with its industry partners such as application vendors and ASP partners, whether these are positioned globally, regionally or domestically; the latter two, notes Lee, are typically able to offer essential experience and knowledge of local market practices and conditions. Some of these markets – Japan, China and Korea in particular – have unique needs in legal and regulatory terms and local partners are in fact essential to facilitate SWIFT’s progress, she says.</p>
<p>An increasingly favoured SWIFT access route in Europe – particularly for smaller companies – is via a service bureau. It is worth noting here that of those corporates currently accessing the programme in Asia Pacific, few are using this route. “It can be used but it is generally less of a workable solution due to widely varying regulatory, compliance and technical requirements,” explains Lee. Although service bureaux are operating in jurisdictions such as Singapore and Hong Kong, the entry-model of choice across the region tends to be what she calls a “partnership total solution”. This means the major technology vendors – such as the ERP and TMS providers – offer a “connecting bridge” between SWIFT and the corporate’s own technology infrastructure. “A lot of vendors work very closely with us to extend their solutions; being able to penetrate this market provides them with a competitive edge. We just have to be conscious of the best business model to serve the customer base.”</p>
<p>Amongst the relevant technology firms, such as the SWIFT-certified vendors (those whose products reach a certain operational and functional standard as laid down by SWIFT), there are a few that are truly global (such a SAP and Oracle). Lee notes that a rising number of international application vendors, especially those with a strong presence in North America or Europe, are seeking closer alliance with SWIFT to facilitate their move further into Asia Pacific. Some local partners tend to focus on their own niche territories simply because the diversity of regulatory environments and customer-segment needs is generally too broad for these vendors to tackle, especially where complex markets such as Japan, China and Korea are concerned. “We have not seen one vendor that can meet the needs of the whole region,” she comments.</p>
<p>There is clearly a market opening for a local vendor capable of bridging that gap. In the meantime, in the interests of meeting local peculiarities, SWIFT is working with a small number of domestic vendors in each of these countries, encouraging a “proactive approach” to product development. SWIFT’s Asian market partnership model is not restricted to application vendors. Consultancy practices, including the ‘Big Four’ are very much included in the programme, working with SWIFT and providing recommendations to their customers.</p>

<p>The programme to raise brand awareness and sign new corporate members in Asia Pacific is precisely targeted; Lee confirming that China, Japan and Korea are indeed the strategic focus. As might be expected, Singapore and Hong Kong with their regional status as preferred sites for regional treasury centres are equally placed in that hierarchy. SWIFT is also eyeing Malaysia and the Philippines in light of the number of up-and-coming shared services centres here; these being promoted vigorously by their respective regulatory and central bank authorities. The current strategic focus, Lee insists, is not being implemented to the exclusion of the other countries in Asia Pacific. Indeed, as SWIFT’s operation in the region progresses the net will be cast ever-wider. It already has a sales presence in Australia, India, Japan, Korea, China, Hong Kong) and Singapore, whilst the other ASEAN countries are also now firmly on the SWIFT radar.</p>
<p>The total number of corporates on board today is within the realms of SWIFT’s expectation, states Lee. “There is a five-year plan which is reviewed annually. We are moving at a reasonable pace and year-on-year we are seeing around 50% growth in terms of corporate targets,” she adds. “Brand awareness is critical for SWIFT but is something that is lacking in the Asia Pacific region, even in the regional and domestic banking communities.”</p>
<h3 id="raising-awareness">Raising awareness</h3>
<p>The entire region presents as a “dynamic and exciting” market place, with diverse social and business cultures using multiple currencies and languages. SWIFT has been in Asia Pacific for more than 30 years and understands the need to raise brand awareness but the sheer diversity of the region is simultaneously a benefit and hindrance. For SWIFT’s awareness campaign, placing teams in each and every country is not feasible. However, by taking a more creative approach and using its partners to drive home the message, SWIFT is able to overcome such limitations.</p>
<p>For example, SWIFT works “proactively” with the banks and partners – using educational events, seminars, speaking opportunities and so on – to generate awareness amongst the relationship managers. Industry and trade associations are frequently co-opted to reach their members and help create greater awareness at both regional and country levels. “From there we will drive greater awareness amongst the customers,” states Lee. SWIFT also works to bring the financial community together, through various user groups and working groups, operating collaboratively to shape market practice, define standards and debate issues of mutual interest.</p>
<h3 id="the-right-products">The right products</h3>
<p>The SWIFT for corporates offering has grown in recent years, developing from its core messaging service to include a broad suite of corporate solutions covering payments, treasury, trade and supply chain. Lee notes that the Asia Pacific market is still developing at the emerging phase, “where corporates have started to see the importance and greater need for global cash visibility and management”. Therefore, many Asia Pacific corporates are actively looking for cash and treasury management solutions to achieve greater operational process efficiency, risk mitigation and cost efficiency. For some users, they are looking beyond cost and treasury management to other services such as eBAM, SWIFTRef, 3SKey and Accord.</p>
<p>“In Asia Pacific, adoption is not solely a top down process,” Lee adds. “It requires a lot of effort to reach out to the banking community and for the corporate decision makers to accept these products.”</p>
<h3 id="taking-advice">Taking advice</h3>
<p>“The strategic approach for us now is to focus on the core needs of customers,” says Lee. “We want to correct the perception held by some Asia Pacific corporates that SWIFT does not have products for businesses with basic requirements.” This is why SWIFT now has a variety of ‘on-boarding’ packages to more closely match corporate usage. The large corporate presence in multiple countries, working with multiple banks and accounts, will typically require a host-to-host service. “This is where our Alliance Access and Alliance Entry messaging interfaces come into the picture,” she says. Alliance Access is targeted at medium to high-volume users, whereas Alliance Entry is the version aimed at customers exchanging a maximum 1,000 files and messages a day; this may still prove too costly for some to justify. For customers with even less complex usage requirements, SWIFT offers the scaled back web-based Alliance Lite2 entry-level connectivity solution (Alliance Lite was introduced in 2008 and Lite2 arrived in 2012, claiming to further simplify on-boarding and reduce cost).</p>
<h3 id="getting-involved">Getting involved</h3>
<p>Within the SWIFT corporate family, some of the larger firms in the region are members of the Common Global Implementation initiative (CGI). This is a global collaboration between banks, corporates, vendors and payments institutions which, since 2009, have been seeking message harmonisation in the cash management sector. In Asia Pacific, Lee reports that its membership includes major corporates such as Huawei and China Railway Group Limited in China. It also has support from several global treasury centres in Singapore, including that of medical assistance organisation International SOS, and some of the larger regional corporates in ASEAN which are preparing treasury centres in their own countries and are primarily interested in the core cash management and treasury reporting services from SWIFT.</p>
<p>As an example of the latter, China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), the largest offshore oil and gas producer in China, was one of the first state-owned enterprises to introduce advanced cash and treasury management technology and processes, including multibank connectivity through SWIFT. “We are very pleased with the benefits we get from using SWIFT,” Huang Yi, Treasury Supervisor at CNOOC told Treasury Today. Now with a single, secure and standardised messaging platform he says the whole process is straight through, “bringing us greater efficiency while reducing costs and risks”. He sees CNOOC’s progress to date in this space as a “significant milestone as we continue to strengthen business operations in achieving our aggressive growth plans”.</p>
<p>Stemming from the desire to harmonise processes, and perhaps the key to progress for many users, is the adoption of ISO 20022 and MX standard for financial services messaging. As an alternative to the existing and more insular SWIFT FIN format, ISO 20022 (which has been adopted by many other financial services providers such as ISDA, FIX and Omgeo) uses the relatively simple XML format to encode documents. XML, being based on Unicode characters, allows it to express just about all of the world’s writing systems, meeting the needs of the global financial services industry and its customers.</p>
<p>“This is an initiative that both the banking and corporate communities should look into,” says Lee. “It facilitates operational efficiencies and eases process and integration costs.” That said, she feels uptake has faced “some challenges”, perhaps because of the general level of awareness of SWIFT services but also perhaps because of a general regional tendency not to be the first to adopt but instead to ‘wait and see’. “This is the consensus we are picking up on the ground so we need to share more information about the benefits of ISO 20022.”</p>
<h3 id="spreading-the-word">Spreading the word</h3>
<p>That SWIFT is now offering a number of services and products aimed directly at corporates of all sizes – but especially those that are multi-banked – is proof that it is trying to lower the barriers to entry and that its options for access are no longer weighted heavily in favour of the very large multinationals. The slow but steady level of uptake of SWIFT corporate services in Asia Pacific is more a symptom of the level of awareness than a lack of suitable products. As is the case across the globe, SWIFT membership is not appropriate for every business, but Lee is certain that if the level of understanding and knowledge is communicated at the right levels within the banks and the wider financial services industry, the interest of the corporate community is practically assured.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>The role of the treasurer is becoming increasingly complex and the tasks that treasury professionals perform on a daily basis are now far more sophisticated than ten, or even five, years ago. In turn, this evolving remit calls for technological innovation which will support treasurers to complete their day-to-day tasks, while simultaneously adding value to the wider business.</p>
<p>One such innovation is cloud computing. According to an informative presentation given during this workshop by Marcus Hughes, Director Business Development at Bottomline Technologies, cloud computing is now more important than ever. There are several significant drivers for this, he believes, such as the fact that many banks are reducing their cross-border lending, or deleveraging, and reducing their international networks as a result of Basel III, or in some cases, political pressure.</p>
<p>An unintended consequence of this banking ‘de-globalisation’ is that corporates will need even more banking partners to achieve global coverage, noted Hughes. This could exacerbate a longstanding problem for many corporates: too many smart cards and tokens for connecting with multiple banks, using different standards and different file formats. This situation could quickly become quite a headache to control and a major security risk, he said.</p>
<p>Little surprise then that more and more corporates are looking to use bank-agnostic SWIFT connectivity services – largely through the use of a SWIFT bureau. And as Hughes pointed out, SWIFT service bureaux were created originally to provide secure connectivity to SWIFT but now the best bureaux offer much than just connectivity: cloud-based applications for payment factories, SEPA DD mandate management, reconciliation, data transformation, compliance, cash forecasting, sweeping and pooling.</p>
<h3 id="regulatory-pressure">Regulatory pressure</h3>
<p>In addition to de-globalisation, banks are also becoming more selective about which companies they lend to and at what price – again as a result of Basel III. The types of deposit that banks will take is also coming under greater scrutiny since the new Liquidity Coverage and Net Stable Funding Ratios mean that retail deposits are more attractive than corporate deposits, unless they are operational balances as part of cash management services, or unless the deposits are committed to the banks for longer periods. This is precisely why, Hughes explained, efficient cash forecasting, sweeping and pooling arrangements are going to be even more valuable to avoid unnecessary overdrafts and optimise interest.</p>
<p>To meet these requirements, and the added burden of regulations such as the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), it is important for corporate treasurers to find a multi-channel platform which is adaptable, scalable, secure, resilient, proven and flexible. And increasingly, noted Hughes, these platforms are in the cloud, offering connectivity to multiple banks and multiple networks and a stack of software applications.</p>
<p>In short, with the arrival of cloud computing, corporates need to think not just about connectivity, but about ‘connectivity plus’ – in other words, accessing value add software applications, hosted in the cloud.</p>
<h3 id="cloud-computing-in-practice">Cloud computing in practice</h3>
<p>During the session, Hughes also provided a detailed case study on Scor, the French re-insurance group, a customer of Bottomline’s teams in France and Switzerland. The company was looking to migrate from ETEBAC to SEPA and was also tasked with a number of strategic decisions around multi-bank connectivity and security. It was looking for a smart solution to solve its multiple operational and strategic challenges in one – it approached Bottomline.</p>
<p>Today, Scor achieves secure and resilient connectivity with multiple banks and counterparties internationally by outsourcing to Bottomline’s SWIFT service bureau in Geneva, using GTExchange multi-network interface. Scor also uses SWIFT’s 3SKey to approve and authenticate outgoing messages. This is a single token to securely authenticate and approve transactions with multiple banks, using multiple channels, such as SWIFT and banks’ own e-banking platforms. 3SKey uses PKI and ensures a clear audit trail of who has approved a transaction. This, Hughes explained, is additional security on top of a SWIFT BIC which indicates which legal entity initiated a transaction.</p>
<p>In addition, Scor has automated data transformation of legacy formats into and from ISO 20022, to comply with SEPA and other message types using XML, which improves STP. For this, Scor uses BT’s GTFrame data transformation solution. Conducting all the data transformation on one platform means that Scor does not need to update its formats in different platforms; instead they simply update once for all their systems. Elsewhere, the company also uses Bottomline’s enterprise reconciliation solution GTMatch, which reconciles payments, bank statements, FX and MM transactions, as well as statements of securities holding.</p>
<p>The benefits of these solutions are wide and varied, but centre around cost reduction, risk mitigation and flexibility:</p>

<h3 id="technology-for-excellence">Technology for excellence</h3>
<p>Another company that has reaped significant benefits from an overhaul of its treasury technology is Valeo, one of the world’s leading automotive suppliers. The so-called TOTEM (Tools for Treasury Excellence in cash Management) project was led by Thierry Hamon, the company’s Treasury Controller. With more than 100 treasury staff and 600 signatories spread across 26 countries and four continents, 60 ERP systems, numerous payroll systems, and more than ten bank groups, the group’s connectivity challenges were manifold – and something had to change.</p>
<p>The graphic opposite illustrates the sheer scope of the project, and highlights how the challenges were overcome – primarily through the integration a software-as-a-service platform and the implementation of SWIFT connectivity.</p>
<p>As Hamon outlined, the all-in-one Saas platform offers the company a number of benefits, including: automatic forecasts after payments; integrated reporting statements and automatic controls over bank details. The core treasury team manages user access and profiles for the platform, meaning that they can be updated as and when necessary, with no delay.</p>
<p>In addition to the platform, the implementation of a centralised database with secure web access means that updates, disaster recovery planning and backups are no longer the treasury function’s responsibility. Also, multiple treasury staff can access the database simultaneously. And due to the cloud nature of the solution, payments validation is now both mobile and flexible.</p>
<p>Moreover, having a standard technology tool worldwide has led to better communication amongst treasurers and more reliable treasury reporting at Valeo. Benchmarking of best practices has also become far simpler with the new set-up, according to Hamon.</p>
<h3 id="lessons-learnt">Lessons learnt</h3>
<p>But, of course, garnering the benefits of the TOTEM project meant overcoming a number of hurdles along the way – and these provide interesting learning points for the wider treasury community. Take, for example, the fact that XML is not actually standardised. As Marie Laurence-Faure, Head of Marketing Product Channels at BNP Paribas explained during the connectivity workshop, despite XML being a standard in its own right, there are often small differences in fields and options at a national level and SEPA XML is a good example here. Certain banks may also use XML differently.</p>

</figure>
<p>To mitigate any such confusion or complications caused by potential XML inconsistencies, Hamon had consultants lead a workshop with all of his banking partners to get them on the same page. Other key lessons Hamon learned from the TOTEM project included the need to have: a single named point of contact at each bank, as well as one SWIFT SCORE contract by bank; a strong co-ordination plan to ensure all stakeholders are involved and on-board; and a rigorous testing programme with local experts to ensure all local specificities are covered and that the set-up works in all environments.</p>
<p>With a limited budget and timescale to implement TOTEM, Hamon also explained that success was ultimately dependent upon his team remaining focused solely on the defined scope of the project.</p>
<h3 id="security-is-paramount">Security is paramount</h3>
<p>Additional advice given by Hamon during the session centred largely around improving security in treasury systems. He suggested four key action points:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Control your data.</h5>
<p>This not only means protection through means of firewalls but the activation of automatic controls in the ERP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Secure your workflow.</h5>
<p>Segregation of duties will be vital here, as will internal controls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Connectivity.</h5>
<p>Use the robustness of the SWIFT network to improve reliability. Where possible, remove any unnecessary actors from the connectivity loop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Define service level agreements.</h5>
<p>This is particularly important for the TMS. Pinpoint where backups will be hosted. Outline expected levels of response time when problems arise. Ensure you have a 24/7 hotline number for all regions – and that the necessary languages are spoken by hotline staff.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Going forward, Hamon’s team will be investigating 3SKey as a means to further improve its security processes.</p>
<h3 id="the-future-of-connectivity">The future of connectivity</h3>
<p>According to BNP Paribas’ Faure, mobile technology will continue to gain traction in the corporate treasury field. And this will stretch beyond simple payments verification to wider cash management tasks, as well as treasury-related information. To illustrate this point, Faure explained that the new Cash Management Atlas app from BNP Paribas provides comprehensive cash management information on 48 countries globally. This includes information on permitted pooling techniques, payment and cash management instruments in use, clearing systems, the tax and regulatory environment, and local market practices.</p>
<p>Other connectivity innovations that will positively impact the treasury landscape in the near future include the ongoing development of additional bank-agnostic messaging systems, such as SAP’s financial services network (FSN). While the panel felt that the SAP’s FSN would not present a threat to SWIFT as such, the development of FSN was widely viewed as beneficial for corporates and banks alike.</p>
<p>Additional key connectivity trends identified by the panel included the outsourcing of activities to banks or vendors. Where companies recognise that they do not have the necessary expertise in-house, there is a growing move towards leveraging strategic business partnerships to provide specialist knowledge or services, said Faure. This might range from reconciliation services to data transformation. Citing an example here, Hughes noted that to overcome the issue of ‘local flavours’ of SEPA corporates can use solution providers, especially SWIFT service bureaux, to act as hubs connecting them with their banks and providing data transformation services to ensure STP.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, for Hughes, the emerging use of predictive analytics in improving the accuracy of cloud-based cash forecasting is another development to watch. He also drew attention to the adoption of payment sanction filtering by corporates. While banks retain ultimate regulatory responsibility for AML, he explained, corporates are starting to see the benefit of screening their payment instructions before submission to banks, thereby reducing the number of false positives that banks have to handle and minimising any reputational risk issues for their own entity.</p>
<p>Faure, on the other hand, highlighted reconciliations as a significant area of connectivity focus in the immediate future. The ultimate goal of straight through reconciliation, she said, will require deep, process-level, integration between corporate clients and their banks – but the continued move towards treasury centralisation should help to foster this. Virtual account solutions will also help to smooth the path towards automated reconciliation, helping to eliminate errors and reduce the need for manual intervention.</p>
<p>Finally, Hamon brought the session to a close with some simple yet powerful advice for his fellow treasurers: strive for continuous improvement. No matter how good your connectivity set-up is, he said, there will always be room for improvement – and that is what makes it so very interesting.</p>

<h5 id="jarno-timmerman">Jarno Timmerman, Head of Treasury South East Asia Pacific, AkzoNobel:</h5>
<p>Despite the technology to implement BAM and eBAM being readily available throughout Asia, the regulatory environment in many nations is a key factor hindering uptake. The regulators often still require you to produce physical paperwork and documentation which offsets many of the benefits that eBAM can offer, such as increased connectivity with banks and improved straight through processing (STP). Treasury departments in these countries will therefore be left with a two tier system – part completed through eBAM and part completed manually. The lack of efficiencies in this kind of solution make the integration cost harder to justify both in monetary and labour terms.</p>
<p>When implementing an eBAM solution, it is desirable for a treasury department to obtain 100% coverage over their bank accounts. This however is not possible in Asia due to the lack of support for eBAM solutions from regional banks. For example, many regional banks in Asia cannot support SWIFT connectivity and therefore if you have accounts with one or a number of these banks, only part of the standardisation and improved STP that eBAM brings will be achieved.</p>
<p>Treasury departments in Asia also often have greater priorities to deal with than eBAM. This, in part, explains its slower uptake in the region. For example, at AkzoNobel, we have previously prioritised the implementation of regional cash management structures and trade finance platforms over eBAM.</p>
<p>The implementation of eBAM is now on our agenda for 2014, however. A recent review of the company’s cash management mandates globally means that this is a good time to begin implementing the technology. The project is being led out of our headquarters in the Netherlands. The South East Asia Pacific hub, based in Singapore, will provide a supportive role to the overall project, ensuring that the requirements specific to Asia are captured in the scope of the project.</p>
<p>The mature regulatory environment in Singapore means that we can avoid many of the issues eBAM faces throughout Asia and once implemented it will allow us to capture data from our transaction banking infrastructure with increased accuracy, and increased efficiency.</p>
<p>Therefore, while implementation of BAM and eBAM is slow in many Asian countries due to the regulatory challenges it poses, I do believe that in less hostile regulatory environments such as Singapore it will become increasingly popular as treasury departments mature and their priorities change.</p>
<figure class="portrait left"><img alt="Portrait of Vairavan Ramanthan" height="150" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/2014/03/2014-03-tta-01-qa-vairavan-ramanthan-100x150.jpg" width="100"/></figure>
<h5 id="vairavan-ramanthan">Vairavan Ramanthan, Director, eCommerce and Channels, Asia Pacific, Bank of America Merrill Lynch:</h5>
<p>Rationalising bank accounts and bank relationships is a major focus for treasurers across the region. With this trend of rationalisation poised to become more common in Asia Pacific, the question will inevitably turn to the adoption of automated bank account management (BAM).</p>
<p>While the interest is clearly there in Asia Pacific, there remains a diverse range of challenges hindering widespread adoption of BAM and electronic bank account management (eBAM). Currently, automated BAM is considered by treasurers as a value-add rather than a must-have. Significantly, 78% of respondents to our research have said they don’t plan to implement automated BAM solutions.</p>
<p>There are reasons driving this behaviour. Firstly there is a lack of awareness within corporate treasury of the benefits of an automated BAM solution. The services and solutions provided by banks in this space are also holding back adoption. Ultimately, this lack of awareness makes internal account management teams resist a move to an automated BAM solution.</p>
<p>On the eBAM front, slower than expected adoption is largely a regulatory-based issue. Given the diversity of Asia Pacific and gaps in market sophistication, it should not come as a surprise that only three markets are fully ready for eBAM – Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore.</p>
<p>Regulations aside, widespread support of eBAM from regional and local banks is lukewarm at best, with global banks championing eBAM adoption. One of the major roadblocks is that corporate clients need to have two different processes – electronic interfaces with banks that support eBAM and manual interfaces with banks that do not support eBAM. This dichotomy makes it difficult to realise the full benefits of automated process using eBAM.</p>
<p>In our opinion, for eBAM to work, there has to be a widespread adoption of digital signatures, which is currently lacking due to the legal framework not favouring digital signature over wet signatures. Only Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore have passed legislation to support digital signatures.</p>
<p>In addition, many countries require an original or certified true copy which therefore makes the corporate duplicate the process by having to send electronic versions followed by physical copies. The promised automation of eBAM is not achieved in this case and the objective of digitalising the account management processes is lost.</p>
<p>There are other major considerations. For instance, adoption of multi-bank digital security and digital identification infrastructures like SWIFT 3Skey are not currently widespread. Furthermore, the integration of eBAM or BAM solutions to back office systems like Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Treasury Management Systems (TMS) and Human Resources systems (HR) is still a hurdle and the cost of integration is high.</p>
<p>For BAM and eBAM adoption to become more popular in Asia Pacific, awareness has to be created through customer education and broader support from in-country regulatory bodies. Corporates can start with the adoption of BAM by establishing a central data repository which supports account information, signer details, mandates and contracts. This will ensure a smoother migration to eBAM once the legal framework matures in Asia Pacific. Corporates, banks, SWIFT, technology vendors and consulting firms all have a part to play throughout this process.</p>
<figure class="portrait left"><img alt="Portrait of Dan Gill" height="150" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/2014/03/2014-03-tta-01-qa-dan-gill-100x150.jpg" width="100"/></figure>
<h5 id="dan-gill">Dan Gill, Senior Vice President, Weiland Corporate Solutions, Fiserv:</h5>
<p>One of the major factors hindering greater use of BAM and eBAM in Asia is the slow uptake in the United States and Western Europe. BAM and eBAM are only just starting to make significant progress in these developed markets, where only a few steps need to be taken for corporates to implement the technology. Therefore in Asia, where it is often significantly harder to implement, the market is monitoring the progress of BAM and eBAM before taking any substantial steps. I predict once BAM and eBAM is widely used in the United States and Western Europe it will become increasingly popular in Asia as MNCs push the technology on their subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Regulatory issues are also proving a major stumbling block for the growth of BAM and eBAM in Asia. The strict rules surrounding banking in the region make it very difficult for a corporate to use eBAM. For example, it is sometimes the case that you need a physical presence at the bank to open or close an account and this is something that cannot be digitised. The uptake of eBAM in many Asian countries will depend on the evolution of the regulatory environment over time, to a point of being comfortable with electronic delivery of information.</p>
<p>Currently BAM and eBAM are primarily seen as efficiency tools. However the main benefit, for eBAM especially, derives from its ability to improve a company’s controlling and audit processes. Matching a company’s records to the bank’s records is presently a challenge in all geographies. eBAM allows a company to accurately match and manage its bank account records, improving this process. Once the auditors begin to see this high level of accuracy consistently from companies who use eBAM it will become the de facto standard. Therefore if you are not communicating through eBAM it will be seen as a deficiency by the auditors and you will be penalised. Once this begins to happen, BAM and eBAM become more than efficiency tools and will become a must for treasury departments in Asia and worldwide.</p>
<p>The software that is required to utilise BAM and eBAM is already widely available in the Asia Pacific region and the global banks are attempting to drive the project forward. However, regional banks in the region are yet to put their weight behind BAM and eBAM and that will be required for it to fully take off. These banks will ultimately respond to demand, so corporates in the region who have an interest in using these technologies need to start putting pressure on their regional banks to support them.</p>
<p>In five years’ time, I see BAM and eBAM becoming increasingly popular in Asia. Many major US and Western European companies will be using BAM and eBAM which will subsequently drive this further into the Asia Pacific region. In turn, this should trigger the banks to support the technology and help towards a maturing of the regulatory environment.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Over the last five years, the focus on counterparty risk within corporate treasury departments has increased substantially. Before the global financial crisis, most banks, in particular the bigger institutions, were considered to be relatively low risk counterparties. But as markets began to rapidly deteriorate towards the end of 2008, treasurers were suddenly confronted with a scenario which they never imagined possible just a few months before. Namely, that one or more of the major banks could fail and that deposits held with those institutions might not be fully repaid.</p>
<p>In the wake of the crisis, many treasury professionals had to reassess a number of their old assumptions about how best to measure and manage their company’s exposure to counterparties. This was especially true, with regard to the role of credit ratings. Today, counterparty risk has become one of the most significant issues facing corporate treasurers. It is a reality which is frequently reflected in survey data. In the 2012 Asia Pacific Corporate Treasury Benchmarking Study conducted by Treasury Today, in association with J.P. Morgan, 51% of the corporate treasurers who participated said that they were more focused on counterparty risk than they were 12 months ago, with only 6% of respondents reporting a decline.</p>
<p>The proportion of respondents in the European version of the Study who stated that counterparty risk had increased for their company over the past 12 months was even higher. In what is perhaps a reflection of heightened levels of risk resulting from the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in the Eurozone, 62% of respondents stated they believed counterparty risk had increased over the previous 12 months. And with 15 major banks – including Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, and RBS – hit with downgrades by the ratings agency Moody’s in June 2012, it seems probable that counterparty risk will remain high on the corporate treasurer’s agenda for some time to come. But let’s take a closer look at other sources of counterparty risk, as well as ways to measure and mitigate exposures.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-counterparty-risk">What is counterparty risk?</h3>
<p>Counterparty or ‘credit default risk’ can be defined simply as the risk that someone you do business with – be it a corporation, bank, or government – will be unable to meet their payment obligations to you. For example, if a bank gets into severe difficulties there is a risk that the bank may not be able to repay deposits made by its corporate clients.</p>
<p>In basic terms, the higher the odds of a default are, the higher the level of counterparty risk. It is important to note however that it is not only the actual chance of a default that counts – but also the level of risk perceived in the markets. If a bank, corporation or even a sovereign nation faces a downgrade in their credit worthiness, then everything from market value to liquidity status could potentially be affected.</p>
<p>However, before a treasurer can act to mitigate counterparty risk, he or she must first be able to identify the different sources of risk facing the organisation. The table opposite provides a good starting point.</p>
<h3 id="why-credit-ratings-alone-are-no-longer-sufficient">Why credit ratings alone are no longer sufficient</h3>
<p>Pre 2007/8, most corporate treasurers considered credit ratings alone to be adequate for the purpose of measuring the level of their counterparty exposures. But this was to change irrevocably when the financial crisis shook global markets in 2008. The turning point came with the fall of Lehman Brothers, whose credit rating at the time placed it safely within the accepted ‘investment grade’ band. The investment bank’s collapse was to have profound implications for the way corporate treasuries measure and manage counterparty risk – in particular with respect to the ratings agencies.</p>
<p>“The ratings agencies were heavily criticised when the world economy collapsed,” says Dmitry Pugachevsky, Director of Research at Quantifi, a leading provider of risk management software for the global OTC markets. “At the time, some argued that they did not follow closely enough what was happening during the crisis, that counterparty risk management in financial companies and other types of company was changing and the agencies were maybe lagging behind. Risk was not being truly reflected in the ratings.” But if ratings agencies are no longer a sufficient measure of counterparty risk alone, then what are the available alternatives?</p>
<p>The solution adopted by many corporates was not to focus on any one specific method, but a range of different indicators. Most treasurers still view credit ratings as an important measure of counterparty risk. For instance, according to Treasury Today’s 2012 Asia Pacific Benchmarking Study, 81% of respondents cited ratings agencies as their main method for measuring their exposure to counterparties. Once again, in the 2012 European Corporate Treasury Benchmarking Study, the figure was even higher – the ratings agencies reports were the most popular tool used to measure counterparty risk (amongst 89% of respondents).</p>
<p>But a number of additional checks are also being employed by corporates – ranging from CDS spread monitoring to the analysis of equity market data. According to Pugachevsky, CDS spread monitoring has proved to be a particularly useful method for measuring counterparty exposure. He believes that one of the principal reasons for this is their ability to provide up-to-the-minute data on the markets – something which could make all the difference when a crisis strikes.</p>
<p>“You can criticise CDS markets for being slightly speculative, or even seriously speculative – but with credit default swaps you do get a more up-to-date picture of what is going on in markets. You definitely see daily moves – so when there is a negative outlook or some negative views on a bank or company then CDS markets react immediately. So CDS markets – as well as equities and bonds – would definitely be part of the bigger picture treasurers should be looking at when measuring counterparty risk,” he says.</p>
<p>In most cases however, the correct method for measuring and managing counterparty risk really depends on the particular type of exposure a corporation is facing. Below we describe in more detail some of the appropriate responses to the major forms of counterparty exposure.</p>
<h3 id="deposits-and-investments">Deposits and investments</h3>
<p>The key to effectively managing the counterparty risks associated with deposits and investments is cash visibility. An accurate, up-to-date understanding of each of the institutions the corporation banks with is of crucial importance if a corporate is to correctly measure their level of market exposure. To accomplish this, some corporates remain committed to using traditional methods, such as spread sheets, while others have moved to install specialist software that offers real-time updates and ongoing monitoring and analysis of all the corporation’s counterparty exposures.</p>
<p>Diversification is the most effective way to protect deposits and investments from counterparty risk. Both should be spread out and held in multiple banks and institutions, geographical areas, and asset classes to minimise the likelihood of a loss of capital in a crisis.</p>
<h3 id="borrowing">Borrowing</h3>
<p>The credit crisis again highlighted the importance of keeping a close check on the institutions you borrow money from. In particular, corporates should look out for circumstances that could lead to institutions they use altering their lending policies. While there is no risk to current agreements, banks which offer revolving credit facilities may well, in crisis conditions, choose to increase the price of such a facility or even not to renew it.</p>
<h3 id="foreign-exchange">Foreign exchange</h3>
<p>The main concern for corporates when undertaking foreign exchange transactions is settlement risk. This risk is sometimes referred to by the name Herstatt after the German bank which failed during the 1970s leaving a number of unsettled FX payments to its various counterparties. It occurs when a payment to an overseas partner is sent but no corresponding funds are received in return.</p>
<p>The best way to eliminate this form of risk is through a service called Continuous Linked Settlement. CLS uses a third-party intermediary to settle FX trades instantly, paying out in the respective currencies when each party confirms that they have the funds to proceed with the transaction. Then, should one of the parties fail to meet the terms of the deal, the amounts originally paid out would then be returned to the relevant parties.</p>

<h3 id="derivatives">Derivatives</h3>
<p>Counterparty risk presents a serious problem for corporates conducting derivatives transactions. It is of vital importance when conducting such deals that the counterparty with whom the agreement has been made is able to fulfil their side of the contract. Take interest rate swaps, for instance. Should two parties undertake a fixed for floating interest rate swap, each party remains responsible for making the original interest payments – meaning that if counterparty fails, you will remain liable to pay the original interest payment. To mitigate such risk a corporate needs to monitor all its derivative positions carefully and regularly carry out internal audits to prevent or detect systematic or fraudulent abuse of positions.</p>
<h3 id="accounts-receivable">Accounts receivable</h3>
<p>Accounts receivable, or in other words money that is owed to a company by its clients, is an unequivocal example of counterparty risk. If a company extends credit to its clients there is always some chance that they will not receive payment on time, or possibly not receive any payment at all, should the client end up defaulting on the debt.</p>
<p>Either way, the end result is inevitably that actual cash flow will not match predicted cash flow – a scenario which left unchecked could potentially become a source of liquidity problems for the corporate. All customers therefore should be checked thoroughly in advance to any extension credit to identify those who pose an excessively high credit risk. Such careful checks should continue to be carried out to existing debtors – paying particular attention to changes in payment behaviour which could possibly indicate that they are experiencing financial difficulties.</p>
<h3 id="trade-financing-and-leasing">Trade financing and leasing</h3>
<p>Although trade financing can be used by a corporation as a means of mitigating counterparty risk, it does not eliminate all the risk from a trade. Common risk management procedure for trade financing would involve assessing both the creditworthiness of the organisation providing the trade finance and the legal counterparty in the leasing agreement.</p>
<p>It is important to be aware of the level of regulation existing to provide you protection in instances of default. Some trade finance providers and leasing companies belong to international banking groups, while others do not. It is therefore essential to carefully assess the balance sheets of any trade finance provider prior to conducting any business with them.</p>
<h3 id="supplier-risk">Supplier risk</h3>
<p>Supplier risk is an important, yet sometimes neglected facet of counterparty risk management. Disruption to the supply chain can have severe consequences, as the recent financial crisis illustrated. When suppliers began to go out of business during the credit crisis, many of their clients soon followed, unable to stay solvent without the necessary materials or funding to continue operating. In order to effectively manage supplier risk a corporate should examine each level of its supply chain and identify at each stage the appropriate action to be taken should the risk posed become a reality. It may be useful to draw up a supplier risk intelligence checklist, as outlined in the July/August 2012 edition of Treasury Today. </p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>With the bank lending squeeze continuing to bite, corporate securitisation offers companies an attractive funding alternative. Businesses stand to gain lower financing costs, increased levels of liquidity, a broader funding base and reduced dependency on banks.</p>
<p>In a tight credit environment, treasurers are forced to become more inventive when it comes to meeting the funding requirements of their business. Corporate securitisation can be an important step towards closing the liquidity gap for companies – and it is seen as a viable source of financing for corporates with accounts receivables of $50m or above. But what is corporate securitisation? Which company assets can be securitised? And what are the benefits that can be gained?</p>
<p>Corporate securitisation is the process of pooling selected assets from the company’s balance sheet and transforming them into tradable, interest-bearing securities for capital market investors. In 2011, European securitisation issuance was €372 billion, according to a recent report by the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) – a mere fraction of the €1,014 billion issued in the United States during the same year. However these figures fall far below the heights reached in 2007. The global financial crisis dealt the securitisation industry a heavy blow from which is has yet to recover.</p>
<p>“After the crisis, the market has gone back to basics,” says Rick Watson, Head of Capital Markets at AFME. “In both Europe and the United States, the predominant asset classes are the simplest, with proven track records such as residential mortgage-backed securities, auto loans, cards and leasing.”</p>
<h3 id="nuts-and-bolts">Nuts and bolts</h3>
<p>There are two steps to consider in the securitisation process for a corporate. The first begins when a company wishes to raise finance. Let’s take the example of a paint manufacturer. The paint manufacturer, known as the originator in this case, removes selected assets from its balance sheet and then pools them to form what is called a ‘reference portfolio’. For corporates the assets in question are often accounts receivables – but, technically speaking, any assets that generate a steady flow of cash can be securitised. Other examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Credit card receivables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auto loans and leases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mortgages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equipment loans and leases.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The pool of assets is then sold on to an issuer, which is usually a large bank. The transformation also legally separates the selected assets. This isolates them from any potential bankruptcy of the originator. By selling its asset pool, our paint manufacturer receives payment for the assets in one lump sum, rather than spread out over time. This payment can be put towards alleviating any cash flow difficulties or liquidity troubles the originator may have. The issuer often sets up a special purpose vehicle (SPV), specially created to take on the assets.</p>
<h3 id="an-acronym-to-remember">An acronym to remember</h3>
<p>To many people, the acronym ‘SPV’ is just one of several introduced to the world by the financial crisis. But an important idea lies behind the three letters. An SPV is a legal entity set up by a financial institution – usually a bank – to carry out a particular activity, often the securitisation of asset pools.</p>
<p>The SPV is not a normal business operation. It has no employees. Nor does it have a physical location. Indeed, it is structured in such a way that it cannot become bankrupt. It is perhaps taking these factors into account, that the National Bureau of Economic Research in America dubbed SPVs ‘robot firms’ in a 2007 report.</p>
<p>The administrative function of an SPV is performed by a trustee who follows strict rules when it comes to receiving and distributing cash flows. The typical legal form of an SPV is a limited partnership or limited liability company. Prior to the crisis, SPVs were popular because they allowed issuers to benefit from a lower cost of capital.</p>
<p>SPVs have undergone increasing scrutiny in the last decade. For instance the energy firm Enron used 3,000 SPVs to keep its off-balance sheet debt hidden from the eyes of prying investors. A subsequent financial scandal brought down the company. SPVs also played a role in the downfall of the investment bank Lehman Brothers in 2008. Both companies are now in the dustbin of history. But it is likely that SPVs will continue to play a significant role in the future world of business.</p>
<p>The second step of the securitisation process is more nuanced. In order to finance the acquisition of the asset pool, the SPV issues tradable, interest-bearing securities to capital market investors. These securities, known as asset-backed securities (ABS), allow investors to lay claim on the cash flows backed by the asset pool (the trade receivables of our paint manufacturer).</p>
<p>In many cases the originator still collects the cash flows and passes them on to the SPV or investors, via a trust fund and minus a servicing fee. These two steps describe what is called the ‘originate-and-distribute’ approach.</p>
<p>No two investors are the same. Indeed, many investors have different levels of risk tolerance. As a result, issuers slice up the asset pool and tailor securities so that they have specific levels of risk attached. These slices are known as ‘tranches’. The idea was to make securitisation appealing both to cautious pension fund managers and risk-loving traders. Securitisation structures often take the form of a three-tiered cake: tranches range from junior, mezzanine and senior levels.</p>
<p>By using various forms of credit support, issuers can create securities with different levels of seniority. The three-tiered structure concentrates expected losses in the junior tranche, which absorbs the initial losses until it is depleted, followed by the mezzanine tier, which is in turn followed by the senior tranche.</p>
<p>To help investors decide the creditworthiness of ABSs, credit rating agencies – such as Standard &amp; Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch – offer individual ratings for each tranche, from AAA downwards. Taking all these factors into consideration, securitised instruments can be generally defined by the following three characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The pooling of assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The decoupling of the credit risk of the collateral asset pool from that of the originator. This occurs by means of the transfer of the underlying assets to an issuer’s SPV.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tranching of liabilities, with different levels of seniority and risk exposure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="did-you-know">Did you know?</h3>
<p>In the popular press, securitisation is often caricatured as a manifestation of financial capitalism gone wrong. More often than not, it is presumed that ‘greedy financers’ invented securitisation as a simple means to make more money. But securitisation was actually a public sector innovation. In 1970 the Government National Mortgage Association, an American government agency dubbed ‘Ginnie Mae’, invented mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) for investors.</p>
<p>Before, market participants had to contend with trading whole loans or unsecuritised mortgages in a generally illiquid market. Securitisation had a tremendous impact, facilitating the transfer of capital from those who had it, to those who needed it. Ginnie Mae succeeded in introducing more liquidity into the market. Other government agencies, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, soon followed suit. The corporate world took note. By the 1980s, other income-producing assets had begun to be securitised, and since then the securitisation industry has experienced extraordinary growth. Who knew that such a useful public sector innovation would come to haunt the American economy nearly four decades later?</p>
<h3 id="securing-the-benefits">Securing the benefits</h3>
<p>So much for the securitisation process. What advantages does it offer? Companies stand to gain a number of benefits from corporate securitisation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Lower financing costs</h5>
<p>Securitised assets benefit from a lower risk profile. This is because receivables typically have a higher credit quality than the originator itself. They are also legally separated from any potential bankruptcy of the company. The end result is lower interest costs. Without securitisation, the business would finance itself through borrowing based on its own creditworthiness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Corporate balance sheet benefits</h5>
<p>Since the reference portfolio is legally removed from the company’s balance sheet, the corporates gearing (ie, debt-equity ratio) is reduced, all other things being equal. The business can then better comply with its financial covenants with regard to on-balance sheet borrowing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Increased levels of liquidity</h5>
<p>Instead of receiving payments spread out over time, corporates gain from receiving a lump sum immediately, thereby alleviating any cash flow difficulties. Business can receive cash for their accounts receivables within days of the invoice being issued. This allows the company to increase its financial flexibility in uncertain economic times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>A more diversified capital structure</h5>
<p>As financial institutions continue to deleverage, bank lending will remain difficult to obtain. Corporates are often beholden to the decisions of their banking counterparties, particularly in the aftermath of the credit crunch. Trade receivables securitisation adds some leeway in this problem and can help corporates reduce their dependency on banks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Corporate securitisation is often used as part of a wider financing plan. In 2009, for example, Honeywell International tapped the trade accounts receivable market as part of its corporate debt solution – a strategy that went on to win a ‘Highly Commended Award’ at Treasury Today’s Adam Smith Awards 2010. More recently, in response to a challenging year, the American tobacco manufacturer Alliance One doubled its trade receivables securitisation facility to $250m in May 2012 to boost its working capital at hand.</p>
<p>But not just any corporate can start securitising its trade receivables. There are a few factors to consider. First, size does matter. Companies considering securitisation usually have receivables of $50m or above. Second, they should have strong administrative systems and robust credit and collection practices. These can go a long way in ensuring a smooth securitisation process. And third, some industries are more favourable to securitisation than others – manufacturing and distributors often find it easier than most to securitise.</p>
<p>And there is another important factor to consider. Regulatory changes, such as Solvency II, will make it more costly for European insurers and pension funds to hold securitised products, among other assets, on their balance sheets. Moreover, capital rules are changing, with Basel III making it more expensive to lend. Corporates can expect demand for securitised assets to dampen in the near future.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, corporate securitisation plays a vital role in the funding landscape. Since the credit crunch ended, “Securitisation has provided over €103 billion in funding for SME loans, as well as a significant source of funding for consumer auto loans and leases, dealer floor plan loans and commercial mortgages,” says Watson at AFME.</p>
<p>Regardless of regulatory changes, corporate securitisation remains an attractive option for many businesses. The current lending squeeze means that the cost of credit is increasing. Corporate securitisation helps facilitate the flow of capital from those who have it, capital investors, to those who need it – the company. </p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Once an out-of-reach ideal, access to SWIFT is becoming easier and more affordable for corporates across the globe. Offering treasurers a single, standardised, and secure messaging interface with their banking partners, SWIFT Corporate Access is recognised as a key tool in enabling effective treasury management today. With the commonly perceived barriers to adoption quickly dropping away, isn’t it time your company thought again about SWIFT Corporate Access?</p>
<p>Managing bank communication channels and co-ordinating bank accounts on a global basis is a challenging task. The cost of maintaining multiple bank interfaces is high and the complexity of managing numerous user IDs and passwords is time consuming and frustrating. Above all, the inability to view cash positions across a global bank network often leads to internal inefficiencies, including idle ‘pockets’ of cash.</p>
<figure class="portrait left">
<img alt="Portrait of Mike Burn" height="150" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/2011/11and12/2011-11and12-tt-07-pp-mike-burn-2011-jpm-100x150.jpg" width="100"/>

<p>SWIFT Corporate Access is designed to address these pain points, helping corporates to achieve increased visibility over their global cash position. The driver behind this is the centralisation of account information – a goal that, for many treasurers – has been superseded by crisis-related risk monitoring.</p>
<p>Mike Burn, ACCESS℠ Product Executive, Treasury Services, EMEA, J.P. Morgan (pictured left), recognises that corporates have higher priorities today than SWIFT as a stand-alone project, but believes that SWIFT Corporate Access plays a key role in achieving overall business efficiencies. “Naturally, there are a number of priorities on the treasurer’s agenda today: FX risk management, investment security and counterparty exposures, to name but a few. As such, SWIFT may seem to be yet another item on the ‘to-do’ list for many treasurers, but in fact, as part of an ‘umbrella’ project, such as centralisation or a payments factory, it could be an essential tool in helping to address those more immediate priorities and indeed in future-proofing the treasury function.”</p>
<h3 id="reasons-to-take-another-look">Reasons to take another look</h3>
<p>The benefits of SWIFT Corporate Access stretch beyond cash visibility and a reduction in the costs and complexity of dealing with multiple bank connections, however. For example, the high level of consistency in corporate-to-bank communications that SWIFT provides makes it possible to increase transparency around critical operations – such as treasury settlement, accounts payable, accounts receivable as well as other payment and collection operations, trade finance, securities and custody operations, and foreign exchange confirmations.</p>
<p>Moreover, additional potential benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Increased geographic reach to your financial operations.</h5>
<p>As long as the chosen bank is SWIFT-ready, communications can be made between a corporate and a bank in any location. This increases both the choice of provider in a given location and of course allows for increased visibility over cash on a worldwide basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Improved audit compliance.</h5>
<p>SWIFT Corporate Access supports compliance requirements with relevant regulations and principles of good practice, such as the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the UK Corporate Governance Code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Improved STP and processing capacities.</h5>
<p>SWIFT not only allows for the enhancement of straight through processing (STP) but also offers the related efficiencies of using standards to communicate across your bank network, including near-real-time updates of cash balances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Security and resilience, integral to the SWIFT network.</h5>
<p>SWIFT boasts a 99.999% availability record. As a system that is used by the world’s banks and many payment systems, SWIFT is a trusted means of communicating payment instructions and other sensitive data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Support for the non-repudiation of payments.</h5>
<p>This gives peace of mind to both parties: in the case of a dispute, SWIFT is able to confirm that a message exchange did take place as claimed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Given these benefits, why is the adoption level of SWIFT Corporate Access still relatively low – having just hit the 900 user threshold? According to Burn, it has a great deal to do with perception. “Expense is overwhelmingly the most significant, or frequently cited reason for not pursuing SWIFT Corporate Access. Although the service has its associated costs, SWIFT has worked hard to make the offering more affordable.” Testament to SWIFT’s on-going pricing restructure is the fact that SWIFT Corporate Access is no longer the domain of only the largest MNCs – mid-market treasuries are now taking advantage of it too.</p>
<p>“When corporates are able to find the time and resources to do a detailed analysis on the benefits that SWIFT could bring, it often turns out to be cheaper than anticipated and easier to implement,” adds Burn. “J.P. Morgan Treasury Services has worked with numerous clients to assist them with these calculations and SWIFT was frequently the most economical route.”</p>
<p>So, with the traditional barriers being lowered, is SWIFT Corporate Access right for your company, what are the available connectivity options and how should implementation be approached?</p>
<h3 id="best-practice-makes-perfect">Best practice makes perfect</h3>
<p>When considering SWIFT Corporate Access, companies looking to adhere to best practice should examine the full project lifecycle, according to Stew Cofer, SWIFT Product Manager, Treasury Services, EMEA, J.P. Morgan. The three main phases are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>

<p>“Planning and preparation is often the phase that gets the least focus but really needs the most,” says Cofer. While corporates can do much of the planning and assessment in-house, or speak to other treasurers who have implemented SWIFT, assistance from bank partners can help to fully realise the advantages of SWIFT Corporate Access. Banks will be able to assist by identifying the types of services and messages that they support via the SWIFT network. Remember that not all banks are reachable by SWIFT, or do not support the SWIFT Corporate Access model. However, the SWIFT Bank Readiness Certification programme should help corporates in determining the suitability of their banking partners for the project.</p>

<p>J.P. Morgan achieved its Bank Readiness Certification at the inception of the programme in February 2011 and has been a strong supporter of SWIFT Corporate Access since its inception. “By working with J.P. Morgan,” says Burn, “our clients can draw on the bank’s extensive experience in this area. Although no two SWIFT implementations are the same, there are definite lessons to be learnt and we have picked up a number of tips and hints for corporates along the way.” Many customers are leveraging J.P. Morgan’s industry experience with ISO 20022 in combination with SWIFT, allowing them to utilise the same formats and methods across their global bank network, reducing technology expense and streamlining their operational processes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, J.P. Morgan can facilitate communications with a corporate’s banks that are SWIFT members but do not participate in SWIFT Corporate Access, thereby allowing a corporate to further leverage its investment.</p>
<h3 id="building-a-solid-business-case">Building a solid business case</h3>
<p>Having a realistic business case to present to the Board that includes capital requirements and expected return on investment can be ‘make or break’ for a SWIFT implementation. By gathering as much data as possible up front, you will be better positioned to build a solid proposal.</p>
<p>The main points to consider around capital requirements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>SWIFT costs, for registration, connectivity and messaging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Financial institution costs for transactions and reporting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-SWIFT costs for project management, operations and application integration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While the number-crunching may require some assistance from your banks, one of the harder stages to building a business case is quantifying the less tangible benefits. These include risk management, security, fewer manual errors and improved control. In fact, these may be key drivers behind the ‘umbrella’ project which SWIFT forms a part of. Providing an accurate indication of the financial benefits, from improved working capital for example, can also be challenging. According to data from SWIFT, however, corporates that have joined have typically received between 200% and 300% return on investment.</p>
<p>Burn and Cofer recommend that the following considerations are also taken into account when building the business case:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>The cost of internal processes.</h5>
<p>Build a model for work-hours spent and costs associated with gathering and incorporating banking data. In addition, remember to quantify security credential management, as each bank will have its own requirements. Furthermore, by adopting standardised SWIFT formats across multiple banking institutions, you will be able to eliminate the rekeying of payments for your various banks, which will reduce labour costs and reduce margin for error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Conduct an inventory of your banks and accounts.</h5>
<p>Assess the amount of actively managed cash and the value and volumes of accounts that are not actively managed. This assessment will enable you to develop a global financial positioning model. Once you have visibility into all your accounts, you will need to determine whether it will be necessary to pool all of your transactions for a comprehensive view.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Understand your total cost-of-ownership for your banking infrastructure.</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Assess current technology and any necessary changes.</h5>
<p>Evaluate your core systems, such as treasury, accounting, and your ERP applications and assess any requirements for integration with key banking communications applications (eg cash accounts, payables). Speak with your ERP or workstation provider(s) to see if they are SWIFT capable. If so, find out what formats they support (MT and XML) across the various business processes that you intend to deploy through SWIFT.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="technical-connectivity">Technical connectivity</h3>
<p>How a corporate connects to SWIFT is invisible to their counterparties, but there are financial and operational considerations affiliated with each method:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Direct access</h5>
<p>The technical infrastructure is located at the corporate’s offices, requiring up front investment and on-site technical support and expertise for on-going management and maintenance of the connection. This option is ideal when the corporate has specific security requirements, or requires a high volume infrastructure, for example. However, corporates should be aware that this is not a ‘plug and play’ solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Alliance Lite</h5>
<p>This is an ‘off the shelf’ outsourced solution for customers with low volume requirements. This browser-based solution is often used as an entry into SWIFT, or to build a test case for an eventual move to a direct SWIFT connection or the utilisation of a service bureau.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Service bureau (indirect access)</h5>
<p>The technical infrastructure is hosted and maintained by a third party, providing specialist knowledge, full disaster recovery and value added features such as the conversion of messages to SWIFT format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Member/concentrator (indirect access)</h5>
<p>The infrastructure is hosted and maintained by a third party offering the same benefits as the service bureau model. However, the member/concentrator has to be a SWIFT member and they offer a broader remit of services, including administration of the SWIFT contract such as registration and receiving SWIFT invoices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, deciding whether or not to connect to SWIFT and/or the best connectivity solution to use will depend on a corporate’s own set of circumstances and business requirements. Size, global locations, the number of banking relationships, transaction types and volumes, existing systems, the current structure in treasury and strategic plans will all impact on the ultimate decision.</p>
<div class="boxed">
<h4 id="administering-your-swift-membership">Administering your SWIFT membership</h4>
<p>There are two different SWIFT membership options for corporates, but they are not mutually exclusive. They affect which message types you can exchange and with whom you can exchange them. Either SWIFT or your bank representative can advise further on which is right for you.</p>
<h4 id="score">SCORE</h4>
<p>Since 2007, the Standardised Corporate Environment (SCORE) has been the main model for corporate participation in SWIFT. It is a one-to-many open model, meaning that corporates that join this group can send/receive with any of banks that have joined it. SCORE is widely perceived as the ‘default’ option for corporates joining SWIFT.</p>
<p>Any privately or publicly held corporate can join SCORE. If you are not a listed company, a SCORE bank can sponsor you into SCORE by recommendation/sponsorship.</p>
<h4 id="ma-cug">MA-CUG</h4>
<p>The Member Administered Closed User Group (MA-CUG) was the first model through which corporates were able to exchange a broad range of treasury and cash management messages via the SWIFT network. Set up in 2001, it opened up SWIFT to corporates through a bank sponsorship structure. It is a one-to-one model where the messages and/or formats that will be exchanged are agreed on between the corporate and the bank. Corporates can join multiple MA-CUGs, should they so wish.</p>
<p>This model is most suited for use as a complement to SCORE in those cases where a message is not permissible over SCORE.</p>
</div>

<p>“Corporates will also need to consider whether they want to own or rent their technology; to understand the trade-off between fixed investment costs and variable operating costs; and to determine how much in-house IT capability is available for the treasury function.”</p>

<p>“Corporates will also need to consider whether they want to own or rent their technology; to understand the trade-off between fixed investment costs and variable operating costs; and to determine how much in-house IT capability is available for the treasury function. As such, Alliance Lite, for example, may be preferable for some clients over a full, direct connection,” says Burn.</p>
<p>“J.P. Morgan also has proprietary technology available, including J.P. Morgan ACCESS℠, an internet-based workstation delivering integrated access to information reporting, investment and transaction services, for example, as well as inquiries in real-time. Our online e-banking, files channel and SWIFT capabilities complement one another to maximise their value,” adds Cofer. Through these proprietary services, J.P. Morgan is able to provide multibank payment initiation and reporting, drawing on SWIFT capabilities without requiring SWIFT connectivity. “These services can also complement the use of SWIFT to optimally support a company’s financial operations,” he says.</p>
<h3 id="taking-swift-to-the-next-level">Taking SWIFT to the next level</h3>
<p>Aside from the potential benefits of a SWIFT connection itself, new services and solutions designed specifically for corporates are helping treasurers to realise further value through SWIFT. The introduction of electronic bank account management (eBAM) solutions for SWIFT, for example, is assisting treasurers to future-proof their operations. “We were particularly excited at the potential of SWIFT to bring interoperability and clear, established standards to the corporate-to-bank space,” says Burn. “At J.P. Morgan we have put a great deal of focus on the proof of concept around eBAM and the corporate benefits are significant. For those treasurers considering a SWIFT implementation, eBAM has the potential to take the value proposition one step further.”</p>
<p>Cofer believes that while eBAM is still in its infancy it may, in time, “replace paper, wet ink signatures and manual processing with electronic documents, digital security credentials and automation.” Using a series of 15 eXtensible Markup Language (XML) messages, all based on the ISO 20022 standard that provides the financial industry with a universal messaging design, corporates will be able to send instructions to their bank to open an account, change authorisations or close an account. Requests can be submitted either using a bank-hosted web portal to affect accounts at that particular bank, or via direct connection with all their banks using SWIFT FileAct or host-to-host.</p>
<div class="boxed">
<h4 id="what-is-ebam">What is eBAM?</h4>
<p>Electronic bank account management, or eBAM, is the electronification and automation of the total bank account management cycle, from account opening to maintenance to closing. eBAM eliminates paper exchange between treasury and bank and enables corporates to self-service common account administration activities. By streamlining and automating bank account management processes, eBAM will:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Provide corporates greater transparency, security and control over their bank relationships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce error risk and collapse cycle times to execute changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Track and monitor account activities automatically, increasing visibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable audit reporting and improve control of account management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Free-up scarce treasury resources for more value-added, strategic activities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>“J.P. Morgan, along with SWIFT and other leading banks, promotes the use of agreed-upon industry standard models for eBAM messaging and security to reduce cost and improve adoption,” continues Cofer. ISO 20022 provides a single messaging format, a central dictionary of financial communication items and a set of XML design rules that are expected to lower cost and make the paper-to-electronic transition simpler for all players. On the security front, J.P. Morgan advocates the use of the interoperable credentials with eBAM to replace the proprietary infrastructures banks currently use. A digital credential that can be used on networks like SWIFT as well as the internet will allow clients to manage their various banking relationships with greater ease. “SWIFT 3SKey has seen encouraging adoption in specific regions as well as uptake in the eBAM vendor community, and we view these initial events as important steps towards achieving credential interoperability in wholesale banking” adds Cofer.</p>
<p>“We would recommend any corporate who has not considered eBAM to at least investigate it, in particular those embarking on a SWIFT implementation,” concludes Burn. After all, the demand for service innovation that benefits corporates’ bottom lines and provides enhanced control has never been greater. The combined eBAM and SWIFT proposition looks set to provide significant value to corporates. Indeed, the word ‘commodity’ is increasingly being applied to the corporate-to-bank communication channel of the future, where SWIFT will no longer be viewed as ‘nice to have’ but as an essential.</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Despite advances in bank connectivity, many corporates are still connecting to their banks individually, with different data streams and different formats to contend with. At the same time, proprietary bank connections, which make it difficult for corporations to change banking relationships, are looking less attractive to treasurers, who are more conscious than ever of bank counterparty risk. As a result, treasurers are showing more interest in multi-bank connectivity solutions. This Business Briefing reviews the types of solution on offer and how to choose between them.</p>
<p>Bank connectivity has come a long way in the last 20 years. However, for large corporations working with a number of different banks, connecting with these banks individually is far from ideal, with data coming from different feeds and formatted differently.</p>
<p>The answer could be to adopt a solution which allows corporates to connect to all of their banks in a more standardised way. In recent years banks have veered away from proprietary connections and are increasingly focused on working together to develop multi-bank connectivity solutions.</p>
<p>So far, so good – but for corporations today, there are a number of different connectivity options available, all of which have different pros and cons.</p>
<h3 id="the-argument-for-multi-bank-connectivity">The argument for multi-bank connectivity</h3>
<p>Corporates are moving away from maintaining proprietary connections with each bank in favour of adopting multi-bank connectivity solutions. This is happening at all levels; the physical connection, where SWIFT is one well-publicised option; the integration of corporate ERP engines with bank systems; and the application of emerging global standards like XML ISO20022 to the actual language of the information being sent and received between a corporate and its banks.</p>
<p>However, current multi-bank solutions are still limited in their richness and potential. “That’s leading to a plateau which we’re fast approaching, where the current offerings in the marketplace get the larger corporates connected and give them some degree of benefit – but not a great deal beyond that,” says Marcus Treacher, Head of e-Commerce, Global Transaction Banking, HSBC. “And the methods used and the associated costs are not really applicable to smaller organisations.”</p>
<p>The arguments for and against multi-bank connectivity vary depending on the size of the company. Larger corporates with a turnover of more than €25 billion have the resources currently needed to get the most out of such a solution: they can afford to pay SWIFT direct-connection rental charges or ERP software charges, and they can afford to hire dedicated project teams to meet with banking providers and determine the content of the messages. For smaller organisations, on the other hand, these costs may be prohibitive.</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, small corporates with one or two banking relationships have little to gain by investing in a multi-bank solution. But those in the middle, the mid-caps, may have enough banks to make this type of connectivity attractive – for the right price.</p>
<p>“Creating a connection proposition that really is ‘plug and play’ across banks is important to get the middle market and smaller corps to see value in connecting,” comments Treacher.</p>
<h3 id="connectivity-options-for-mid-caps">Connectivity options for mid-caps</h3>
<p>So how is this shortfall being addressed? Aside from a direct connection, SWIFT offers corporates two lower cost connectivity options: service bureaus and Alliance Lite.</p>
<p>Launched in 2008, Alliance Lite was intended to offer corporates a lower cost means of accessing SWIFT. The service is intended for corporates with a turnover of €500m – €1 billion who are looking to exchange less than 200 messages per day. “It hasn’t really developed at the pace that SWIFT would have hoped for,” comments Treacher. “The main reason is that its front end – the browser – is fairly limited in scope: basically an internet method of sending a SWIFT message, which doesn’t give a corporate user a great deal.</p>
<p>“However, Alliance Lite does have an interesting complementary service; a software tool that a corporate can install with its internal systems, enabling them to connect directly to SWIFT. That has more promise, and is showing good signs of adoption, but it will take more time to settle in.”</p>
<p>According to Treacher, service bureaus are currently a more attractive proposition for corporates looking for low-cost access to SWIFT. Aimed at corporates with a turnover of €1 billion – €25 billion, these bureaus provide the same services as Alliance Lite, but in addition they handle the SWIFT formatting and SWIFT management which corporates would otherwise have to do. In addition, the higher volumes processed by bureaus make this option cheaper than Alliance Lite.</p>

</figure>
<p>There are a number of service bureau providers in the market offering different added value services. Some banks also act as member-concentrators, which is a similar offering to service bureaus. “It is a free market, and I think corporates do well to shop around and find providers they can work with,” says Treacher.</p>
<p>As a variation on the theme, ERP and TMS providers are beginning to look into developing connection solutions with both banks and SWIFT, so that their software effectively starts behaving like a bureau, with SWIFT sitting inside. “That’s very promising going forward, and if you could combine that with a cloud computing approach – ie renting applications rather than buying them outright – where the corporate just connects to their ERP provider’s systems housed in a remote datacentre, within which is a SWIFT connection,” comments Treacher. “After all, that’s what a bureau is – a data centre that someone rents out to you.”</p>
<h3 id="multi-bank-connectivity-beyond-swift">Multi-bank connectivity beyond SWIFT</h3>
<p>SWIFT is not the only option for corporates looking for multi-bank connectivity. Another option is to use the open internet, supported by another encryption and authentication method such as Identrust or SWIFT’s 3SKey, and to adhere to common global standards. This is where XML 20022 comes in.</p>
<p>“Companies that work at that level are able to get much more value out of the corporate connectivity relationship,” says Treacher. “What they are doing is streamlining their treasury process by making sure that the information that comes back from their banks, which they use to reconcile against their payments, can fit perfectly inside their ERP systems for automatic reconciliation. So it takes a huge amount of manual work away.</p>
<p>“They can also automate the other financial processes around assessment of risk and assessment of cash flow forecasting. As long as the information coming back from their partner banks is standardised, it’s possible to treat those banks as if they were branches of the same organisation.”</p>
<p>Over 700 corporates are now connected to SWIFT, but there is no means of counting the number of corporates adopting multi-bank connectivity over the open internet. However, Treacher estimates that the number of top corporates opting for this route is at least as large as the number choosing SWIFT connectivity.</p>
<p>Caveats to bear in mind when considering this approach are that the open internet connection doesn’t provide the level of security given by a secure network like SWIFT – nor are messages independently verified.</p>
<h3 id="competition-or-collaboration">Competition or collaboration?</h3>
<p>Historically, bank connectivity has been viewed by the banks as a competitive space, with banks providing corporates with proprietary connections which made it difficult for corporates to switch providers. However, largely driven by demand from corporates for a more standardised approach, in recent years this focus has changed.</p>
<p>The benefits for corporates are clear: in addition to enabling data to be collated more efficiently, avoiding the issue of multiple standards, multi-bank connectivity also means that it is easier to change banking relationships. While some banks may suffer from no longer locking clients in to proprietary software, many others are welcoming the opportunity of competing more effectively for business.</p>
<p>“Banks have started saying, what would happen if we did do things together?” says Treacher. “What we’ve found is that the more we collaborate on this basis, ironically the more potential opens up. If you are a strong bank with good credentials and high service quality, if you can tick all the boxes, then being able to pick up more of your clients’ business without barriers is good for you. On the other hand, it’s bad news for banks that are poor at what they do. Clients can transfer traffic to banks they are more comfortable with.”</p>
<p>Treacher also argues that with less of a focus on the mechanics of connectivity, banks will be able to improve their own service quality and focus more wholeheartedly on differentiating themselves through their offerings. “Corporates can get more attentive banking providers, can reward those that do a good job, can get out of relationships that aren’t working for them.”</p>
<p>A number of banks are now actively pursuing the multi-banking approach by offering access to a number of different banks via their own portals.</p>

<h3 id="pierre-fabre-laboratories">Pierre Fabre Laboratories</h3>
<div class="people vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Yann Guengant</h4>
<h5 class="title">Assistant Group Treasurer</h5>
<img alt="Pierre Fabre logo" class="logo org" height="32" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/pierre-fabre-2011-100x32.png" title="Pierre Fabre" width="100"/>
</div>
<p class="management-summary">Pierre Fabre Laboratories (“Pierre Fabre”) comprises three key business areas: pharmaceutical, dermo-cosmetics and family healthcare. The company employs 9,800 staff and had a turnover in 2009 of €1.8 billion, 50% of which was derived from its international activities. Group Treasury is made up of five people who manage the treasury requirements for France, which includes both the holding company and 40 subsidiaries. The company is also present in a further 35 countries which have not historically been covered by Group Treasury.</p>
<p>A decentralised approach to treasury and cash management made it difficult for Pierre Fabre to apply consistent policies and procedures globally. As a result, visibility and control over cash, cash management efficiency and risk management procedures were limited. In order to standardise cash management at a global level, the decision was taken to establish a global centre for treasury and cash management. At the same time, the company was looking to leverage SWIFTNet in order to achieve standardised connectivity between Pierre Fabre’s entities and the banks – in essence, creating a virtual payment factory.</p>
<p>“With the existing treasury technology framework relatively fragmented, the first step was to centralise the treasury systems infrastructure to reduce the number of systems and data silos currently in operation and leverage the standardisation that SWIFT offers,” comments Yann Guengant, Assistant Group Treasurer. “Without a standardised approach to technology, it is difficult to implement and monitor global treasury policies and processes, to manage risk, to strengthen security or to leverage shared investments in technology. By rationalising and standardising our technology and communication infrastructure, our people will be able to spend time analysing, rather than inputting, information in order to make better and faster decisions.”</p>
<p>In order to facilitate a global approach to reporting and real-time information sharing, a third-party system was implemented which would act as the internal communication highway for connecting the various applications across the group. “Information is then consolidated within the system and consolidated files are transmitted through to HSBC,” explains Yann Guengant. “HSBC then sends the relevant messages to the appropriate banks.”</p>
<p>Pierre Fabre Laboratories assessed a range of different connectivity solutions for communicating with the company’s numerous banks, assessing geographic range, range of services and support for XML-based standards and protocols. “We quickly recognised that proprietary electronic banking tools would not support our requirements; not only are they inconsistent in their formats and security protocols, but we would need to replicate our systems infrastructure across each of our 60 banks,” says Yann Guengant. “Similarly, there were limitations with host-to-host systems, as they were also proprietary and not standardised; furthermore, as they would be ‘hard coded’ into our business, our ability to flex our banking relationships in the future would be compromised.</p>
<p>“We recognised that SWIFT was a global solution with a growing range of services available. SWIFT provides both a communication network (SWIFTNet) and acts as a standards body, so it is in a position to drive standardisation and international adoption of common formats. The security provided through SWIFTNet is best in class and provides users with significant protection through authentication, non-repudiation and message delivery guarantees.”</p>
<p>Once the decision had been taken to connect to SWIFTNet, the next step was to decide whether to connect directly – requiring Pierre Fabre to manage its own infrastructure – or indirectly, by outsourcing to a third party. Yann Guengant soon realised that the cost and effort required for direct connectivity would be prohibitive and the Service Buruea option was chosen. “The key to selecting the right Service Bureau was to ensure that our connection to SWIFT would be no weaker than SWIFT itself, so we were sure to check potential Service Bureaus’ availability, security, resilience, service level agreement and financial standing,” explains Yann Guengant. “Most were small software companies, which led to some concerns about the impact on our activities if their business were to fail. We decided that we would have greater leverage, as well as more confidence in business continuity, if we selected a Service Bureau supported by a bank.</p>
<p>“There are clearly some potential issues with this approach too – after all, we were looking for a Service Bureau to act as a processor in sending and receiving information to and from multiple banks globally, and we did not want these bank relationships to be compromised. Consequently, there needed to be some boundaries between the activities of the Service Bureau and the bank.”</p>
<p>The decision was taken to contract with HSBC for Service Bureau services. “The service is delivered by a third party, but the support of a banking partner with the financial standing of HSBC gave us considerable confidence in the continuity and integrity of the service. HSBC is a member of our revolving credit facility and provides cash management services in the UK, Mexico and Czech Republic, as well as in France,” says Yann Guengant.</p>
<p>In order to ensure the project’s success, it was essential to achieve standardisation internally, thus ensuring that there was no scope for local interpretation. Accordingly, policies and procedures were formulated carefully in order to achieve the right degree of standardisation while ensuring local buy-in.</p>
<p>The new infrastructure is currently undergoing final testing and the virtual payment factory is set to be rolled out later this year, starting in mainland Europe. Yann Guengant has plans to extend the company’s use of SWIFT from cash management to FX and trade finance automating the existing manual processes for FX transactions and confirmations as well as guarantees issuance and management.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="choosing-a-multi-bank-solution">Choosing a multi-bank solution</h3>
<p>While it might seem counterintuitive, Treacher’s advice to treasurers looking for a multi-bank connectivity solution is to ignore the issue of connectivity – at least to start with. Instead, treasurers should focus on the change they are trying to achieve, such as establishing better financial visibility and awareness across the organisation, or centralising operations for greater efficiency, or empowering local treasury teams with greater autonomy to support dynamic businesses.</p>
<p>Once the objective has been identified, the next step is to imagine how this might be achieved in a perfect world. What information would be needed from the banks and when? When do you want to transact with your banks?</p>
<p>Corporates should then start exploring the topic with a group of trusted banks on an informal basis. Again, this conversation should start with the business need: how can automatic reconciliation be achieved? How can the company’s cash concentration needs be met?</p>
<p>“Start really high, and that will lead the conversation naturally like a waterfall down into the message standardisation, the next place to look – the XML, what services the banks can provide,” says Treacher. “Only later should you get into the details of whether or not to go with SWIFT and the technical details. In an ideal solution, the banks you choose to work with should be able to focus on your commercial needs.”</p>
<h3 id="the-future">The future</h3>
<p>Treacher sees the next couple of years as key to the development of multi-bank connectivity. As well as working more closely with competitors, the solutions on offer are set to evolve in conjunction with non-banking service providers.</p>
<p>“There are some exciting ideas brewing. The more you standardise the basics, the more potential you get,” comments Treacher. “It could be possible to integrate extra services such as getting really good updates on jurisdictional barriers to cash pooling. Then there are the extremities of the business cycle, both at the distribution and the sourcing end, and the whole supply chain in between. It all happens outside banking. If a banking service provider becomes ubiquitous and standardised and open, it will be possible to offer end to end services.”</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p>With mounting pressure to improve efficiency and visibility by streamlining the end-to-end flow of information, treasurers are increasingly looking for ways to conduct business electronically. In this Business Briefing we look at how corporate connectivity is being standardised through developments in SWIFT and the adoption of ISO 20022. We also examine how growing confidence in the use of technology has led to increased demand for interactive electronic banking platforms.</p>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Corporate treasurers have long sought more effective ways to conduct business electronically with their banking partners. In the case of larger, more complex organisations, the array of ERP systems, combined with the business requirement to utilise services from several banking partners, has accentuated the need for streamlining the end-to-end information flow to ensure adequate visibility and control. This has in turn driven focus on straight through processing (STP) and standardisation as the means towards that end.</p>
<p>These standardisation efforts can be categorised in two distinct areas, as outlined below:</p>
<h4 id="standardisation-of-connectivity-infrastructure">Standardisation of connectivity infrastructure</h4>
<p>The use of SWIFT by corporates as a means to enable connectivity to multiple banks has seen steady growth in recent years. Rather than requiring an individual connection to each bank, which in practical terms usually means two connections to each bank (one for regular use and one for contingency purposes), SWIFT offers a single connection to multiple SWIFT member banks. This connection is more reliable and secure than the internet as it is a members-only, closed network and therefore less prone to security breaches.</p>
<p>As SWIFT has evolved from a bank-to-bank platform to a corporate-to-bank platform, initially through Member Administered-Closed User Groups (MA-CUGs) and then through the Standardised Corporate Environment (SCORE), its processes, protocols and requirements have been streamlined. In addition, SCORE membership will now be available to a wider population of corporates with new membership criteria meaning that any corporate with the recommendation of a bank active in the SWIFT for Corporates environment may now join.</p>
<p>Even with all this work, the integration process still has a degree of complexity which has given rise to the increasing usage of service bureaus. By using service bureaus, corporates can access SWIFT and avoid the capital investment and technological expertise required for setting up the infrastructure and its ongoing maintenance. The service bureau sector has also matured, and the landscape is now dominated by larger companies that are global in scope.</p>
<h4 id="the-role-of-banks">The role of banks</h4>
<p>Banks have also played an important part in enabling this move towards SWIFT. They have taken the prevailing bank-to-bank model and adapted it to suit the needs of corporate customers. Manish Jain, Global Head, Electronic Channels, Global Transaction Services explains, “At Citi we have taken it to the next level by providing a complete infrastructure to support the corporates through offerings such as the Citi SWIFT Xchange.</p>
<p>Through a single Bank Identifier Code (BIC) model corporates are able to transact with any of Citi’s branches worldwide via a local BIC. Citi leverages its global network infrastructure to automatically route to the correct destination within its own branches. This provides true STP and significant reduction in SWIFT messaging costs as all the SWIFT messages from the corporate to Citi are local and not international.”</p>
<h4 id="standardisation-of-instruction-formats">Standardisation of instruction formats</h4>
<p>In the absence of truly interoperable industry standards, banks and corporates created the standardised XML format — ISO 20022. However, the adoption of this standard has not yet gained the desired momentum, despite the obvious benefits, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Provision of a consistent model which reduces the complexity and number of system interfaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased ease of automation of business processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Standardisation of all areas of financial activity within the business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facilitation of a homogenous set of security standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promotion of more efficient and effective cash management with real-time data availability.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These benefits all lead to opportunities to improve the working capital cycle, enable economies of scale, open up a wider choice of service providers and reduce the need for manual intervention in financial processing activities.</p>
<p>For some corporates, the treasury optimisation process has evolved beyond the initial STP objectives. To a large extent, there has been an automation of the data-gathering process. This has resulted in a reduction in the need for human intervention and therefore the management role tends to be exception-based.</p>
<p>The most pressing challenge facing treasurers in this area is achieving straight through reconciliation. Some of the necessary information required to achieve straight through reconciliation is readily available. However, much valuable information is often lost during complex transaction flows in the processing cycle within the corporate, bank and market infrastructures, such as clearing houses.</p>
<p>The result is that, while companies might have the necessary data on the initiated instructions, they are often missing key information on the statements to reconcile them properly. Consequently, effective or straightforward reconciliation is impossible because crucial information has been lost or is in the incorrect format.</p>
<p>The use of ISO 20022 as a standard for payments initiation has many obvious benefits for corporates, some of which are mentioned above. However, the advantages it also provides for reconciliation may not be so immediately apparent. ISO 20022, with its built-in structure and interoperability, has the potential to help ease some day-to-day reconciliation issues with the capture of critical data, such as the end-to-end ID. The end-to-end ID is a payment reference generated by the originator. It is carried through the end-to-end payment chain and reported to the creditor. It may be used by a beneficiary as a basis to investigate the payment transaction.</p>
<p>The move to ISO XML may not be that simple for a large number of corporates, however. “It is here that Citi is working on ways of helping corporates address this need by innovative solutions that utilise a variety of information received from corporates with their payments instructions and intelligently reconnecting with the accounting transactions generated as a result of execution,” explains Jain.</p>
<h3 id="online-banking-expands">Online banking expands</h3>
<p>Traditionally, online banking has been used by treasurers simply as a tool for transaction initiation. Electronic banking systems have had limited flexibility built into them, allowing users only basic preferences such as use of local language and payment templates. In the imminent future, online banking is set to undergo radical change with a much greater degree of personalisation and customisation.</p>
<p>Instead of simply changing one or two elements of an online banking platform, it will be possible to rearrange the nature of the platform and simplify the workflow of applications associated with it to meet specific clients’ needs. More importantly, there has been a shift in opinion towards online banking offerings.</p>

<h5 class="title">Treasury Manager, Asia-Pacific region</h5>
<img alt="Jabil" class="logo org" height="15" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/jabil-logo-2009-90x15.png" width="90"/>
</div>
<p class="management-summary">US-headquartered Jabil is an electronic manufacturing services company, providing electronics design, production and product management.</p>
<h4 id="the-challenge">The challenge</h4>
<p>Jabil was making several thousand payments each month without a centralised cash management structure. Following rapid expansion by acquisition, Jabil wanted to increase central control of payments. The company also wanted to lower costs, increase efficiency by reducing manual processes and enhance risk management and compliance.</p>
<p>In 2006, as part of a new ERP system rollout, Jabil decided to integrate its operations in India, Malaysia, Singapore, Japan, Vietnam and Taiwan through a single delivery channel. The company also wanted to integrate China, where it has ten entities, despite the challenges associated with centralising local Chinese payments from an offshore location.</p>
<h4 id="the-solution">The solution</h4>
<p>Citi won an RFP in October 2006 on the strength of its Asian branch network and the technical capabilities of its Citi<sup>®</sup> File Xchange (CFX) and CitiDirect<sup>®</sup> Online Banking offerings. CitiDirect<sup>®</sup> was able to offer real-time visibility and control over Jabil’s bank accounts in Asia and enable automated report generation.</p>
<p>The offering also manages reconciliation and reporting. CFX provides a seamless local connection and enables straight through processing by translating files generated by Jabil’s ERP system and acting as a gateway for host-to-host connectivity.</p>
<p>Jabil’s ERP system uses a Latin alphabet database, so for local currency payments in China (which require Chinese characters) Citi devised abbreviated codes, which are then enriched with bank information to become regular payment files. In order to accommodate local documentation requirements relating to FX payments, such as sales contracts and local approvals, Citi offered to check documentation onsite for Jabil.</p>
<h4 id="the-result">The result</h4>
<p>An implementation team was established in May 2007, with Malaysia as the first country to have been chosen for the ERP rollout and China as the second. The ERP system is now fully implemented, and the integration of Jabil’s Asian operations into a single delivery channel (each country took around two months) is complete.</p>
<p>Implementation went smoothly and Jabil has gained the control it sought over local payments and enjoyed substantial efficiency savings. “Citi has local people throughout Asia who know the regulations and concerns,” says Hantai Qin, Treasury Manager, Asia-Pacific region at Jabil. “At the same time, Citi’s Asia people co-ordinated the project and really focused on the big picture.”</p>
</div>
<p>They are no longer seen as external to the corporate environment, they are considered an integral part of the corporates’ processes. A properly integrated solution can act as an enabler to further streamline the corporate workflow and make it more efficient. These changes will ensure improved integration with clients’ workflow, thereby enhancing productivity and efficiency.</p>
<p>One of the key areas of interest for most corporates is an electronic bank account management (eBAM) offering that covers all aspects from account opening or closing to ‘regular signer’ management which can be embedded into the client work process. In other words, the new online offerings should function as a virtual branch with a comprehensive list of services being provided electronically.</p>
<p>This will allow corporates easy access to a wide range of functions that typically required a call or follow-up with a service desk, such as initiating service requests for transaction investigations and exceptions. It will also allow corporates to better manage their banking needs and provide complete transparency, visibility and control.</p>
<p>This change in electronic banking has become possible for two main reasons. Firstly, because the underlying technological infrastructure has become more robust, as well as increasingly capable of handling more complex tasks and granular information. Platforms today are quite simply better than they were, and can be more effectively integrated with other aspects of a corporate’s business process components, such as ERP systems or service bureaus, in order to improve STP rates.</p>
<p>Secondly, confidence in using more complex electronic banking technologies has increased in recent years. Most internet users are now familiar with interactive Web 2.0 technologies and social networking applications. Understandably, users want the same level of interactivity from their electronic banking platform as they do from other internet applications. They also want to be able to customise their electronic banking platform as they would any other software to facilitate more effective multitasking. Moreover, treasury users now see banking as another one of their core activities and therefore expect it to be integrated with their other functions.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>Ultimately, electronic banking platforms will become information platforms, rather than solely transaction platforms. New generation electronic platforms will combine regulatory information and market data with expert opinions and powerful analytical tools that help to drive treasury decisions. The latest online offerings that are being developed and launched by banks will persist in pushing the limits in this area.</p>
<p>“For example,” says Jain, “Citi’s next-generation electronic banking platform called CitiDirect<sup>®</sup> BE (Banking Evolution) is designed to significantly change the way corporates access Citi’s global banking services – the result will be a huge transformation in what clients can achieve using this new banking platform. With a completely redesigned offering centred on enabling the corporate’s work processes, it can improve the user experience and also facilitate further integration into the client’s environment.”</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Since the beginning of 2008 the payments landscape has changed considerably. The introduction of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) and growing adoption of SWIFT for Corporates have had a significant impact. The focus on standardisation, centralisation and security in this area has also intensified.</p>
<p>As the payments environment has developed, so too has the role of the corporate treasurer. Treasurers are, now more than ever, responsible for ensuring that processes are as streamlined as possible, and of course, compliant.</p>
<p>Banks have echoed this trend by seeking to create global solutions for corporate customers that meet both industry requirements and treasurers’ needs. A forward-looking prototype of such a solution is UniCredit’s eBanking platform with SWIFT connectivity, as it will capture the benefits of both technologies.</p>
<h3 id="swift-for-corporates">SWIFT for Corporates</h3>
<p>SWIFT is the banking industry-owned co-operative supplying secure, standardised messaging services and interface software to nearly 8,200 financial institutions in 208 countries worldwide. SWIFT has been a success story on the interbank side for the last 30 years and since 2001, it has been available to corporates as a means of communicating with their banks.</p>
<p>SWIFTNet, SWIFT’s latest communication protocol, provides corporates with the opportunity to exchange financial information (payments, securities orders, reporting) with their banks through one secure, standardised platform, as opposed to multiple connections through electronic banking SYSTEMS. There are currently three ways that a corporate customer can access SWIFTNet: as a TRCO (Treasury Counterparty), by joining one or more MA-CUGs (Member Administered Closed User Groups) and by utilising SCORE (Standardised Corporate Environment). UniCredit offers MA-CUG services and is registered in SCORE, giving corporates full connectivity to the SWIFTNet network and the capability to perform many different messaging services.</p>
<p>One of the primary reasons why UniCredit decided to offer SWIFTNet to corporates, large, medium and small was “the ability to offer a solution that is really global without (the corporate) needing the capability to develop or deploy that on their own.” There are also clear customer benefits in providing SWIFTNet to corporates as it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Provides a homogenised communication infrastructure with banks around the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meets the highest security and availability standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offers independence from proprietary country standards and single bank electronic-banking products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simplifies implementation and auditing of statutory payment regulations with global impact (eg Sarbanes-Oxley).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Streamlines centralised, worldwide payments, account information, FX confirmations, enquiries, bilateral data exchange in standard or local format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can generate substantial savings in resources, for example: controlling, administrative processes, and documentation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Markus Straußfeld, Managing Director, Cash Management and eBanking Sales, UniCredit comments: “UniCredit fully supports SWIFTNet for its corporate customers, enabling them to connect to any of their banking partners via one single access. A corporate treasurer’s dream come true.”</p>
<h3 id="ebanking">eBanking</h3>
<p>Electronic banking has played a prominent role in changing the face of the financial services industry, in terms of environmental impact as well as technologically. Banks are offering an ever increasing range of online services and products as corporates continue to seek automation and strive to fall in line with green policies. Corporates are demanding integrated, real-time solutions to enhance straight through processing (STP) within their operations and processes so as to improve – and ideally lessen the burden of – cash management.</p>
<p>Although electronic banking platforms are state-of-the-art, the introduction of common standards, as with many technological developments, represents a significant obstacle. Often, the ability to transfer information across different platforms within an organisation is hard enough, let alone between banks in different geographic locations.</p>
<h3 id="tailor-made-solution">Tailor-made solution</h3>
<p>In light of the challenges faced by corporates, and not content with offering an everyday SWIFT solution, UniCredit then proceeded to innovate and enhance its product offering by combining corporate access to SWIFT with its classic eBanking technology:</p>
<div class="boxed">
<figure class="center">
<figcaption>
<h5 id="diagram-1-europeangate">Diagram 1: EuropeanGate</h5>
</figcaption>
<a class="enlargeable" href="http://treasurytoday.com/i/2008/10/2008-10-tt-10-pp-diagram-01-european-gate.png"><img alt="Diagram 1: EuropeanGate" height="147" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/2008/10/2008-10-tt-10-pp-diagram-01-european-gate-t.png" width="300"/></a>
</figure>
<p>EuropeanGate is the payment platform used within the UniCredit Group.</p>
<p>Through a single entry point, payment instructions can be forwarded, payments can be routed and conversion services can be carried out.</p>
<p>EuropeanGate covers all countries within the group. By operating a single account through the platform, customers can have the equivalent of a local account in each country, if desired.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="key-features-and-benefits">Key features and benefits</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Simplicity.</h5>
<p>Although the technology behind the platform is state-of-the art, UniCredit’s solution is purposely uncomplicated so that it is not hindered by the high daily volumes that are expected by corporate customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Centralisation of payment traffic.</h5>
<p>The aim is for each corporate to have only one point of entry, ie one platform to handle all of its payment transactions, both domestic and international. In turn, standardisation of formats, together with same day processing, will reduce wastage of both time and money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Reliability.</h5>
<p>UniCredit chose to build upon existing, proven systems, ie their eBanking product and SWIFT, so that the platform would be robust and reliable. The aim was not to ‘reinvent the wheel’ but to innovate using trustworthy technologies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Compliance.</h5>
<p>The platform will be able to perform Single European Payments Area (SEPA) compliant functions as well as a range of international operations outside the scope of SEPA, thereby enhancing the global reach of the platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Usage of electronic signature.</h5>
<p>Many countries now use digital signatures for their eBanking but SWIFT does not support the use of such electronic authorisations. Integrating SWIFT into an eBanking platform may mitigate the need for double authorisation and according to Franz Zahn, Head of Global eBanking Development, “This will make the ‘step in’ easier and also more attractive for smaller and non multinational corporate customers.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Advice/administration.</h5>
<p>To complement its offering, UniCredit is the first point of contact for any product related advice and will undertake any SWIFT related administration on behalf of the customer. UniCredit also carries out all the necessary SWIFT updates on behalf of customers, which highlights the user friendly nature of the solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Cost.</h5>
<p>Corporates will not have to invest in any middleware for SWIFT connectivity or indeed purchase a SWIFT interface. Maintenance and updates will also be UniCredit’s responsibility, not the corporate’s. This removes a significant access barrier for many medium and smaller sized companies. The corporate does of course have to join the appropriate MACUGs or qualify as a SCORE user.</p>

</div>
<h5 id="why-did-unicredit-decide-to-introduce-a-combined-ebanking-and-swiftnet-service">Why did UniCredit decide to introduce a combined eBanking and SWIFTNet service?</h5>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>JL:</span> UniCredit is a frontrunner in this area. With regard to corporate access to SWIFTNet, we are number three in the world in terms of volumes and with regard to filing services, expertise and customer contact we are one of the top banks in Europe.</p>
<p>This is a strategic product for UniCredit as we are constantly looking for improvements and enhancements to our services. The corporate side of SWIFT is too complex for corporates who don’t have the resources to cover a huge project or the IT structure, particularly those who are using SWIFT for the first time.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n0">
<p><span>GH:</span> Yes, the product is designed to ease SWIFT access for large customers who probably would have done it anyway and enable a midsized corporate that would not have been able to access SWIFT before to do so. With globalisation becoming more and more important and with even small companies no longer working in one country, it became imperative for us to offer a network which truly is worldwide.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-makes-unicredits-platform-unique">What makes UniCredit’s platform unique?</h5>
<div class="person n0">
<p><span>GH:</span> A corporate company is in a sense forced to invest in a complete SWIFT interface, even if they are only using a small share of its capability. Why do this, particularly when they have no eBanking functionality in that interface? They somehow have to connect to another system to give them the eBanking functionality they need. What we did is combine these so we give our customers the part of SWIFT that they need, not the lion’s share that they don’t need, and all that within an eBanking product so they get the best of both worlds.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>JL:</span> eBanking helps as SWIFT does not use electronic signatures, whereas local formats and standards might use these. Therefore one of the main challenges was to set up some kind of approval concept internally, not only in the ERP system but also for the connectivity to SWIFTNet. An eBanking platform such as ours could potentially cover that.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="how-do-corporates-access-the-platform">How do corporates access the platform?</h5>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>JL:</span> When a corporate wants to sign up we will set up an electronic banking agreement and then we add users, account numbers, order types for payment instructions etc and at the same time we will add to this a SWIFTNet agreement, so it is a bilateral request.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n0">
<p><span>GH:</span> In Phase I – the product is currently in prototype – the product will be installed at the customers’ premises and then accessed on site or through the internet, that way offering distributed signatures and log-ins. It is planned to offer the same solution from an internet based portal in Phase II.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="why-in-your-opinion-should-corporates-choose-unicredits-solution-over-other-solutions">Why, in your opinion, should corporates choose UniCredit’s solution over other solutions?</h5>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>JL:</span> It’s simpler in the sense that it is less complex and it also gives the customer more flexibility as they can still have access through local standards with other banks. It gives them more independence generally in the banking market because a corporate can contact another bank outside of the UniCredit Group and connect through SWIFTNet. It will be less time consuming and less expensive because corporates do not have to invest in a middleware platform, in extra IT or place processes with an outsourcing company.</p>
<p>What corporates are really complaining about right now is the complexity of accessing SWIFT and that it is too expensive, that’s why we built up this new development.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n0">
<p><span>GH:</span> In addition, we carried out extensive independent and anonymous research on the ground to ensure that our product exactly met our customers’ needs.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h4 id="security">Security</h4>
<p>In today’s environment, stringent security should not be seen as a key feature or benefit of a product – it should be viewed as essential. Many companies have learnt the hard way that a single breach in system security could give rise to sensitive data being disclosed, and ultimately, abused. </p>
<p>UniCredit has ensured a double layer of security for its new platform, with the tested security of its own eBanking platform layered over SWIFT’s secure and reliable network. SWIFT is renowned for its reliability and continuity planning, making the system virtually fail safe. With ‘risk management’ and ‘business continuity’ becoming core phrases in the treasurer’s vocabulary, this extra security is a distinct advantage.</p>
<h4 id="future-developments">Future developments</h4>
<p>UniCredit is currently in talks with a local ERP provider with the aim of developing a seamless integration with existing ERP systems.</p>
<p>It is hoped that this will mitigate file-based cross-linking and thereby reduce any inherent security risk.</p>
<p>In addition, the direct integration of the ERP system into the eBanking platform with SWIFT connectivity could help corporates to improve their IT auditing, which is often a sensitive subject.</p>
<p>UniCredit is also looking to enhance this solution, not only through web-based portal access but also by including SWIFTNet InterAct (InterAct) usage. InterAct offers real-time messaging services. Based on XML standards, InterAct enables an automatic and immediate response to messages between two systems/parties and is therefore targeted at time-critical activities.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>In a turbulent market, a treasurer should to adopt a ‘back to basics’ approach in order to maintain effective systems and controls as well as to meet the demands of an expanding role. UniCredit has thoroughly researched the challenges facing corporates today and has reacted to the broadening responsibilities of treasurers as well as industry requirements and regulations by integrating SWIFT into its eBanking platform. This simple solution has great potential to respond to current demands as well as future developments.</p>
<p>N.B. The eBanking platform with SWIFT connectivity will be piloted after being showcased at Sibos 2008 in September.</p>

<p>A Member Administered Closed User Group (MA-CUG) is a mechanism by which corporates are given access to the SWIFT network. By joining a MA-CUG, a corporate can exchange SWIFT messages with a bank which is a member of the SWIFT network.</p>
<div class="boxed">
<h5 id="swift">SWIFT</h5>
<p>The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) provides secure, standardised messaging services and interface software to 7,800 financial institutions in more than 200 countries. SWIFT has two key roles:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Network provider of secure SWIFT network, linking banks across the globe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Standards authority for the formats of messages exchanged over the network.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>SWIFT messaging formats provide the standard for the vast majority of cross-border transactionrelated information flows between financial institutions.</p>
<p>For more information on SWIFT visit <a href="http://www.swift.com" target="_blank">http://www.swift.com</a></p>
</div>
<h4 id="how-do-they-work">How do they work?</h4>
<p>MA-CUGs can be established by any SWIFT member bank – a bank setting up a MA-CUG will become the administering bank for that MA-CUG. The administering bank can then invite its corporate clients to join the MA-CUG. Every corporate member of the MA-CUG will then be able to exchange messages using the SWIFT network with the administering bank and with any of the banks’ branches that have also registered into the MA-CUG. </p>
<p>All corporate access to the SWIFT network must be routed via the administering bank – corporate members of a MA-CUG cannot use the SWIFT network to communicate directly with each other, nor with any other SWIFT member bank. However, corporates can join as many MA-CUGs as they like to cover their banking activities. The diagram to the right illustrates how a MA-CUG works.</p>

<h4 id="why-join-a-ma-cug">Why join a MA-CUG?</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Reduced technological complexity.</h5>
<p>In order to communicate directly with their banking partners, corporates generally have to establish secure network connections and build interfaces between their systems and the banks’ proprietary systems. Most large corporates have multiple banking partners and thus have to build and maintain separate connections and interfaces for each of their banking partners.</p>
<p>The SWIFT network and messaging standards are however global. Corporates which are members of MA-CUGs only need to build and maintain one SWIFT interface to connect directly to each of their banking partners. Corporates can also connect indirectly to SWIFT through a Member/Concentrator or service bureau.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Bulk payment.</h5>
<p>The SWIFTNet FileAct service, available to corporate members of MA-CUGs, allows corporates to generate bulk payment messages which are then sent via the SWIFT network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Lower messaging fees.</h5>
<p>Corporate MA-CUG members pay SWIFT directly for messaging fees (thus avoiding the charge banks typically levy on top of the SWIFT fee). SWIFT also offers volume discounts, lowering the costs further. FileAct also supports proprietary standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Standardisation.</h5>
<p>The standardised nature of SWIFT message formats enables companies to implement a single protocol for each type of payment message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Security. </h5>
<p>The SWIFT network is incredibly secure. Making a payment via a direct connection to the SWIFT network is one of the most secure payment methods in the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Straight through processing. </h5>
<p>Payments initiated in an ERP system, TMS or accounting system can be directly converted into a SWIFT payment message and routed directly through the SWIFT network. Similarly, SWIFT payment messages sent to a company will be routed straight into the company’s systems where they can be automatically reconciled – this is true STP.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-are-the-drawbacks-of-joining-a-ma-cug">What are the drawbacks of joining a MA-CUG?</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Multiple banks, multiple MA-CUGs.</h5>
<p>The MA-CUG structure requires corporates to join a separate MA-CUG for each bank it wishes to exchange SWIFT messages with, although joining is easier than it was. However, the SWIFT interface a corporate has to build to join a MA-CUG can be used to join other MA-CUGs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Cost of implementation.</h5>
<p>Companies wishing to join a MA-CUG will need to invest in SWIFTcompliant systems to provide the interface between their in-house systems and the SWIFT network. Depending on the technology platform and systems in situ, this can be a very costly and time-consuming process. Before embarking on a MA-CUG implementation project, you should be absolutely sure that the benefits of joining a MA-CUG will outweigh this initial outlay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>SWIFT joining requirements. </h5>
<p>Corporates joining a MA-CUG are effectively opting to become a corporate member of SWIFT. The joining procedures for corporates are identical to those for banks. The criteria for joining SWIFT are stringent. The process is not complex in itself. Access to SWIFT is however taken very seriously. An extensive review of all systems, security issues and staff training should be undertaken before joining SWIFT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Service levels vary.</h5>
<p>Different banks provide different services as part of their MA-CUG package (eg not all SWIFTNet products are offered by every bank). SWIFT provides a directory of MA-CUGs enabled banks on its website. Over 100 banks including all the major cash management banks are already MA-CUG enabled. Companies need to ensure they understand the range of services, messages and functionalities a particular MA-CUG provides.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>SWIFT formats may not actually be totally identical between the banks.</h5>
<p>In reality, corporate users of MA-CUGS report that there are very slight differences and some ‘tweaking’ of the interfaces may be necessary. In other words, it is not as easy as it sounds to establish the interfaces.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="who-uses-ma-cugs">Who uses MA-CUGs?</h4>
<p>Although there has been a significant increase in the number of corporates joining MA-CUGs, the numbers opting to do so are still relatively low (see table below)</p>

<h4 id="the-future-of-ma-cugs">The future of MA-CUGs</h4>
<p>A proposal to evolve corporate access to SWIFT will be presented and discussed at the June 2006 board meeting and we will report on any developments in future issues. The existing MA-CUG structure is expected to remain and the existing MA-CUGs will remain in place.</p>
