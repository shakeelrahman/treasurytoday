<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Awash with trillions of dollars in capital to put to work, private equity investors are snapping up listed companies like UK supermarket chain Morrisons, German pet group Zooplus, US-listed Chinese recruitment group 51jobs or the ongoing circling of Toshiba. Once private equity takes the helm, treasury must buckle up for a new strategic, hands-on direction driven by balance sheet efficiency and a greater focus on working capital that puts conventional treasury on steroids. “Treasury has to respond under private equity and align to a new culture of business change and things done at speed,” says Ian Fleming, Treasurer at the UK’s now defunct department store Debenhams when it was under private equity ownership between 2003 and 2007. “Be quick, be good and be gone,” he says, recalling his mantra at the time.</p>
<h4 id=""driving-factors"">Driving factors</h4>
<p>Years of central bank quantitative easing and rock bottom interest rates have created a world awash with capital that has private equity investors currently sitting on an estimated US$1.32trn of dry powder. “Private equity is a cyclical market that is the function of the price of assets, debt service costs and the availability of credit,” says Fleming, referencing the factors linked to today’s demand which although exacerbated by pandemic policy, also drove the boom in the asset class in the mid-2000s until the market crashed after the GFC.</p>
<p>Important other factors are also driving demand. Private equity houses target companies with robust cash flows and significant growth potential that they aim to sell within three to five years. UK listed companies, hit by low valuations compared to public markets in the US (and to a lesser extent Europe) due to Brexit and the fall in the pound, have attracted the keenest interest, but low public market valuations relative to private valuations are not unique to the UK.</p>
<p>Take two companies, one public and one private and both in the same industry going through a sale process, the listed company will have a lower multiple than the private one. “There used to be a premium for being listed but now the premium isn’t there and even a discount may apply,” explains Alvaro Membrillera, a partner in law firm Paul Weiss’s corporate department and head of the firm’s London office. “If you have a company going through a dual-track sale process, it is no longer a surprise that a trade sale achieves a higher valuation than the IPO.”</p>
<p>The reason? Rigorous prepping and readying of private companies to optimise sale value leaves private firms with less value extraction down the line. Private owners have already addressed problematic issues like underperforming assets, litigation or jurisdictions that don’t contribute to the bottom line.</p>
<h4 id=""cash-management"">Cash management</h4>
<p>Private equity ownership brings a whole new angle to balance sheet efficiency that transforms cash management and working capital at a cultural, strategic, and operational level. It results in a heightened emphasis on cash and pressure on treasury to improve cash forecasting, generation and return. The cash buffers that provide comfort to many listed companies’ balance sheets are quickly optimised, often replaced with a revolving credit facility to fund operations, says Membrillera. “We see this across the board.” Fleming recalls that Debenhams cash profit and cash reporting strategy released £103m in working capital in the company’s first year under private equity ownership.</p>
<h4 id=""debt"">Debt</h4>
<p>Effective cash management opens the door to another key characteristic of private equity. Private equity investors deliberately favour robust, operational, cash flows because they allow the highest levels of financial risk. “If you have robust cash flows you can better leverage the business,” explains Fleming. “Strong cash flows allow for greater financial engineering.”</p>
<p>Cue adjustments and optimisation of the relationship between debt and equity, all spurred on by tax breaks – like the ability to offset the cost of debt against the company’s tax burden – today’s low borrowing costs and using assets as collateral. “When interest rates are low there is an incentive to raise more debt than equity,” says Clive Black, a director at investment group Shore Capital. “Private equity investors are after the maximum internal rate of return. By injecting debt into the financial equation rather than just being equity funded, they can get a higher return on invested capital.”</p>
<p>Treasury becomes responsible for ensuring that the operating company can service the debt and managing the relationships with debt providers. Treasury will provide updates and rigour around communication, understand how the assets support the level of debt and be across ongoing debt refinancing of the initial take-out financing, repayment, and solvency ratios.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>And now the added risk of rising borrowing costs is also in the mix, warns Black, who argues that today’s private equity’s tailwind is linked more to low interest rates and central bank largesse than investor talent and corporate entrepreneurship. “No doubt, as interest rates rise, we are going to see poorer investment decision and the risk of debt and leverage come to the fore.”</p>
<p>Fleming also notes that for companies with an international footprint and revenues, treasury teams will often match the debt financing currency with the currency of its net inflows. “This can often create an overlay of hedging complexity not previously experienced or understood by management,” he says.</p>
<p>The focus on cash and a strong cash control function often manifests in private equity investors having little enthusiasm for best practice. Providing more colour from his days at Debenhams, Fleming observes demand for treasury systems and process improvements was capped at robust, fit-for-purpose frameworks only. “Why invest £100,000 in a new TMS when you can invest in something else with an IRR of 25%?” he asks.</p>
<h4 id=""hands-on"">Hands-on</h4>
<p>Treasury teams won’t have to get involved in public reporting anymore but they should expect a new, proactive kind of governance shaped by strong board views on strategy that bring strategic, operational and personnel change. “It’s nothing short of revolutionary,” says Membrillera. Treasury in a listed company is one step removed from shareholders, and governance is balanced between executive and non-executive directors: shareholders don’t ask to see management accounts and represent permanent capital, unlike private equity, where the joke goes, managers walk in backwards because they are looking to the exit.</p>
<p>Listed companies comprise a diverse group of stakeholders including activist investors seeking change but also passive investors tracking an index or those just wanting yield and a steady dividend rather than bells and whistles restructuring. This diverse stakeholder base means public companies often face resistance to close stores, move manufacturing facilities or consolidate business lines.</p>
<p>In contrast, private equity has much more freedom to support a company through a transition. It means treasury teams under private equity ownership are frequently called on to accelerate strategies that were impossible when the company was listed. It could be around a significant capex programme, revamping operational logistics, opening new sales lines, or refurbishing stores, all requiring capital and leverage.</p>
<h4 id=""bank-revamp"">Bank revamp</h4>
<p>Private equity ownership can trigger changes in banking relationships. On one hand, large companies taken private with solid and deep banking relationships will likely keep those ties. Yet new banks coming in to finance the acquisition will also remain in the relationship going forward, and in most cases, private equity’s own corporate teams design the initial financing. It leaves treasury teams with a pre-set financing package to manage including complex debt structures within a leveraged business.</p>
<p>Similarly, middle-range banking partners of a listed entity are often hoofed out by global players with more experience around securitisation or asset backed lending, who will then scoop up the ancillary business. “For example,” says Membrillera, “a suite of regional Italian banks with long-dated and deep ties to an Italian company taken private may be displaced by large global financial institutions.”</p>
<p>Still, it is not always the case. When the <a href=""/perspectives/profiles/corporate-view-mark-hirst-dr-martens-ttcv"">new treasurer of recently re-listed shoemaker Dr. Martens</a> began exploring the bank relationships spilling over from the company’s days under Permira’s private equity ownership, he unearthed a surprisingly long list of banks: some he’d never dealt with before; a handful outside the UK and one private equity-owned lender.</p>
<p>The specialist skills and relentless pace required of treasury under private equity ownership has led to a spike in demand for service providers. Treasury skills in the mid cap space, a rich hunting ground for private equity firms and where companies often lack a treasury operation or specialism and everything is done by the CFO, are in demand. Skills like re-listing for example, an ordeal at Debenhams that Fleming recalls as one of the most challenging periods of his career. “Any one of the three main work streams related to the exit strategy (IPO, IAS adoption and a refinancing) would be challenging but all together, it was hard work!”</p>
<p>This is made easier, perhaps, by a final key characteristic of private equity and consequence of the employee mentality of old getting binned in favour of one of ownership: treasury and the finance team can expect much more generous compensation. “A Management Equity Plan will generally be more generous than the typical stock options of a listed company. The bad news is, in some cases, they will have to work much harder,” concludes Membrillera.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>In a globalised world where value-creation counts, M&amp;A deals are big news. Opportunities abound yet they are potentially complex and resource-intensive, with no guarantee of success. We explore the role that treasurers have in managing the risks and opportunities pre- and post-deal.</em></p>
<p>The current market buoyancy for M&amp;A deals is a result of increased opportunity and confidence in the global markets. With stock markets performing well, valuations are on the rise. Yet according to EY’s Global Vice Chair of Transaction Advisory Services, Steve Krouskos, 2019’s global M&amp;A market “is expected to remain at elevated levels while the imperative to manage emerging opportunities and risks boosts M&amp;A appetite”.</p>
<p>Indeed, he says in EY’s Global Capital Confidence Barometer that, in an age of transformation, “buying rather than building can unlock future value creation at speed”. His report notes too that “competitive dynamics as they relate to technology and globalisation make M&amp;A more of an imperative than an option” and that companies are “embracing uncertainty rather than being unsettled by it”.</p>
<p>With strategic thinking around competitive advantage, and future market share front of mind (often to access new customers or geographies, to leverage new IP or brand value, or to secure operational advantages), Krouskos further records that executives are expecting to see many peers “targeting the right asset at the right time”. He also notes that, in many cases, “the right asset is the same asset”. M&amp;A competition, it seems, is intensifying.</p>
<h4 id=""strategic-input"">Strategic input</h4>
<p>The competitive nature of M&amp;A means getting the details of the deal right first time is vital for success. However, the definition of ‘successful deal’ is subjective, notes Dino Nicolaides, MD, Head of Treasury Advisory UK &amp; Ireland, Redbridge Debt &amp; Treasury Advisory.</p>
<p>“In my view, it must deliver the strategic, commercial or operational benefit anticipated at the outset. Under no circumstances should the return on capital (ROC) be below the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), simply because that would mean the deal has failed to add value.”</p>
<p>Thus, there is a huge expectation to perform in this respect, and the role of the treasurer in supporting a successful deal has never been more important. Indeed, treasurers, notes Nicolaides, have often been involved in ensuring the swift unlocking of the value of new acquisitions.</p>
<p>This means they will, for example, use their cash, capital markets and FX levers (that are, ideally, already finely-tuned within their own organisation) to ensure there are no impediments when integrating the financial operations of the new organisation.</p>
<p>However, even earlier and more upfront involvement is clearly essential to bring about value-adding success, not least, for example, with regard to optimising the structuring and management of any debt raised for a deal. With M&amp;A movements, the treasurer has genuine strategic importance, with the role being far more aligned with the broader objectives of successful activity in this field.</p>
<h4 id=""ready"">Ready?</h4>
<p>So how ready is treasury to provide the essential data and analysis? “The biggest test in this respect is whether they are meeting all of the CFOs needs, even without the looming idea of an acquisition,” says Bob Stark, VP of Strategy at Kyriba.</p>
<p>This, he explains, not only means ensuring currency operations are finely tuned, but also making sure cash forecasts are efficient from a cash flow perspective. It also means making sure there are no concerns around the efficiency of cash and liquidity structures; that there are no questions around the capital markets composition, nor around the ability of the business to use these levers to unlock further cash and liquidity to facilitate acquisitions.</p>
<p>Only when treasury is meeting the CFO’s evolving needs and supporting the CEO and board in their financial strategies, Stark says that is when the function is best placed to take a seat at the table, “offering credible opinions in terms of the value of potential acquisitions”.</p>
<h4 id=""avoiding-the-fx-trap"">Avoiding the FX trap</h4>
<p>One area of particular M&amp;A concern today is the FX side of a deal, says Stark. “With today’s currency volatility, it is not just the purchase price that can be affected by movement; it can also impact the unlocking of value within the acquired entity itself,” he warns.</p>
<p>Businesses are facing increased market volatility and, as they compete for the right deals, they are also acquiring in new geographies, so potentially dealing with new operating currencies too. This combination creates the perfect ‘FX storm’.</p>
<p>“Treasury has a keen understanding of the impact of currency movements on the balance sheet and cash flows, and is well-positioned to identify opportunities that may arise too,” suggests Stark. In practice, treasury knowledge could even give rise to an adjustment of the purchase price or the financing of the deal, and is likely to inform the putting on of appropriate hedges earlier in the process to ensure that risk is mitigated.</p>
<p>This is important. A sudden unprotected FX spike in the wrong direction can prove costly at closure, not just on price but also on the entire composition of the balance sheet. “Currency volatility can completely change the value of an acquisition,” warns Stark. “This can be true even when acquiring in the same currency if the acquired enterprise has a significant FX component through its operations.”</p>
<p>It should be clear then that the treasurer’s earliest involvement in an acquisition is crucial to ensure that the deal is not exposed to a sudden loss of value. It is manifestly suboptimal if treasury is only able to understand what the business is exposed to after the fact. For the deal to be a success, treasury needs to know upfront how the balance sheet and P&amp;L changes, what the cash flow statement looks like globally, what hedges are on or off, and even just the general liquidity structure of the acquired business.</p>
<h4 id=""understanding-deals"">Understanding deals</h4>
<p>Understanding the full financial position of the target company going into a deal means treasury is able to prepare the ground for a quick and efficient integration – and any remedial action – if that deal concludes successfully.</p>
<p>Stark argues powerfully that success should not be compromised in any way by something as fundamental as currency exposures. This is why, increasingly, treasurers are invited to take up a seat at the table, not just as part of an operational M&amp;A team ensuring a specific deal is executed, but also as a key part of the evaluation process of opportunities and potential deals.</p>
<h4 id=""pre-deal"">Pre-deal</h4>
<p>Assuming treasury readiness, there is a pre-deal advisory element for treasurers that arises even before a target has been identified, says Didier Philouze, MD, Global Head of Debt Advisory, Redbridge Debt &amp; Treasury Advisory. Treasurers need to analyse the impact of any new strategic change of direction, including any move towards M&amp;A or significant growth, he says.</p>
<p>“If management wants to double the size of the business through multiple acquisitions, clearly this could have a meaningful impact on the way the business generates profits, the volatility of its cash flows and on its credit profile. It could also have an impact on its liquidity requirements,” warns Philouze. “If treasury is to have a say in the way M&amp;A is managed, it needs to offer a clear view of the financial effects of the deal; without that view, the business could make a huge mistake in its M&amp;A model in terms of debt quantum or cost of debt.”</p>


<blockquote><p>Being data-driven is the reality now, and for treasury, it’s about understanding how it can build more bridges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">Bob Stark, VP of Strategy, Kyriba</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The treasurer’s financial analysis, presented to and discussed with the CFO and CEO, should confirm that they fully understand what could be at stake, in terms of, for example, the company’s equity requirements or maximum debt capacity, and especially regarding the timing and sequence of any acquisition.</p>
<p>It may transpire that pre-funding the deal is advantageous. In this instance, part of the financing is secured ahead of the transaction. This gives a bid greater credibility whilst avoiding the need, should progress be unexpectedly rapid, for expensive bridging facilities.</p>
<p>However, if in its analysis, treasury sees evidence that a proposed deal leads to a significant negative effect on key aspects such as credit ratings or covenants, or that it demands that borrowings are ramped up substantially, the pressure these issues add to the acquiring company’s existing exposures to credit markets, interest rates and FX, may suggest that the deal is not right and that management should reconsider.</p>
<p>Says Stark: “With its exceptional skillset of understanding capital markets and cash flows, its ability to unlock capital, and to manage currency volatility, treasury is in a unique position to add intelligence capable of demonstrating the value or otherwise of a deal.”</p>
<h4 id=""deal-time"">Deal time</h4>
<p>A pre-financed M&amp;A deal will reduce the treasurer’s stress levels, says Philouze. But if not in place, and there is an investment bank mandated on the acquisition finance, then he says treasury may play an important role in ensuring that what is being negotiated with that bank is competitive, compatible with the acquiring corporate’s existing financial structure, and will not be overly complicated to manage post-deal.</p>
<p>In one illustration of the latter, Philouze cites a business where the T&amp;Cs of a facility, arranged without CFO and treasury input, ring-fenced the US cash flows of the acquired business, limiting the immediate benefits of the financial integration of the acquisition.</p>
<p>Worse still, the terms did not permit any new debt to be raised in other parts of the group before the reimbursement of the acquisition finance put in place in the US. “It shows big mistakes can be made without treasury involvement,” he comments.</p>
<p>The reason for calling upon the treasurer is simple. “When an investment bank is mandated for M&amp;A, financing is just a side-product,” explains Philouze. “For the bank, the priority is to secure the execution of the M&amp;A and ensure the financing does not become a problem in that process; it has little interest in trying to optimise the financing that is being put in place. It is the role of the treasurer to have a say in the way new financing will be structured and put in place.”</p>
<p>From the moment a deal is struck, to the completion of the deal, the treasurer needs to take account of what needs to be put into place so that on day one, business can run as usual, adds Nicolaides.</p>
<p>“This notion is even more valid during a carve-out because sometimes if a small subsidiary or business unit is acquired, it will most likely not have its own treasury function,” he notes. “One will have to be put into place as soon as possible to enable continuity, and that requires planning.”</p>
<p>As an additional hurdle, where bank facilities and lines of credit are withdrawn from the acquired business, because they belong to the previous owner, the treasurer of the acquiring entity needs to get out there and start negotiating, making sure the relevant lines and facilities are in place for the acquired. And with each organisation having its own risk appetite, the treasurer also needs to consider how to adapt the newly acquired organisation to this.</p>
<h4 id=""post-deal"">Post-deal</h4>
<p>Treasury planning should come to fruition post-deal. The to-do list might include operational integration, risk management policies, people and skills, amendments to the overall governance structure if the acquisition is sizeable (the need for treasury committees and sub-committees, for example), reporting processes between the acquired and treasury HQ, and of course systems and technology.</p>
<p>‘The first 100 days’, as the experience is often known, is a vital part of post-deal transitioning. In reality, this period can extend much longer than this and it may be that only six months later is the treasurer finally in a position to rationalise the business and, for example, deal with the two treasury centres that exist in the same country.</p>
<p>Treasury needs to consider its geographical footprint and start tackling structure sooner rather than later. But it is also important, from a strategic perspective, not to just think about what has been ‘inherited’, but also to review why the acquisition happened, and what the strategic objectives are, before adapting the longer-term outlook of treasury.</p>
<p>One further aspect with great importance is communication with the ratings agencies, says Philouze, especially where treasury has highlighted a potential impact by the deal on the credit profile of the acquiring company.</p>
<p>During the transaction, the acquiring business will have undertaken a lot of work to show the best credit story possible to the rating agency and the lenders. Now, post-deal, these relationships need to be managed, ensuring all stakeholders understand the benefits of that deal.</p>
<p>Post-deal, the existing debt of the target and the combined debt profile, may require restructuring by treasury. This may see centralisation of debt, but will certainly require action in terms of currency, maturity profiles and hedging. “Treasury may be looking at a lot of work to re-optimise its book of currency swaps and debt location,” cautions Philouze.</p>

<p>Of course, having treasury rooted on an island is never the most effective model. To be able to assist the organisation in the successful conclusion of the right deals, it must collaborate and, to an extent, integrate with other functions, allowing the smooth exchange of data. Few now would fail to recognise the increasing importance of technology in achieving this aim.</p>
<p>There is a basic requirement in any acquisition for treasury’s collaboration with other parts of the organisation to ensure support of a host of activities, from the supply chain and working capital, to cash flow and payments. But the necessity for treasury to be able to support the rapid and effective integration of acquisitions and larger scale mergers is most pressing.</p>
<p>If this is to happen, technologies from both sides of the deal must be able to communicate, says Stark. To be truly efficient requires what he calls a “holistic approach”, in effect, creating a “treasury enterprise system”.</p>
<p>The holistic approach he espouses provides an opportunity for treasurers to extract the intelligence and value that may be derived from a newly enlarged enterprise-wide pool of data. “The technology exists to do this; it’s now a matter of having the connectivity and processes in place,” he advises.</p>
<h4 id=""advantage-treasury"">Advantage treasury</h4>
<p>From the point of view of treasury’s involvement in M&amp;A, “proactivity is the key”, advises Stark. “Being data-driven is the reality now, and for treasury, it’s about understanding how it can build more bridges.”</p>
<p>Nicolaides concurs, believing treasury’s involvement should start way before closure. “Initially, it is important for the treasurer to educate the CFO and CEO on what value treasury can add in this situation,” he says. “If they leave this until the transaction is well-underway, the time pressure of the deal means many aspects could be missed, with the CFO and CEO not realising that the treasurer is a key individual to have involved.”</p>
<p>But it is incumbent upon the treasurer to step beyond the role of ‘technical guru’, and begin thinking more commercially and strategically. It’s essential to explain complex treasury issues in non-technical language, so that all stakeholders within the M&amp;A are successfully on-board and up to speed.</p>
<p>Taking the proactive stance, where the debt and credit profiles, pre-funding plans and integration tactics have already been worked on, should resonate with the CEO, not least because preparation could deliver huge savings.</p>
<p>More importantly, treasury’s early involvement indicates maximum credibility and financial firepower for the bid, says Philouze. “It allows the acquiring team to enter the process with a very assertive message to the sellers that they mean business.” In this highly competitive arena then, it may well be treasury who brings the deal home.</p>


","In a globalised world where value-creation counts, M&A deals are big news. Opportunities abound yet they are potentially complex and resource-intensive, with no guarantee of success. We explore the role that treasurers have in managing the risks and opportunities pre- and post-deal.",https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/funding-and-investing/alternative-investments/2019-09-10-tt-07-cm__business-leadership-teamwork-power-confidence-concept-574544962__1920x1080.jpg,2019-09-01,Alternative Funding,False

<p>Asset based lending (ABL), was previously viewed as a last resort for troubled businesses needing a quick cash injection. The last few years have seen this perception change with ABL now growing in popularity, and being used more and more by healthy and successful businesses looking to secure lending against its “borrowing base” rather than on a cash flow basis.</p>
<p>A business’ borrowing base can be very broad, which opens up opportunities for businesses to secure lending across a large scope of assets. The assets included in a borrowing base are deal specific, but lenders usually include some or all of working capital (accounts receivable and inventory), machinery and equipment, property and other intangible assets. The broad range of assets that can be incorporated means that there are various forms of ABL, with the type of facility being tailored to fit the needs of each particular business. Typically, funding is made against receivables and inventory, and thus ABL is seen very much as a working capital solution.</p>
<p>Invoice discounting is the most common form of ABL in use and involves the funder acquiring, at discount, a business’ receivables. It can be implemented on either a confidential (so the end debtor does not get notified) or disclosed (where the end debtor is) basis. Confidential invoice discounting is invisible to the customer with the business still managing its client relationships. Alternatively, the business could be happy to outsource all the debt collection to the funder as well – with this solution more commonly known as factoring. This approach is more typically focussed on SMEs, who don’t have the resources to run significant finance collection teams.</p>
<p>As well as addressing working capital, ABL can assist businesses in acquisitive behaviour, refinancing and restructuring or simply as a “safe” method of lending more. For a bank lender, the asset-backed nature of the lend makes it, absent fraud, less likely to produce a loss upon default; this leads to a lower internal capital cost and, accordingly, more attractive pricing to a corporate. The potential downside to a corporate is that there is more administration in running such a facility. However, having suitable controls and monitoring over the working capital and assets is never a bad thing, and a number of corporates have subsequently commented that their internal financial visibility has increased. The documentation required when setting up an invoice discounting facility is quite simple, as there are bank standard forms which can be signed very quickly. However, where there is a more bespoke ABL solution being put in place, the documentation process can be quite long and intensive.</p>
<p>How does it work? The ABL funder applies a static advance rate against a class of assets (ranging from 50% on inventory, to 90% against receivables). This provides a flexible credit line that expands and contracts in line with a business’ borrowing base, and is particularly suited to asset-rich businesses that are also growing, cyclical, seasonal, volatile and/or low margin. A huge draw to ABL is its ability to close the funding gap between a business issuing an invoice and being paid. After the business issues a client invoice, the funder will advance the business a percentage of the invoice value. This provides the business with an immediate injection of capital, instead of the business encountering a gap between issuing and payment.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Undoubtedly asset-based lending (ABL) has evolved into a more widely used debt product. In the UK, for instance, more companies are turning to ABL to support their working capital needs and overall growth, whether organic or through acquisition.</p>
<p>In fact, the Asset-based Finance Association (ABFA) reported earlier this year that the amount of asset-based financing secured by UK businesses against stock increased 22% from 2014 to 2015, with an uptick in the number of large businesses taking advantage of ABL.</p>
<p>From a sector perspective, at Wells Fargo Capital Finance we continue to see strong interest in ABL within retail, distribution, equipment rental, and manufacturing. We’ve also found opportunities to deliver flexible senior secured funding options to businesses in less traditional sectors, such as professional services and technology. Additionally, we’ve had great success working with private equity firms to support their acquisitions and the ongoing working capital needs of their portfolio companies.</p>
<p>However, despite a steady rise in the use of ABL, there still remains some lack of awareness and a historic reputation as lender of last resort.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while ABL has traditionally been viewed as an alternative to traditional financing, many companies that would qualify for traditional bank financing may prefer ABL based on a number of factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Flexibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved liquidity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strong relationship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creditworthiness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Syndication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complementary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speed of decision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Covenants.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether the future business requirement is short-term working capital funding or acquisition debt to support long-term growth, ABL is a viable and flexible option that can help companies of varying sizes.</p>
<p>ABL is therefore a funding solution that is often overlooked by businesses due to dated negative connotations, when it can in fact provide flexible financing more suited to the needs of a business than that of a cash flow based facility.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Asset based lending (ABL) is a bespoke and flexible funding solution which allows a borrower to release fully secured debt funding against a variety of assets in its balance sheet. Typically, an ABL facility will comprise of revolving credit facilities secured against a borrower’s eligible receivables and inventory, together with repaying term loan facilities provided against property and plant and machinery.</p>
<p>Given the fully asset-secured nature of the facilities, lenders are often able to maximise a borrower’s debt capacity beyond other forms of debt structures, and allow for greater degrees of leverage, all at reduced lending margins.</p>
<p>Mainstream ABL lenders are able to enhance the core ABL debt structure with additional trade and ancillary facilities, thus providing end-to-end working capital solutions with associated interest rate and currency hedging instruments in support.</p>
<p>Asset-based lending can be a much-needed source of capital for companies that face a range of needs including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refinancing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restructure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mergers and acquisitions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Management buyouts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ABL protects equity in the business by leveraging assets more effectively, allowing firms to raise significant funds without sacrificing equity. It offers a lot of flexibility as it can increase or decrease with changes in the funding base and can be useful for businesses that face seasonal peaks or industry cycles where other sources of funding may be too inflexible to meet spikes in working capital.</p>
<p>It can be used as part of a wider funding package to improve working capital and support growth plans and is also popular because it can offer lower funding costs than traditional funding methods, whilst releasing significantly more capital.</p>
<p>There are very few downsides. ABL borrowers are likely to be required to provide more comprehensive management information to lenders in order to evidence the collateral securing the facility. However, this tends to become largely routine for ABL borrowers and, given the lender’s focus on the performance of working capital assets, these reporting obligations can frequently represent an opportunity for borrowers to understand the shortcomings and opportunities in better-managing their working capital cycle.</p>
<p>ABL is therefore an extremely effective tool which unlocks the capital tied up in a business’ balance sheet and is a product that helps support its working capital. It is best suited to businesses that have asset-heavy balance sheets and is typically popular amongst businesses involved in the manufacturing, services, wholesale and distribution sectors. It can accommodate any level of debt requirement, with facilities provided to relatively modest SMEs through to larger, more complex structures including syndicated, multi-national, multi-currency and multi-asset facilities.</p>
<p>Today, it is being used by businesses to support a range of circumstances in order to support their business ambitions. Used alongside other working capital products, including trade, receivables, purchase and asset finance, ABL can open the door to new opportunities for businesses and help them prosper.</p>

Commercial cards – the global landscape,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Commercial cards are used around the world but what sets some markets apart from others are differing levels of maturity and product sophistication. While the North American commercial cards' market is the largest and most developed, there are some interesting variations in usage in different regions of the world. In this article we look at some of these differences and consider how the commercial cards' market is likely to develop.</p>
<h3 id=""types-of-card-available"">Types of card available</h3>
<p>The term ‘commercial cards’ covers corporate credit cards, purchasing cards, pre.paid cards (including fuel cards/fleet cards) and commercial debit cards. There are literally thousands of variants of commercial card products in existence around the world, with new ones being introduced all the time.</p>
<p>Here is a brief look at the main types of commercial cards and the benefits they offer.</p>
<h4 id=""corporate-credit-cards"">Corporate credit cards</h4>
<p>Corporate credit/charge cards are commonplace in the world of business. They were the first commercial card product to be launched and are found in more markets than any other type of card.</p>
<p>Companies need to have a cost-effective means of tracking and controlling the business-related expenses of their employees. By issuing corporate charge cards to employees, in conjunction with a clear expenses policy, the companies which issue them are able to gain a good level of control over travel and entertainment (T&amp;E) expenses. It is then easy to monitor the volume of T&amp;E spend by individuals or departments, to ensure that company money is spent with suitable ‘partners’ and to monitor any abuse of the system.</p>
<p>The advantages for corporate clients are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Better ability to manage costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduction in processing and administration costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Greater transparency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Better data availability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced risk of theft or fraud.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=""purchasing-cards"">Purchasing cards</h4>
<p>Purchasing cards (P-cards) have been around since the 1980s and are essentially a type of company charge card – one that is specifically used for the procurement of low value non travel-related goods and services. Typically these include things like equipment, materials and office supplies. They allow purchasing transactions to be done more cost effectively than traditional methods involving cheques and are particularly popular with government organisations. As with corporate credit cards, the principal driver for the entity issuing them to employees is cost savings resulting from the elimination of manual processes.</p>
<p>The US government is a major user of P-cards and in the UK Visa Europe’s Government Procurement Card (GPC Visa) has more than 1,700 programmes. According to Visa’s website GPC Visa “generated annual efficiency savings of £186m across the UK public sector” in 2009.</p>
<h4 id=""prepaid-commercial-cards"">Prepaid commercial cards</h4>
<p>Prepaid cards were originally introduced into the market as gift cards for consumers. These are cards which are pre-loaded with a fixed amount of credit. They can be disposable – ie used until the funds on the card are used up and then thrown away, or re-loadable – ie when the value on the card is running low it can be topped up and used again.</p>
<p>Other types of prepaid cards offered by banks and retailers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Youth cards</h5>
<p>– which allow young people (and their parents) to monitor and control spending.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Travel cards</h5>
<p>– a safer alternative to carrying cash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Gift cards</h5>
<p>– an alternative to cash or vouchers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Virtual cards</h5>
<p>– for online purchases or purchases by telephone/mail order.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While the use of these cards is still more prevalent in the consumer sector, their adoption by the commercial sector is expanding rapidly – their potential is enormous, particularly for governments, where they can be used to replace high cost, inefficient paper-based methods to distribute unemployment benefits, child support and disaster relief funds.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the recent floods which devastated Pakistan the country’s identification agency, Nadra, worked with Visa and a local bank to issue over a million prepaid cards. These government-funded cards were each loaded with PKR 20,000 (about €166) and distributed to citizens of Pakistan whose lives had been severely impacted by the floods. The chairman of Nadra stated that “electronic payments are the future for aid disbursement.”</p>
<p>In the corporate arena, meanwhile, the range of applications includes salary payments for unbanked employees, incentive payments and expenses.</p>
<h4 id=""commercial-debit-cards"">Commercial debit cards</h4>
<p>Commercial debit cards (or business debit cards) are similar to personal debit cards, except that they are aimed at business users. They are linked to the deposit account of the business and are particularly popular with small businesses. They offer a convenient way for business users to pay bills, draw cash at ATMs and track business expenditure.</p>
<p>This is a category of commercial card which is growing strongly in some markets but has not taken hold in others. In the US less than 50% of small business current accounts have business debit cards.</p>
<h3 id=""what-are-the-disadvantages"">What are the disadvantages?</h3>
<p>While the growth of commercial card transaction volumes and types of usage in recent years have benefitted banks, corporates and individual users, not all parties involved in commercial card transactions appear to be happy with the arrangements. A common view among merchants is that the cost of accepting commercial card transactions is too high. The interchange on commercial cards is often set at a higher level than for consumer cards, which are already viewed by the merchant community as being too high. There are moves in some markets to pass legislation which would place limits on interchange fees.</p>
<p>Another problem, which particularly affects commercial debit cards, is fraud. Despite stronger security measures being implemented by card issuers, such as Chip and PIN, the problem of card fraud does not seem to be going away.</p>
<h3 id=""global-variations-in-commercial-card-use"">Global variations in commercial card use</h3>
<p>In this section we look at some of the regional differences in commercial card usage:</p>
<h4 id=""north-america"">North America</h4>
<p>The North American (US/Canadian) commercial cards market is the most mature. In both countries a wide range of commercial card products is available. The US government and the Canadian government both make extensive use of these products. In the case of the US government, it first started using bank commercial card technology back in the 1980s in order to streamline the way goods and services were purchased and to reduce costs. Prepaid cards and debit cards have been growing at a healthy rate in both markets.</p>
<h4 id=""europe"">Europe</h4>
<p>In Europe the UK commercial cards market is seen as the most developed. It has the second largest government card programme in the world, after the US. There is a wide range of products available, particularly corporate cards, centralised travel cards and fleet cards, and a large number of suppliers. Purchasing cards are growing in popularity. There is also likely to be growth in UK government use of prepaid cards, driven by the requirement to disburse benefits in the most efficient and cost-effective way. This is particularly important in view of the UK government’s need to cut the national deficit by all available means. The use of business debit cards in the UK is still limited and is seen as a growth area.</p>
<p>In continental Europe the picture is somewhat different. About two-thirds of companies in Europe use corporate cards but this only accounts for around 3% of total spend.</p>
<p>Many markets have sophisticated and relatively low cost electronic transfer systems. These are used to facilitate all types of payments and are extensively used by businesses. In Germany, for example, the payments’ market for both commercial and retail payments is highly efficient and automated. Payments using commercial cards have hitherto not played a major role.</p>
<p>The use of prepaid cards is growing in Europe. The governments of countries such as Italy and Romania are looking to use them for benefits disbursements. MasterCard research suggests that the value of the European ‘open loop’ prepaid card market will see an average annual increase of 26% between now and 2017. The same research also expects the rollout of prepaid cards by corporates to grow rapidly. Perhaps surprisingly the replacement of lunch vouchers with prepaid cards is expected to be a big factor in this growth.</p>

<h5 id=""open-loop-closed-loop"">Open loop/closed loop?</h5>
<p>Open loop cards are cards that are branded by MasterCard, Visa or another network. They can be used anywhere that accepts the network brand. In contrast, closed loop cards are specific to a certain retailer or group of retailers.</p>

<h4 id=""asia-pacific"">Asia-Pacific</h4>
<p>The Asia-Pacific region is very large and the development of the commercial cards sector differs widely from market to market. Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Singapore have well-developed markets. The Australian government, for example, has an extensive card programme. Hong Kong and Singapore host the regional headquarters of many multinationals, which often have traditional corporate card programmes in place. Penetration is lower for other products.</p>
<p>An increasing level of activity in the commercial cards market is being seen right across the region but particularly in Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia and India. In South Korea business debit cards are growing in popularity. China and India are of course the two big markets in the region. Both present significant opportunities for growth but each has particular challenges which will need to be overcome:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>India has huge numbers of small and medium-sized businesses which deal largely in cash. A large percentage of its population is also unbanked. Issuers in India, mainly commercial banks, have been looking at overcoming the infrastructural issues and finding new ways to serve business enterprises. Purchasing cards are seeing growth, as are prepaid cards, which are increasingly popular in the form of payroll cards and travel cards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like India, China remains a cash society. Most commercial payments are completed through interbank transfers but this still leaves a sizeable volume of payments for services such as travel which are paid for in cash. Foreign companies with a presence in China are driving the demand for a switch to commercial cards to make commercial payments. Given the vast size of the China market, growth is expected to be significant.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In both India and China, which have enormous government sectors, enabling government-to-business spend to be undertaken more efficiently is going to be a major area of focus for years to come.</p>
<h4 id=""latin-america"">Latin America</h4>
<p>Brazil and Mexico are the two largest and most developed markets in Latin America, but in outright terms card usage remains low in comparison with more developed markets. Increasing volumes of electronic payments are, however, being seen in the region as business users move away from cash – Visa Inc. reported 15.6% growth in commercial cards payments volume in the Latin America/Caribbean region in 2009. Regional volumes are being boosted by greater use of commercial credit cards and prepaid commercial cards by both SMEs and the public sector. Merchant acceptance is also playing a role in this growth. In Brazil merchant acceptance grew at a very healthy 18.6% in 2009.</p>
<p>Other markets in the region are still at the nascent stage of development but countries such as Argentina and Chile have well-developed consumer cards markets which will pave the way for future growth in commercial cards.</p>
<h4 id=""middle-east-and-africa"">Middle East and Africa</h4>
<p>The Middle East is seen as an area with considerable potential for growth in the commercial cards business, particularly in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Large numbers of foreign multinationals are present in these countries and there is a willingness among businesses in the region to embrace more efficient ways of handling commercial transactions.</p>
<p>In Africa, the principal market for commercial cards is South Africa, the continent’s most developed economy. Traditional corporate cards are the main product, but there is an expectation that the South African commercial cards market will grow.</p>
<h3 id=""commercial-cards-the-future"">Commercial cards – the future</h3>
<p>According to Marcie Verdin, Group Head and SVP Global Commercial Products at MasterCard Worldwide, “Increasing numbers of companies around the world are beginning to see the benefits of shifting from paper-based to electronic payments so we expect growth to remain strong. Packaged Facts (a well-known US publisher of market studies on consumer products) estimates the commercial payments segment will grow 10.8% over the next five years. There are various levels of market maturity around the world and the opportunities will vary depending on the country.</p>
<p>“In terms of product development, historically mature regions, including the US, Canada and the UK have driven most of the innovations, with emerging markets later adopting some of the solutions. What we are seeing now is that financial institutions in emerging markets are seeking tailored solutions that address local nuances rather than simply adapt existing offerings from others countries.”</p>
<h4 id=""beyond-plastic"">Beyond plastic</h4>
<p>Morten Kolind, Vice President of Swedbank Card Services commented that “In general the usage of international payments cards is increasing. This goes for both debit cards and credit cards, and for both personal and corporate customers. The development is to some extent technology-driven and the implementation of EMV-chip and PIN makes transactions more secure and thus more attractive to customers, merchants, issuers and acquirers. New features such as contactless cards and other contactless payment devices, rather than traditional plastic cards, will drive the usage of cards, including corporate cards, even further.”</p>
<p>Marcie Verdin broadly agrees: “There are emerging technologies that will change the way we look at commercial cards. For example, we think of a card as a piece of plastic, sitting in a wallet. However, a majority of commercial card transactions for large enterprises actually happen in a “plastic-free” environment. So, while plastic cards may go the way of the eight-track or cassette player, the future likely belongs to the virtual account, offering increased flexibility plus the benefits of a payment card.</p>
<p>“The value of the account number, the network of buyers and suppliers, and the information exchanged among all of the players in the ecosystem is unparalleled. The industry will continue to find new ways to harness this value and create compelling solutions to drive more spend on cards. By turning paper transactions into electronic ones companies can get better information and greater efficiency and transparency.”</p>
<h4 id=""green-reporting"">Green reporting</h4>
<p>There is common agreement that businesses will be focussing more closely in the future on carbon emissions from business travel and improving their sustainability. Card issuers are looking at how they can help their business clients in this area. American Express Commercial Cards, for example, have recently launched the Carbon Savings Account Manager (Carbon SAM), in Europe. This is an innovative service to help companies measure, track and reduce their business travel emissions at the touch of a button.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Fat fingers. Rogue traders. Data theft. Disgruntled employees. There are many ways in which an individual’s behaviour can threaten a company’s operations and damage its reputation. We discuss the different types of employee risk that a company may face and consider how these risks can be managed.</p>
<h3 id=""what-is-employee-risk"">What is employee risk?</h3>
<p>Put simply, the term employee risk covers all the things that a company employee can do, whether intended or not, which can damage the employer’s business in some way.</p>
<h4 id=""employee-risk-in-the-treasury"">Employee risk in the treasury</h4>
<p>The modern treasury is a highly complex work environment and the volumes of business transacted mean that when things do go wrong the impact will quickly become apparent, will sometimes be spectacular and can often be very costly. Human ingenuity is such that there is almost no limit to the types of damage that can be inflicted on an employer by an unhappy or misguided member of staff.</p>
<p>From the treasurer’s perspective, then, addressing employee risk is an important part of the managerial challenge. Although all well-managed treasuries will have policies and procedures in place which set out in considerable detail how key elements of risk are to be managed by the business, it is particularly difficult to cover all the bases when it comes to dealing with employee risk. This is due to the sheer number of forms that it can take. In some respects it is this surprise element which makes it a more difficult category of risk to manage than either FX or interest rate risk.</p>
<h3 id=""types-of-risk"">Types of risk</h3>
<h4 id=""rogue-trading"">Rogue trading</h4>
<p>Whenever the subject of employee risk is mentioned, ‘rogue trading’ is usually the first topic which comes to mind.</p>
<p>Over the years there have been many high profile cases, usually in the banking industry, where a rogue trader has, through a combination of bravado, bad decision-making, lax controls and lack of managerial supervision, caused an employer to lose very large amounts of money. For example, in 2008 Société Générale’s Jerome Kerviel lost his employer €4.9 billion.</p>
<p>Rogue trader cases are nearly always big news stories, and rightly so – rogue traders can cause serious reputational as well as financial damage to the company which employs them. They also tend to result in a lot of unwelcome scrutiny and questions from regulators.</p>
<p>Rogue trading is possibly the area of employee risk which concerns a treasurer the most, since it calls into question the treasurer’s ability to manage the business. Apart from the financial damage to the firm there is an embarrassment factor – no senior treasury manager wants to be associated with, let alone implicated, when the big investigation takes place into what went wrong. It is certainly not good for the CV.</p>
<p>For the most part though, well-run treasuries should be able to rely on their internal controls, along with effective management supervision, to prevent rogue trading. It is nevertheless important that treasurers keep in close touch with the ‘buzz’ on the trading floor – this may help to identify an ‘at risk’ trader. The individual who thinks he or she is smarter than the market and has found a way to sidestep an internal control usually says or does something which will give some small clue to colleagues as to what’s happening.</p>
<h4 id=""employee-fraud"">Employee fraud</h4>
<p>Employee-related fraud risk is something that all treasurers have to be mindful of. In tough economic times, where people’s job security may be under threat and where bonus levels are lower than in the good times, the potential for employee fraud tends to increase. Employees may well have made financial or lifestyle commitments in times of plenty, which they suddenly find themselves struggling to fulfil. Desperation to maintain a certain lifestyle regardless of an impending change in personal circumstances – combined with an opportunity to commit fraud – can lead people to cross the line.</p>
<p>Staff fraud comes in many forms, from straightforward theft, for example through submission of inflated expense claims, to opportunistic crimes where a procedural loophole or a weakness in the company’s systems is exploited for personal gain.</p>

<p>Analysis of ‘insider’ fraud cases by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners in the US reveals some interesting insights. The 2010 edition of their Global Fraud Report states that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The typical fraud goes on for 18 months before it is detected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insider fraud is more likely to be detected by a tip-off than by any other means.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smaller organisations are disproportionately targeted because they typically lack adequate controls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More than 85% of fraudsters have never previously been charged with or convicted of a fraud-related offence, making their activities even harder to detect.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>According to KPMG’s UK Fraud Barometer, 2009 saw ‘a dramatic increase in serious employee fraud’. Losses totalled an estimated £567m, the highest level since the barometer began 22 years ago.</p>
<h4 id=""theft-of-corporate-data"">Theft of corporate data</h4>
<p>The theft of confidential corporate data by employees is a sub-set of employee fraud, but it ranks as another big area of concern for treasurers. This type of fraud has the potential to inflict major reputational damage on the firm as well as damaging important client relationships.</p>
<p>In 2008 an employee of Countrywide Home Loans in California was found to have been downloading information on around 20,000 customers a week onto USB devices over a two year period. He sold each batch of customer information to a third party for $500. Clearly this was not good for Countrywide’s business or for their reputation. The fraud could probably have been prevented if the company had had better monitoring controls in place over what information was being downloaded by employees onto external devices.</p>
<p>The sheer number of cases of corporate data theft reported in the media does seem to suggest that this type of fraud is particularly difficult to prevent. If employees need to have company data on their PCs, BlackBerrys and other portable devices in order to do their jobs effectively, it is inevitable that sooner or later a company laptop will be left on a train or a plane. Companies need to have policies and procedures in place to deal with data theft or data loss, both in terms of rendering the information useless to the finder and managing any negative PR fallout. No treasurer would wish to see details of major client trading positions and pricing, lists of staff bonuses or sensitive internal memos posted on the web for the whole world to see.</p>
<h4 id=""human-error"">Human error</h4>
<p>Despite all of the technology used in stock markets and company treasuries to check, analyse and if necessary block trades input by humans, errors still occur and these can prove very costly.</p>
<p>In 2005 a ‘fat-finger’ keyboard error by a junior employee on the dealing floor of Mizuho Securities in Japan ultimately led to the resignation of the Head of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). The TSE’s trading system failed to block a sell order for 610,000 shares in a manpower recruitment firm at JPY1 apiece – the trader had actually intended to sell one share in the firm at JPY 610,000. The firm only had 14,500 outstanding shares, so the sell order was over 40 times larger than this. Confidence in the TSE had been undermined by its failure to spot the erroneous trade and it was this which cost the TSE Head his job.</p>
<p>For Mizuho, which was forced to buy back the shares at a higher price, the incident cost the equivalent of three months’ net profit. All end of year bonuses in the securities division were cancelled as a result.</p>
<p>The following year, a $50m trade was executed earlier than planned when a rugby ball landed on the keyboard of a Bank of America trader. The trade had been set up to execute when the trader pressed enter.</p>
<h3 id=""mundane-yes-but-still-potentially-damaging"">Mundane, yes, but still potentially damaging</h3>
<p>While rogue traders, employee fraud cases and fat-finger errors tend to grab the headlines there are other types of employee risk which can also lead to serious financial loss or reputational damage.</p>
<p>Some of these are somewhat mundane but their impact should not be underestimated:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Loss of key personnel</h5>
<p>can be highly disruptive where the business has become over-reliant on a handful of key individuals and these people (or teams) are poached by competitors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Short-term absenteeism</h5>
<p>is a fact of life in most treasuries. As long as the company has made a reasonable effort at multi-skilling and cross-training its workforce it is usually not too difficult to manage this risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Longer-term absenteeism</h5>
<p>whether planned for or not, can be more difficult to deal with – particularly where key personnel are concerned. With key personnel absent for prolonged periods, the level of operational risk within the business tends to increase.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""workplace-environment"">Workplace environment</h3>
<p>Regardless of the size of a corporate treasury team, it is often challenging to keep all members of the team 100% motivated and focused all of the time. The workplace is a complex environment. The actions of egotistical bosses can result in a poor working environment, with undesirable workplace behaviours such as favouritism and bullying. These in turn can give rise to jealousies, rivalries and disputes, all of which can cause employees to do things which may damage the company.</p>
<p>Let’s consider what can happen when an employee feels so wronged by an employer or a boss that he decides to seek revenge…</p>
<h4 id=""the-disgruntled-employee"">The disgruntled employee</h4>
<p>It is not at all unusual for an employee who, for example, has been passed over for promotion or who has had a poor bonus, to feel some anger or a sense of frustration. Even more dangerous is the employee who thinks, or knows, that redundancy is looming.</p>
<p>For the most part, employees who are experiencing extremely negative feelings towards the company or other employees will drown their sorrows in a bar, however, some may be motivated to seek revenge on their company, or their boss, and will want to inflict maximum damage as they depart.</p>
<p>Treasurers always need to be vigilant, looking out for the disgruntled employee who has the capacity to inflict serious damage on the company in an act of revenge – the IT Support person who could cause a systems crash, perhaps, or the corporate finance executive in possession of sensitive information which could wreck a deal.</p>
<h4 id=""sexual-harassment"">Sexual harassment</h4>
<p>The high octane environment in a corporate treasury, with well-educated, ambitious people working long hours in close proximity, can be fertile ground for cases of sexual harassment. It sometimes seems that hardly a month goes by without such a case in the corporate world. These have the capacity to be both high profile and damaging to the employer. Unfortunately they are also very difficult either to predict or to prevent.</p>
<p>In recent years there has been a marked trend towards lower tolerance of ‘inappropriate relationships’ involving corporate bosses. Higher standards of behaviour are expected of employees, particularly senior ones. Mark Hurd, the CEO of Hewlett-Packard was recently ousted from his job over such a case. This caused HP’s stock market valuation to plummet – the company lost $13 billion at one point – a clear indication that the stakes can sometimes be very high.</p>
<h3 id=""can-employee-risk-be-eliminated"">Can employee risk be eliminated?</h3>
<p>The short answer, unfortunately, is no, but some aspects of employee risk can be effectively managed and contained. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Provision by companies of an internal ‘whistleblowing’ facility so that employees are able to report any suspicious activity anonymously and without fear of reprisal has been shown to be particularly useful in combating employee fraud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many treasuries employ technology which can analyse and sense-test trades input by humans and highlight them for further checking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Employee absenteeism levels can be reduced by ensuring that there is a positive atmosphere in the workplace.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Fortunately for treasurers in well-managed companies, there are usually robust procedures in place to mitigate most elements of employee risk and prevent problems from escalating into a company-wide crisis.</p>
<p>Treasurers should be able to place considerable reliance on their in-house corporate security and IT security functions.</p>
<h4 id=""monitoring-employee-activity"">Monitoring employee activity</h4>
<p>In the UK over 60% of personal on-line shopping is conducted at work.</p>
<p>Employees on average spend at least an hour every workday on their computers doing things other than working. In many companies this theft of company time by employees is a kind of tacitly accepted low-level fraud.</p>
<p>Employers have tools available to them, such as network sniffer technology, to monitor this type of activity and also more serious types of abuse of the internet by employees, such as downloading offensive material and distributing it via email.</p>
<p>With this technology deployed in-house, fraud analysts can search, retrieve and replay every screen viewed and every keystroke made by an employee. This makes it possible to see exactly what an employee was doing over a specific period.</p>
<p>Other types of employee monitoring may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use of CCTV in the workplace</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vehicle movement monitoring</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Telephone monitoring.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Where monitoring is in place, employers in most markets are under obligation both to advise their employees and to obtain their consent – this may be done through employee acceptance of a workplace Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>Typically an Acceptable Use Policy would be set out by the company governing employee use of business communications tools. UK employers, for example, have to comply fully with the requirements of the Data Protection Act, the Human Rights Act and the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
<p>Many countries have similar legislation in place. A treasurer can expect the company’s HR function to be fully conversant with all applicable legislation and to ensure company-wide compliance with this.</p>
<h4 id=""the-buck-stops-with-the-treasurer"">The buck stops with the treasurer</h4>
<p>There are many ways in which the actions of employees can threaten a company’s operations.</p>
<p>Fortunately most threats to the company are usually extinguished before they materialise, but when they do the effects can sometimes be very damaging.</p>
<p>Employee risk comes in so many different guises that it can be very hard to guard against. It is, though, part of the job description of every responsible treasurer to ensure that this risk is managed as effectively as possible.</p>
