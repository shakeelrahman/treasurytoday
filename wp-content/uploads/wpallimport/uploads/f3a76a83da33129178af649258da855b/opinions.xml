<p><em>With the world in turmoil, and the threat of inflation raising rates thereby making historic debt loads unsustainable, not to mention little understood derivative risks at banks, treasurers face a tough time as guardians of company cash and guarantors of liquidity. This is a good time to revisit the repeal of Glass-Steagall in 1999, and even further to consider the merits of narrow banking.</em></p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4 id="narrow-banking">Narrow banking</h4>
<p>The term narrow banking can cover a variety of bank structures, ranging from Glass-Steagall era “banks” which did run loan books but were excluded from investment banking activities to banks which place all their deposits as deposits in turn with their central bank. The latter – more narrow definition – means not participating in fractional reserve banking aka printing money.</p>
<p>Of course, the more narrow definition is close to what might be achieved with Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), depending how it is implemented. CBDCs are much discussed but remain in pilot mode in a few jurisdictions. Responsible central bankers state that implementing CBDC should be a political decision, not a central bank decision, and there are many objections to CBDCs – not least that most of the societal benefits can be achieved through other (less disruptive) means.</p>
<p>Of course, with (most Western) governments inundated with historical debt levels (which keep growing to new highs) and untenable pension and health care obligations, a sceptical treasurer may have reservations about even central bank money. But for now, unless they want to hold gold or more dubiously cryptocurrencies, fiat currency remains the only liquid and generally accepted medium of exchange.</p>
<h4 id="benefits">Benefits</h4>
<p>For the purposes of this article, “narrow bank” will refer to the more narrow bank described above ie a bank that places all its customer deposits with its central bank, and does not engage in lending, securities, derivatives, etcetera.</p>
<p>Such a bank can serve corporates with deposit (store of value) and cash management services (exchange of value) services, but not lending, trading, issuance, hedging, etcetera.</p>
<p>From both deposit and cash management perspectives, a narrow bank offers considerable benefits for corporates.</p>
<p>Start with deposits. Treasurers usually think about investments in terms of the acronym SLY (security, liquidity, yield):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Security (do not lose cash).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liquidity (keep cash available).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yield (earn interest on cash).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="security">Security</h4>
<p>For now, central bank funds – despite the risk of inflation devaluing fiat currency – remain the most secure and liquid store of value potentially available to treasurers.</p>
<p>In the past decades, amidst rolling banking crises, a number of large corporates have applied for banking licences primarily to gain access to central bank deposits. But this is an expensive and complex method that is only available to very large corporates, and the cost, complexity and risk of banking licences only keeps growing.</p>
<p>From this perspective, a narrow bank offers near direct access to central bank funds, and therefore the most secure store of value possible within the constraints of fiat currency.</p>
<h4 id="liquidity">Liquidity</h4>
<p>As for security, so for liquidity. There is no more liquid investment than central bank funds. The scale and ubiquity of fiat currency mean that they have higher availability and lower costs than any alternatives such as securities, gold, cryptocurrencies, and so forth.</p>
<p>Since a narrow bank will not be lending out funds, and therefore has no liquidity gap and no risk of a run on funds (because corporate deposits are in turn deposited with its central bank), narrow bank deposits represent the most liquid investment product imaginable within the constraints of fiat currency. Currently, most treasurers consider short-term sovereign debt (eg US Treasury Notes) to be the most liquid investment, but even these most liquid instruments require a well-functioning trading market, and we have seen these dry up (eg 2019 Repo crisis).</p>
<h4 id="yield">Yield</h4>
<p>Treasurers fully understand that SLY is in order of importance, and they know that loosing cash or not having cash available are unacceptable outcomes. But yield is the easiest metric to measure and in practice often the most discussed. And many would fear that a direct pass through to central bank funds would offer unexciting yields.</p>
<p>Indeed, narrow bank deposits preclude playing the yield curve and arbitraging credit risk. And they effectively preclude outsourcing those things to lending banks, which is the current reality. On the other hand, the capital costs and organisational complexity that arise from lending and fractional reserve banking impose huge costs on lending banks, and those costs are passed on and marked up to corporates and other customers.</p>
<p>While a narrow bank is precluded from tenor and credit risk arbitrage, it has a great opportunity for cost arbitrage. Thus a narrow bank can compete effectively with lending bank demand deposit offerings.</p>
<h4 id="accounting">Accounting</h4>
<p>Narrow bank deposits will be treated like other bank deposits – at par. This makes them more attractive from an accounting perspective than high liquidity money market funds (liquidity funds), which are commonly used by corporates as a store of value.</p>
<p>Ever since Reserve Primary Fund ‘broke the buck’ in 2008 (its net asset value fell to $0.97), regulators and accounting bodies have busied themselves dreaming up ever more complex rules and revaluations to dispel the illusion that liquidity funds as are good as cash. This is certainly a good thing from the perspective of financial transparency, but it has brought more work and cost to treasurers using these instruments. It has also increased the costs of running liquidity funds themselves, thereby reducing yields.</p>
<p>Narrow bank deposits offer all the benefits touted by liquidity funds, with both lower costs and higher security and liquidity.</p>
<h4 id="cash-management">Cash management</h4>
<p>Many of the benefits of narrow banking as a store of value in terms of security, liquidity and yield apply to cash management as well. To the extent that balance management (cash pooling in its various forms) result in credit balances, the benefits are the same. (A narrow bank will not be able to offer overdraft on balance management products because it is precluded from lending.)</p>
<p>From a payments perspective, the benefits of security and liquidity are obvious. The lower regulatory and organisational overheads of narrow banking, together with the absence of legacy technology stacks, would enable it to be fully cost competitive with full banks.</p>
<p>From a network perspective, assuming that narrow banks will be start-ups, they may not have the global reach of some of the largest full banks. On the other hand, we seem to be seeing a radical withdrawal from global banking by most large full banks, as they decide to focus on core and profitable markets. Further, the evidence from the success of retail FX and payment banks such as wise.com shows that they can be very competitive in both cost and reach by availing the services of their partner payment service providers.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>It may take a while to become common, but it is clear that simpler banking – and especially narrow banking – can offer many benefits for treasurers and their employers.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4 id="api-landscape">API landscape</h4>
<p>Although APIs are much hyped at the moment, and heavily promoted by banks who have developed them, their adoption by treasurers – and even by TMS vendors – is hindered by a lack of standardisation and the difficulties of implementing bilateral API connectivity.</p>
<p>APIs can use different standards for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Functionality (both what and how).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Content (the specific formatting of information).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protocol (the mechanics of communication).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SWIFT, who are having good success with ISO 20022 XML as the common standard for file-based bank connectivity, are also working on API standardisation. SWIFT’s progress with API standardisation is slowed partly by the complexities involved and partly by banks’ desire to differentiate themselves in the API space.</p>
<p>Thus, treasurers seeking to evolve their bank connectivity into APIs are finding that the ambitions are thwarted by the heterogenous offerings and the cost and complexity of bilateral bank connectivity. This is especially problematic for treasurers who need real-time bank connectivity.</p>
<h4 id="fintechs-to-the-rescue">Fintechs to the rescue</h4>
<p>This issue of heterogeneity and cost and complexity is an ideal environment for nimble fintechs to address. Established players have little incentive to address this area, either because they have vested interests (like banks wanting to differentiate or ERP vendors having their own proprietary solutions) or because the costs are too high to be attractive (like TMS vendors finding the heterogeneity overwhelming).</p>
<p>Fintechs tend to build from the ground up for diverse connectivity. They are normally too small and specialised to build broad applications, so they build specific solutions predicated on connectivity as a means to integrate into corporate ecosystems. So they have a natural advantage in addressing this challenge.</p>
<p>Fintechs also have less (or no) attachment to legacy, and are thus able to pivot faster to attractive niches (broadly areas where customers have problems that are not well addressed).</p>
<h4 id="pivot-to-apis">Pivot to APIs</h4>
<p>A good example of this kind of pivot is FinLync. FinLync started with building apps within SAP to provide specific treasury and finance related functionality that was not inherent in the ERP. Led by customer demand, they started to develop APIs with their users’ banks to provide real-time functionality.</p>
<p>Demand from non SAP potential customers led FinLync to develop its bank connectivity API aggregator as a standalone product. This can be used by any API enabled solution at the corporate.</p>
<h4 id="how-it-works">How it works</h4>
<p>The concept of an API middleware is not new per se. Google Apigee, amongst others, offers this kind of functionality. The issue with such generic solutions is that they require the user to specify in detail the input and output across the four dimensions mentioned earlier. This is still a lot of work for treasurers whose focus is on bank connectivity, not to mention the hassle of keeping up with the evolution of each bank’s API functionality.</p>
<p>Further, many systems that are API enabled are not necessarily able to connect to bank APIs. For example, most ERPs use APIs extensively to connect their different modules. For example, SAP calls this iDocs – but that does not mean they support bank connectivity.</p>
<p>What differentiates FinLync is its focus on bank connectivity. FinLync relieves treasurers of the grunt work of specifying each bank’s API and ensuring a harmonised data flow to their own applications. They are also actively updating their multi-bank API aggregator with new functionality as banks deliver it. In fact, FinLync often advise banks both on the functionality required by corporates and on the actual implementation, acting as the de facto standardiser of bank API connectivity.</p>
<p>Conceptually, Finlync’s multi-bank API aggregator can be seen as the API version of what middleware and SWIFT provide for bank file-based connectivity. Corporate applications like ERPs and TMSs have only one API connection with the aggregator, which in turn converts the data across the four dimensions mentioned to bank specific APIs.</p>
<p>FinLync have already established API connectivity with over 30 global banks, and are continuously adding more, based on customer needs. Depending on bank responsiveness, they can add bank APIs within days.</p>
<h4 id="how-treasurers-benefit">How treasurers benefit</h4>
<p>Treasurers who need real-time bank data have to use APIs. Normal MT940 bank statements are sent at end of day by banks, and are thus practically only available to treasurers at the start of the following business day. Even MT942 intraday statements are typically sent once or twice per day, at most hourly, and not all banks provide this service. APIs enable near real-time updates as and when transactions occur.</p>
<p>Bank API specifications are different for each bank. So treasurers using multiple banks face the challenges of implementing – and crucially maintaining – multiple different API connections to their different banks. Such implementations are expensive and time consuming, and, since API technology is evolving fast, maintenance is a big problem.</p>
<p>Using FinLync’s multi-bank API aggregator shields corporates from this complexity and cost – essentially outsourcing it to FinLync. This provides corporates with a less painful way to benefit from API connectivity with their banks.</p>
<p>Further, the aggregator provides a contractually simple solution – corporates already have legal relationships with their banks, and they need only the added relationship with FinLync.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>The multi-bank API aggregator provides an elegant solution for treasurers seeking to evolve to API connectivity with their bank. It avoids the cost and complexity of developing API connectivity with each bank bilaterally, and helps them retain flexibility when they need to add new banks.</p></div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>The allure of made to measure is always seductive, and the thrill and instant gratification of walking out of a shop with a well-fitting outfit has strong appeal. While the analogy may not exactly fit treasury solutions, there are different benefits for both building and buying. More interesting would be to have one’s cake and eat it – apologies for the metaphor overload.</p>
<h3 id="build">Build</h3>
<p>The allure of building made to measure is always strong. Everyone dreams of a solution tailor made for their specific needs. But even assuming those needs are realistically specified, do they have the patience to work through to such a solution?</p>
<p>The conclusion from treasurers who have gone down this road include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Building is not the fastest solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clarity about the desired solution is critical.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process takes patience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building takes more energy than buying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outcomes are not guaranteed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Treasurers who have been down this road (and remain willing to talk about their experience) all warn that it is neither the easiest nor the quickest way to implement solutions. Even successful projects carry high risk of failure.</p>
<p>Whereas with an established solution, existing users can be consulted to determine if the solution works, is scalable, is secure, and so forth, in the build or co-create scenario one cannot know that a viable outcome will come from the effort.</p>
<p>Even if the basic algorithm works, one cannot be sure that the underlying architecture will meet corporate standards for scalability and security.</p>
<p>This risk is compounded when the requirements are ill conceived or poorly expressed. Buying existing solutions allows treasurers to make detailed mapping of their needs against existing implementations with high certainty that if there is a good fit the solution will work properly.</p>
<p>Furthermore, buying existing solutions allows treasurers to benefit from other corporate experience. Corporates may vary, but it is a common misconception that corporate requirements are unique. In the end a loan is a loan, a hedge is a hedge, and forth. (Even if emerging markets can throw up requirements that surprise even experienced system vendors.)</p>
<h3 id="buy">Buy</h3>
<p>Buying off the shelf solutions may have less cachet than co-creation, but for many overworked treasurers the line of least resistance is attractive. There is strong appeal in buying a solution with a proven implementation and user satisfaction record.</p>
<p>There used to be a meme that buying SAP meant buying best practice in code. Despite well publicised cases of big implementations thrown out because they did not meet the buyers requirements, there is certainly some truth to this concept. Implementing a well-established market leading solution can at best be an opportunity to challenge and re-think business as usual.</p>
<p>Buying established solutions generally allows treasurers a quicker and more reliable route to resolving process challenges than building or co-creation.</p>
<p>These are strong benefits for buying established solutions. On the other hand, treasurers are beholden to the wider organisation, and in many cases to its history. An organisation thrown together from mergers and acquisitions, with a diversity of internal systems, may generate very unique treasury requirements such that no single off the shelf solution really meets all requirements.</p>
<p>Since treasurers are generally not in a position to mandate, for example, a single instance ERP across their organisations, it is often incumbent on them to adapt to the corporate eco-system they inhabit.</p>
<p>Middleware and data warehouses (or data lakes or even data oceans) may provide an integration layer across heterogenous corporate systems, but, again, these are not normally within treasury scope. This can leave treasurers with uncomfortable compromises around functionality. For example, the TMS best suited to integrating heterogenous ERPs may not be the best at risk management or hedge accounting.</p>
<h3 id="mash-up">Mash-up</h3>
<p>For readers not familiar with the term mashup, Wikipedia offers this explanation: “A mashup (computer industry jargon), in web development, is a web page or web application that uses content from more than one source to create a single new service displayed in a single graphical interface. … The term implies easy, fast integration, frequently using open application programming interfaces (open API) and data sources to produce enriched results that were not necessarily the original reason for producing the raw source data. The term mashup originally comes from creating something by combining elements from two or more sources.”</p>
<p>The basic concept is that, in this time of APIs and cloud services, solutions can be cobbled together by connecting best of breed solutions into an integrated solution meeting the requirements at hand.</p>
<p>The trick here is to use only very open software which allows data to be shared by the different components seamlessly. Unfortunately APIs are not as ubiquitous as the hype would suggest. Many even quite modern TMSs are not as open as one would wish.</p>
<p>Most treasurers do not want their non-treasury colleagues to have to learn the TMS and remember more user identities and passwords – not to mention pay per user licence fees. It is clearly good practice to feed commonly used treasury data into corporate Business Intelligence (BI) solutions for consumption across the wider organisation. Many even modern seeming TMSs do this by exporting data periodically to the BI. This means the data seen by non-treasury colleagues is not real time.</p>
<p>The alternatives to periodic data dumps include real time APIs and database views. The former posts updates to the external system as they occur. The latter involves creating live views (virtual tables, in SQL this is written as “CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition;”) which can effectively provide real-time read only access to external systems.</p>
<p>Read only access – even though far from ubiquitous – is much simpler than writing to a system such as a TMS. For two way integration (read and write), this effectively requires APIs. (Writing directly to a system’s database introduces myriad risks, not least security.)</p>
<p>The most rigorous systems effectively separate the user interface from the business logic and from the database. They typically use internal APIs to connect the user interface with the business logic, and optimally these APIs would be published for access by other systems and data sources. (The business logic communicates with the database via data languages like SQL, which can be considered as data APIs.)</p>
<p>In such a scenario, treasurers can select best of breed or at least best fit solutions for each important aspect of their requirements and connect them through APIs. Thus achieving integration of their different requirements such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Balance reporting/bank connectivity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cash flow forecasting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Risk management and exposure reporting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Debt management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investment management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>System of record (typically a TMS).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Business Intelligence (BI) (typically the corporate standard).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, such solutions require very open systems.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Most treasurers will be well served by off the shelf solutions that (should) offer predictability in performance and implementation. Thinking through the pros and cons of build vs buy opens some interesting avenues for treasurers to consider in creating wider solutions to best meet their needs when single solutions do not quite tick all the boxes.</p>

<h4 id="">Simple treasury</h4>
<p>The treasurer’s job is – in principle – rather simple: to manage cash flow (and its attendant risks) effectively and ensure cash availability. Then a litany of complications creep in:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Complex business models driven by customer demands and internal history and politics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regulations from a plethora of authorities who do not seem to talk with each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multi country jurisdictions and business behaviours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rapidly evolving financial markets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Roiling fiscal landscapes.</p>
</li>
<p>It is easy to drown in conflicting demands.</p>
</ul>
<p>At the risk of pushing the metaphor too far, treasurers tend to be swimming head down in the details, just trying to keep their heads above water. Without the luxury of a helicopter view (or even better satellite view), it is very hard to make confident decisions.</p>
<h4 id="priorities">Priorities</h4>
<p>One place to start is with clear priorities. With clarity about overall direction, it is easier to plot a course through the rocks.</p>
<p>For example, cash availability aka liquidity must be a top priority for any treasurer. Difficulty will vary between cash rich businesses and those that are struggling, and the line between the two can be fleeting. Further, there is the aspect of having cash where, when and how it is needed – missing a payroll is not a good reflection on a treasurer’s competence.</p>
<p>Cash availability comes at a cost, and how to balance the two forces has to be a business level decision – because the survival of the business depends on it – normally expressed in terms of capital structure. If the board does not clarify this, treasurers are navigating without a clear heading.</p>
<p>Making sure that the business has cash in the right place, at the right time, and in the right currency, also requires balancing cost and risk against availability. It is easy to leave cash floating like jetsam around the planet in disparate and unconnected banks. But that is not efficient. It will probably please local finance managers, but is it the right thing for the group as a whole?</p>
<p>Without clear priorities, balancing such tensions can quickly become arbitrary and ultimately destructive.</p>
<h4 id="the-pareto-principle">The Pareto Principle</h4>
<p>Much corporate complexity comes from outlier or thin tail cases. It sometimes seems that half the effort is expended on exceptions. While the business world can be complex, and things can go wrong, it is wise to focus effort on keeping the most important things on track – if only to retain dry powder for the most important exceptions.</p>
<p>Rigorously applying the 80:20 rule can be very helpful in focussing efforts. For example, achieving real time visibility over cash seems like a good idea. But is it really a wise use of resources to require full connectivity from a non-core bank supporting a small and remote subsidiary? Probably a weekly manual input from the local finance manager would be more appropriate.</p>
<p>Cash flow forecasting is a critical process for treasury – without cash flow forecasts, treasury cannot operate. Again, this is an area where the 80:20 rule is precious. The focus has to be on the parts of the business which have both large values and large volatility. In other words, put effort where it will produce the maximum actionable information.</p>
<h4 id="the-role-of-technology">The role of technology</h4>
<p>Technology is often touted as a solution and a time saver – and indeed it is. Sometimes implementation can be a daunting task, especially for already overloaded treasurers. The first rule should be that implementations are not weekend jobs.</p>
<p>One tension in system implementations is between adopting the system’s native way of working versus customisation. Since customisation introduces complexity and sets up future complexity when upgrades require further customisation, it behoves the treasurer to be very clear about their needs. Does the new system really have to mimic existing reports, or might the underlying objective be met more easily (and cheaply) by adopting the ways of working embedded in the system? Does the system really need to be customised for the obscure tax requirement of a small and obscure market? And if the system in question does not cater for the instruments being traded, is it the right system?</p>
<h4 id="apis-and-middleware">APIs and middleware</h4>
<p>Another tension is between the intuitive simplicity of a single solution vs connecting specialised tools. APIs and middleware are increasingly changing the pros and cons of this equation. Often trying to squeeze everything into a solution into which it does not fit well creates much more complexity than it is worth.</p>
<p>The attraction of a single vendor is seductive from a simplicity perspective, but knitting together specialised tools may be more effective. In any case, connectivity is increasingly important, so it is incumbent on treasurers to develop or buy expertise in this area. In system procurement decision making, open interfacing must be a key criteria.</p>
<p>An example of mistaken simplification can be choosing to use the TMS dashboard to report to colleagues outside of treasury. It is generally much better for colleagues to feed them information in whatever system they are used to consuming data from the whole business. Most businesses have some kind of business intelligence (BI) solution, and treasury data should fit into that rather than force colleagues to learn and use the TMS.</p>
<p>Another example is in the area of bank connectivity, which despite decades of progress with ISO 20022 messaging and standardisation, can still be akin to navigating between Scylla and Charybdis. Even basic SFTP, which is a decades old bedrock of connectivity, can be tricky, since banks are endlessly creative in their security protocols. Treasurers would be wise to opt for minimum viable connectivity, rather than to tweak each connection or build specific host-to-host connections. Even better to outsource the problems to a bank connectivity as a service provider.</p>
<p>Just as middleware can smooth connections with non-treasury colleagues and banks, it can also help with the many connection points with which treasury typically needs to interface. Multiple ERPs make a strong use case for middleware, as do other internal and external systems.</p>
<p>Reporting is often a challenge, and in this area direct API or middleware mediated solutions can be a good solution where other reporting tools like BI systems may be a better fit. But it is important to resist the flexibility and attractions of treasury by Excel in this regard, because Excel inevitably becomes a dangerous shoal in itself.</p>
<p>Whatever solution is chosen, the future will undoubtedly bring surprises, and open systems – along with the capability to use them – are the best prophylactic.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>Complexity is ineluctable, just as reefs and currents are part of navigation. Treasurers need a clear sense of direction, personal adaptability, and the right tools to weather the storms that enliven their lives.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4>How does your professional background and experience help you in your new role?</h4>
<p>I have spent all of my career in BNP Paribas – I joined in 2004 in Paris and I have now been based in Asia Pacific for 14 years. My whole career has also been in the trade business, which is a really interesting activity because with trade solutions you are very close to the real economy; you are financing actual businesses and having a real impact. Financing of trade and supply chains requires local on-the-ground knowledge, which is how my experience in Asia Pacific really helps me in my current role.</p>
<p>In Asia Pacific there are so many unique local practices, and each country has its own regulations and local needs. My career has so far spanned 12 markets, so I have gained an appreciation for the nuances and differences between them. Earlier in my career, I was a relationship manager and that experience meant that I have been able to keep the client at the forefront of my thinking and put myself in their shoes and help them achieve their goals.</p>
<h4>What are your immediate priorities?</h4>
<p>BNP Paribas is very committed to Asia Pacific and has been in the region for many years – in fact, in some countries it has had a presence for over 100 years – and that frames my immediate priorities. I will focus on both the Asia Pacific inbound and outbound trade flows and leverage our global network for our clients. We have many multinational corporation clients that are typically from Europe or the United States and are using the bank’s expertise to grow their market share in Asia Pacific. On the other hand, we also have a large pool of Asian corporate clients that are expanding beyond Asia – we help them do that through our global network.</p>
<p>With the European multinational clients, we have been following their growth for years as they have expanded in Asia. With the Asian clients, we have seen that business grow substantially in recent years, particularly with opportunities like China’s infrastructure Belt Road Initiative, and we have also been supporting clients that are headquartered in a range of countries such as Australia, China, Japan and South Korea in their overseas projects.</p>
<h4>Where will you focus your efforts with digitising trade and supply chain finance? Where can you make an impact in the short-term? What longer-term objectives do you have?</h4>
<p>Digitalisation is a broad topic and since Covid we have witnessed an acceleration of trends that would have taken years to achieve had Covid not happened. Aside from the change in work patterns, the pandemic has increased the demand from clients to digitalise trade across multiple channels. We find that their needs depend on their size and also the maturity of their organisation.</p>
<p>In terms of having an immediate impact, we offer an award-winning solution – Document Exchange Connect – which is a simple and intuitive platform that digitalises the entire trade life cycle and streamlines communication between the client and the bank. It replaces email and means that we can easily update the client at every stage of their trade and supply chain transactions, and it also gives an audit trail. In the short term, I will be focusing on enhancing this platform and introducing it to more of our clients.</p>
<p>Longer term, we will be keeping a close eye on the various industry initiatives that are evolving, which all have the goal of digitising trade and supply chain finance. We have been heavily involved and at the forefront of developing many of these platforms and solutions – along with our competitors – so we know them well. One such initiative is our work with Singapore Customs and the electronic Banker’s Guarantee programme on the Networked Trade Platform, which was launched in November 2020.</p>
<p>We also have dedicated specialists who regularly speak to clients to understand the direction they would like to see these initiatives go, and explore partnership opportunities with other technology providers – it is a constant dialogue. One of these key initiatives is our involvement in developing Contour, a bank-owned, blockchain-based digital trade finance platform under development in Singapore. It is primarily used to process letters of credit (LCs) – on average, it has reduced the time needed to process LCs from ten days to less than 24 hours.</p>
<h4>What are the challenges for corporates to adopt sustainable trade and supply chain finance, and what can you do to help them?</h4>
<p>ESG [environment, social and governance] is at the heart of our strategy at BNP Paribas. We find that clients are familiar with green bonds and green loans – they are quite mature products in the ESG space with proper governance and frameworks. However, in trade finance, there is no formal framework that has been defined globally.</p>
<p>We want to help clients on this journey and help them integrate sustainability into their business. For example, in July we issued a HK$332m bank guarantee for Henderson Land’s green residential development of the former Kai Tak airport site in Hong Kong, which took into account their green credentials.</p>
<p>ESG is not just client-centred – it has a wider scope – and it means that we have to constantly talk with clients and help them think about wider considerations, such as water consumption, energy efficiency and social impact, and how they can embed these kinds of key performance indicators (KPIs) into their supply chain financing. We developed a KPI matrix as part of the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s Green and Sustainability Linked Loan Grant Scheme, which was launched in November 2020, to encourage clients to be more responsible in their sourcing and procuring. If they meet these sustainability KPIs then we can reward them with more favourable terms. We want to accompany clients on this journey and be in constant communication with them about where they want to be.</p></div>

<p><em>As AI in various forms moves into the treasury space, this is a good time to take stock of the benefits and pitfalls of this increasingly popular set of technologies. A recent McKinsey survey finds that 50% of businesses have adopted AI in some form and part of their business.

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h3 id="what-is-ai">What is AI?</h3>
<p>Despite the sometimes-creepy prescience of our phones and search engines, we are still far from the kind of AI popularised by the media – like Stanley Kubrick’s HAL. (HAL would be a ‘general AI’, whereas businesses today are using narrow AI; general AI remains a dream for the industry, and some say it may never arrive.) Although some AI technologies are making decisions in retail finance and insurance (as well as narrow domains such as trading), most treasury applications comprise AI assistance rather than control.</p>
<p>McKinsey breaks AI into two branches:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Machine learning (ML) in various forms finds statistical relationships between different data points; treasurers can think of it as technical analysis on steroids (because machines can pile through more data and relationships than human analysts).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deep learning comprises neural networks and similar technologies that seek to mimic how the human brain operates by reinforcing data pathways that seem successful.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>McKinsey further sub-divides machine learning into:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Supervised ML requires human trainers to provide data with correct answers to train the algorithm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unsupervised ML is more exploratory for example searching through data for interesting correlations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reinforcement learning means that the algorithm tries different approaches and weights the most successful ones so that those are used more.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Deep learning sub-divides into:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Convolutional neural networks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recurrent neural networks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transformers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generative adversarial networks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ML seems to be the most commonly used AI technique in treasury. It is suitable for forecasting and error detection. In some cases, neural networks are being used for fraud detection, but often this problem is similar to error detection.</p>
<h3 id="statistics">Statistics</h3>
<p>To some degree, treasurers can benefit from their experience with statistics to avoid some of the pitfalls with AI. ML especially equates quite closely with familiar treasury techniques like Value at Risk (VaR). ML will often develop more complex relationships than the correlations and volatilities used for VaR.</p>
<p>A common problem with VaR is that it relies on a limited historical dataset – often as short as one year. When markets change direction, as they periodically do, the last year is not a good guide to potential losses. Treasurers have developed mitigants such as stress testing to complement VaR’s weaknesses in this regard.</p></div>

<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>With ML, treasurers need to be vigilant in an equivalent way. This is especially true because ML may develop more complex data relationships that can be difficult for treasurers to understand – the so called ‘black box’ or ‘explainability’ problem. So it is all the more important to be vigilant about the potential limitations of the dataset being used. For example does it cover a full economic cycle?</p>
<p>The year 2020 has provided a good example of this problem. For instance, forecasts built from two or three year old datasets will not have captured the turmoil caused by COVID-19. This is analogous to how the Asian currency crisis at the end of the last century ‘broke’ many VaR metrics.</p>
<h3 id="data">Data</h3>
<p>Most treasurers will have read that ‘data is the new oil’. This allusion is based on the importance of data to ‘feed’ AI in order to get the desired results. This is as true of cash flows as it is of clicks and visits that social media use to maximise their manipulation of our attention.</p>
<p>The answers, suggestions, and warnings that AI generates will at best be as good as the data that it is being fed with. Treasurers with effective data solutions, often data warehouses or lakes or oceans, have a big advantage in availing the benefits of AI. Although there are some AI technologies that handle unstructured data, and natural language processing may seem to offer an easy way to cut through data clutter, in practice treasury AI benefits from clean and well-structured raw data.</p>
<p>So treasury AI projects often start with collecting and cleaning underlying data. This can be a large project since, to obtain the most useful results, treasurers will often need to feed their AI with non-treasury data – for example, combining cash flows with accounts receivable and accounts payable data and even sales and production planning.</p>
<h3 id="explainability">Explainability</h3>
<p>As alluded to above, there is an issue with explaining AI’s forecasts and suggestions and, where relevant, decisions. AI will comb through datasets and find relationships in the data that are invisible to human observers and, even when exposed, do not make sense to humans. AI is playing with 1s and 0s – it has no common sense. On the other hand it has no preconceptions. When DeepMind’s AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol in March 2016, human experts had great difficulty fathoming that AlphaGo had not simply played with discipline but had in fact developed completely new strategies never considered by thousands of generations of go masters.</p>
<p>Managers will quite naturally feel reluctant to follow tactics or strategies that they do not understand. To some extent top management uses their understanding of subordinate experts to become comfortable with decisions they do not personally understand. But with AI there can often be no explanation, and there is no silver-tongued expert to get management on board.</p>
<p>This issue is such a big problem for the AI industry that it has spawned a new sub industry –eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) refers to a set of techniques that help show how a ML algorithm comes up with predictions and suggestions. XAI potentially enables humans to better understand (and trust) outputs from complex, ‘black box’ models and helps decision makers know the relevant data characteristics driving the output.</p>
<p>Perhaps most salient for treasurers is that this issue is another reason why the question is not how to replace analysts with AI but rather to find practical ways to augment analysts with AI. Treasurers will need all their domain knowledge more than ever, and they will have to leverage this with understanding what the AI is doing. AI is a new (albeit tireless) team member, and must be understood and managed like the human team members.</p>
<h3 id="bias">Bias</h3>
<p>Bias is often discussed as a problem with AI. Training data may be skewed, especially when dealing with human issues. The conceptual equivalent for treasury would revolve around changes in historical patterns like the COVID-19 impact mentioned above, and to the potential for business model changes to trip up AIs honed as-is or business as usual (BAU) data.</p>
<p>Treasurers need to be vigilant when new product and or market segments are introduced because AI is definitely not clairvoyant. The AI will proceed on a BAU assumption and will often need to be re-trained. This is a challenge for new products and markets because there is no historical data with which to train the AI. Layering human assumptions will at best reduce AI’s ability to bring new light to issues. Even mixing up data from previous changes may not give the correct results – after all humans are also heading into uncharted territory.</p>
<p>There is no easy fix for this kind of situation. In the end it comes back to the collaborative AI concept – treasurers need to understand the limitations of their AI team members and manage them accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>AI is tireless and fast, and also devoid of common sense. Treasurers need to get a feel for how to use AI productively, just as they need to understand the strengths and weaknesses of their human team members. AI is probably best thought of as a tireless ‘gopher’ assisting human treasury staff. And any attempt to enhance treasury with AI must start with clean and complete data.</p></div>

<h4 id="liquidity">Liquidity</h4>
<p>Liquidity is still top of mind for many treasurers. This has driven extra urgency for cash visibility and cash flow forecasting. Another aspect of liquidity is ensuring access to cash from the capital markets. Treasurers have been working hard on both fronts.</p>
<p>Many treasuries still rely on manual processes – in treasury itself or at subsidiaries or both – such as transcribing or copy and pasting bank statements and Excel and email for cash visibility. This manual approach is slow and error prone. The uncertainties brought by COVID-19 no longer allow treasurers the luxury of such inefficiency.</p>
<p>Treasurers who relied on manual processes for cash visibility have scrambled to digitise in order to increase the speed and accuracy of their cash visibility. This has the further benefit of freeing limited treasury resources to work on more value-added issues, such as forecasting and business support.</p>
<p>Treasurers are using the full range of solutions for cash visibility, depending on their circumstances. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>SWIFT for Corporates.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Other multi-bank platforms like TIS and Fides.</p>
</li>
<li><p>TMS bank connectivity.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Using a relationship bank to consolidate multiple banks.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some are using middleware and data warehouse technology.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With cash visibility cleaned up – which means seeing 90% of prior day closing cash balances at the start of day – treasurers have been using this as a starting point for short term cash flow forecasting – aka cash positioning.</p>
<p>With resources tight across treasury and subsidiaries, forward thinking treasurers are using machine learning to forecast short term future cash flows. The important caveat here is that machine learning basically relies on patterns in past data to predict future flows – the uncertainties of COVID-19 mean that for example customer payment behaviour this year is likely to deviate from 2019 behaviour. On the other hand, machine learning works with very granular data – in the case of accounts receivable, invoice level data – so it can spot changes in trends such as customers delaying payments much faster than human analysis would.</p>
<p>Treasurers are also using some of the resources saved by automating to deepen their longer-term cash flow forecasts over multi month and sometimes multi-year timeframes. Of course, the best forecast is only as good as the assumptions behind it, so forward thinking treasurers are using scenario analysis and min-max to explore pertinent different trajectories, such as current trajectory or second wave and so forth.</p>
<h4 id="capital-markets">Capital markets</h4>
<p>Because cash flow forecasts are both volatile and constrained by the multiplicity of possible scenarios, treasurers are willing to pay the high cost of maintaining extra cash. They see this as a form of insurance against some of the dire scenarios which have to be assessed as possible and maybe even likely to happen.</p>
<p>The simplest way to load up on cash may seem to be to draw down on revolvers and other undrawn credit. But this has not been simple for many – banks have balked and tried to trigger MACs; they have also had to manage credit from a regulatory and societal perspective at a time when there has been a lot of demand.</p>
<p>This has meant treasurers effectively have to negotiate with lenders to explain their approach and needs. Some have extended tenors to avoid liquidity squeezes in coming years. Covenants have been re-negotiated to allow for some of the extremes that the more negative scenarios imply.</p>
<p>Treasurers have also switched to what used to be exotic sources of funds outside the typical capital market and bank sources – peer to peer funding, high net worth individuals, non-bank lenders, sustainable financing, and others.</p>
<p>Of course, once they have the cash, they have to find a place to park it. Negative interest rates are a given in most western markets. Treasurers focus on the spread between funding cost and investment yield in any case. Some treasurers have reassessed their net investment foreign exchange exposures to find opportunities to park cash in positive interest rate markets, but for most the FX swaps required to maintain neutral FX positions obviate any benefit.</p>
<p>In any case, credit and liquidity risk are generally top of mind, not yield. Especially in these tumultuous times, treasurers are sticking with the cash investment mantra ‘SLY’ – security, liquidity, yield, in that order.</p>
<h4 id="communication">Communication</h4>
<p>Dealing with debt capital markets to draw down, extend and re-negotiate finance is just one area in which treasurers have had to brush up their communication skills. Internal communication has also become critical within treasury teams to maintain cohesion, with peers to ensure effectiveness, and with senior management who are now taking a keen interest in liquidity (and hence survival).</p>
<p>Not all treasurers are enthusiastic about the plethora of virtual meetings and team platforms, but all emphasise the need for adapted and deeper communication to maintain team cohesion. An example is checking in regularly with team members without burdening them with micro management. Listening becomes a key skill to avoid distracting team members unnecessarily.</p>
<h4 id="technology">Technology</h4>
<p>COVID-19 has brought treasurers’ focus squarely on technology. Whatever the use case, cloud has come into prominence as a safe and reliable way to support working from home and working from anywhere paradigms.</p>
<p>While cloud has been an obvious solution to virtual teamwork, security concerns over payments and other sensitive data have grown. Treasurers (and their IT colleagues) worry about the implications of accessing sensitive systems and making large value approvals from potentially insecure home networks.</p>
<p>One scenario that comes up is where, despite a solid VPN which most corporates have for remote working, work laptops may be compromised by weaknesses in home wiFi from IoT devices and so forth. Another concern is that the latency of home WiFi may not be fast enough for online trading.</p>
<p>Although one reads about American tech firms paying to upgrade employees’ home offices with hardware and security and even furniture, that does not seem to be the norm from recent reports. Rather IT departments are deploying – often confidential – packet sniffing machine learning to detect and alert unusual packets before anything too serious happens.</p>
<h4 id="kyc">KYC</h4>
<p>One area that has always been very paper based is bank account management (BAM) and know your customer (KYC). Since COVID-19 rendered face to face interaction and wet signatures with witnesses extremely difficult if not impossible, the industry has been faced with a deep quandary.</p>
<p>To their credit, it seems banks have started accepting most major forms of e-signature wherever possible. Of course, this is limited by local regulation, and thus dependent on regulator acceptance. Regulators have been slow to adapt to the ongoing digitisation, so wider KYC processes remained mired in paper.</p>
<p>Banks also struggle to digitise BAM processes in accordance with regulator mandated compliance procedures. Bankers and treasurers seem to have a shared frustration on this issue. Treasurers often cannot meet operational requirements. Bankers miss sales opportunities. With governments digitising furiously in other areas, one can only hope that financial regulators will feel pressure to wean themselves from their addiction to paper and ink.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>COVID-19 has presented treasurers, and indeed the industry as a whole, with myriad challenges. Responses have been varied and creative, adapting to corporate circumstances and ecosystems. It has definitely been a team effort across the industry as well as across corporate departments. It is good to see the industry pulling together in the face of this crisis.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body">
<h4 id="no-rest-for-treasury">No rest for treasury</h4>
<p>Treasurers are generally reporting that they are busier and more challenged than even during the global financial crisis – cash and liquidity are under the spotlight and these are core treasury responsibilities.</p>
<p>Working from home affects different people in different ways. Extroverts will miss social interaction. Introverts might love it – though there are reports of introverts bemoaning excess video conferencing. Some find their productivity boosted by avoiding office interruptions, others struggle with demanding small children no longer able to go to school.</p>
<p>Buffer.com surveyed 3,521 remote workers, and found more challenges than benefits with working from home.</p>
<p>Although people vary, there seems to be an emerging consensus on how best to manage working from home.</p>
<h4 id="time-management">Time management</h4>
<p>Remote working brings a release from the routine of nine to five. For some this is liberating, for others confusing. For some, the context shift to an office provided boundaries around their work day, and these are sorely missed at home – work overflows into breakfast and evenings, and maybe leisure and family overflow into the work day.</p>
<p>Most experts recommend routines and rituals to provide boundaries. From a time perspective, these can be modelled on in-office timings. From a location perspective, a dedicated work space is suggested where possible even if this cannot be a separate room.</p>
<p>Team members’ experience will vary. Some have children to attend to while lockdown closes schools. Different people have different temporal rhythms. Experience from in-office work can aid self-understanding.</p>
<p>Research shows that a majority of people benefit from doing thinking and big tasks in the morning while they are fresh, and doing emails and meetings in the afternoons. That of course depends on the overall cadence of the team.</p>
<p>Teams as a whole, as well as individuals, have to accept that productivity varies over time and that not every day will be super productive.</p>
<p>Teams need to negotiate a cadence for work and communication that suits best for all members. Where multiple time zones are involved, it is not realistic it is not realistic to expect colleagues to be available 24/7. Equally, team members need to respect others’ need for sleep, exercise, family time and so forth.</p>
<p>Individual time management for most requires boundaries in time and location, and routines like breaks. Book-ending days with a review and planning session – analogous to agile stand-ups – help many.</p>
<p>Prioritisation helps many overloaded people to focus on what matters. Determining the top three tasks for the next day at end of day can free team members from worry and distraction during their free (and sleep) time. Many people use task management solutions to similar effect.</p>
<h4 id="trust-and-communication">Trust and communication</h4>
<p>Trust is key for effective team work, and trust can be hard to foster even at the best of times. Trust requires clear communication and effective communication requires trust. These are even harder to maintain in lockdown.</p>
<p>Teams that have been together for a long time will probably be able to maintain trust longer in lockdown, but even the most cohesive teams need to nurture trust and communication. Colleagues will have very different experiences of remote working that will impact their emotions and their productivity. Teams require sensitivity to stay inclusive and maximise effectiveness.</p>
<p>Remote working increases ambiguity. When colleagues can just drop by to clarify matters, this is not a problem. When working remotely, “dropping by” is not possible, so teams need to make sure that understanding is clear. Clear goals and metrics are important in this context. Paraphrased responses help ascertain whether understanding is shared.</p>
<p>Given the probability of misunderstanding, it is important to assume positive intent. This can be made explicit in the team’s agreements on ways of working and cadence.</p>
<p>Team leaders will need to work harder to balance the team, for example, encouraging quieter colleagues to speak up and encouraging louder colleagues to listen respectfully. Team leaders can mitigate distance by organising short five-minute check-ins weekly to check how colleagues are doing and what if any support they need. However, such check-ins should be voluntary to avoid becoming oppressive.</p>
<p>Trust and communication have to be nurtured outside the team as well. For treasury, this can mean making more effort to communicate progress to internal counterparties as well as vendors, banks, rating agencies, investors and regulators.</p>
<h4 id="email-etiquette">Email etiquette</h4>
<p>The exponential tsunami of emails that comes from unthinking CC’s and forwarding is not a new problem. Corona lockdown will not in itself reduce email volumes, but it provides an opportunity to communicate more effectively via email.</p>
<p>As for meetings, it is important to restrict emails to actionable counterparties. Replies should avoid CYA and focus on value adding Intelligent use of the subject line, as used by the military, helps the recipient manage their inbox. The military practice of BLUF (bottom line up front) also helps recipients to determine quickly what may be required of them. BLUF is a short, staccato statement at the start of an email that summarises its message.</p>
<p>When the subject line headed with a clarifier like ACTION/DECISION/REQUEST/SIGN/INFO and a BLUF summary, recipients are better able to process their email using the OHIO (only handle it once) principle. More efficient inbox processing frees up time for productive work.</p>
<h4 id="managing-remote-meetings">Managing remote meetings</h4>
<p>Second to email, meetings have become a bane of office life, even before lockdown. Remote meetings can be even more challenging than face to face, and there has to be an effort to guard against a tendency to schedule even more meetings to mitigate the lack of in-person face time.</p>
<p>A good principle is to question whether a meeting is really needed. Agile style stand-ups and quick individual check-ins are better for keeping a team aligned and engaged. If a meeting is really required, apply the principle of “No agenda, no meeting”, and make sure the agenda makes clear the expected outcome of the meeting. Appoint someone – maybe in rotation – to track time during and outcomes of the meeting.</p>
<p>Keep meetings short and punchy. It seems the meme about post-internet humans having an attention span less than goldfish is dubious (and unfair to goldfish). But most people seem to lose focus when meetings exceed 45 minutes, so it is probably wise to break up meetings or at least provide regular coffee/stretch breaks.</p>
<p>Despite our intuition that seeing faces is more “real” or “natural”, there is evidence that video conferences are more stressful than audio, so consider carefully what is needed for each meeting – video conferencing is rarely necessary (and if so, keep it short), screen sharing is often less stressful (and consumes less bandwidth) than faces, and very often audio is effective and less tiring than video conferencing.</p>
<p>Inclusion is even more important in remote meetings than in face to face meetings. To avoid losing input from quieter team members, and to moderate the tendency for louder team members to dominate, use techniques like passing a (virtual) talking stick or brainstorming post-it sessions where everyone has to post their ideas. There are many virtual whiteboards and post-it solutions out there but they can be finickity, so consider video of a physical wall or board updated by a designated recorder.</p>
<h4 id="technology">Technology</h4>
<p>As explained and evidenced earlier, technology is mostly a poor substitute for face to face interaction. “Technology is great for transactions – but terrible for trust” (Jo Owen). Since remote working is the current reality, using communication technology effectively is important.</p>
<p>The distinction between synchronous and asynchronous channels is important. And whatever channels are used, it is critical to respect others’ time off – preferably based on team-wide agreements about cadence described above.</p>
<p>For many at home, data bandwidth can be an issue. Silicon Valley firms are apparently paying for employees to upgrade their home offices. Many companies may be less generous, and the maximum available bandwidth in some geographies may not be very fast. Teams have to work around the slowest link in their chain.</p>
<p>Most treasurers will follow corporate data security standards. It is still incumbent on individuals to follow best practice such as changing passwords frequently (and not writing them on post-its) as well as using 3FA when available (eg the sign-on apps from Microsoft Office and Google Suite).</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>Remote working as an ongoing reality presents new challenges to many treasuries. Although individual and team needs vary, the practices presented here can help many to increase their remote working productivity. Adaptive learning and sharing best practice is always helpful.</p>

<h4 id="ugly-duckling">Ugly duckling</h4>
<p>Sitting far from home, and with no idea when I might get there, it feels like a different world from where I wrote the last article. Everything has changed, it seems. And I was not prepared for this, more personally than professionally. I sometimes explain to people that being a treasurer is like being a professional worrier – “risk management” is less accessible than worry.</p>
<p>Sounds like a black swan, doesn’t it? Except plenty of people have been warning that a pandemic is a very pertinent risk, even though we got lucky with SARS and bird flu. This includes Professor Stephane Garelli at EuroFinance Geneva, whose two biggest worries were pandemic and cyber damage. (It’s probably fair to say that most of us, while quite alert to cyber fraud, are not ready for a protracted internet outage.)</p>
<p>The term “black swan” is applied unthinkingly to anything we did not see coming. But, as Alex Danco eloquently explained a couple of weeks ago, there are three aspects to black swans:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Unpredictable</strong>: a pandemic has long been predicted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Magnitude</strong>: even if we heard the warnings, we did not expect a major recession.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Retroactively explainable</strong>: we are still in this but we will probably find scapegoats reasonably soon.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="be-prepared">Be prepared</h4>
<p>The scout motto “be prepared” is quite close to my role as professional worrier. Of course, risk aversion frequently has a cost, and often next quarter’s results trump longer-term sustainability.</p>
<p>Sustainability implies things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Multisourcing rather than buying exclusively from the same cheapest supplier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making sure that suppliers and other business partners will be around when you need them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having enough staff to cover holidays and sickness coming together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paying for revolvers that seem unnecessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And so on…</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of this is seen as flab by many managers. Indeed, sustainability cannot be an excuse for inefficiencies like sloppy cash management and idle balances.</p>
<h4 id="supply-chain-finance-brittleness">Supply chain finance brittleness</h4>
<p>I have never got much traction with my concerns that supply chain finance can reduce supply chain resilience.</p>
<p>Buyers providing financial support to their suppliers either via third parties (banks and fintechs) or directly (dynamic discounting et al) are in normal times helping their whole supply chain. But in extremis, they risk a double whammy if both buyer and supplier (and even third party) find themselves liquidity constrained.</p>
<p>Of course, most procurement teams monitor the financial health of their suppliers, so hopefully this risk is not affecting supply chains too badly.</p>
<h4 id="real-world-recession">Real world recession</h4>
<p>Another novelty of the current situation is that the slowdown is in the real world, not just in finance. Worrying about the financial well-being of suppliers may be moot when staff cannot come to work and logistics are in lockdown.</p>
<p>A lot of money is needed to ensure jobless people do not starve and of course that has financial implications. On the other hand, unlike the previous crisis, this situation cannot be fixed with financial corrections. Collateral damage from the virus can be alleviated by fiscal means, but no amount of money can keep the economy running in lockdown.</p>

<h4 id="back-to-basics">Back to basics</h4>
<p>McKinsey has put cash front and centre of the CFO’s agenda: “the company’s primary finance focus during this period will be on implementing a ‘cash culture’.”</p>
<p>In fact, this virus is changing treasury in unexpected ways. The urgency of ensuring liquidity brings us back to basics and the core of treasury. Analysts say the majority of companies have three to six months of cash sustainability, so let’s hope we can exit lockdown within that time frame.</p>
<p>(On a personal level, being unable to return home might get less amusing if it lasts longer than that.)</p>
<p>In this situation, every dollar counts. Cash visibility and cash flow forecasting have become critical for survival. In that context, my two previous articles on best of breed and accessible technology remain relevant.</p>
<p>Treasurers stuck at home, if they any have time to spare, might want to consider BELLIN’s offer of free TMS if they are still doing treasury by Excel.</p>
<h4 id="surviving">Surviving</h4>
<p>This will be a period of dramatic change. We are already learning to work remotely. We are dealing with loneliness through video conferences and Zoom parties. In fact, the compensations for remote working are so effective that apparently some introverts are feeling overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Technology will step up both with remote working and automation. Hopefully treasury by Excel will be an early and little-mourned casualty of the virus.</p>
<p>Many businesses will fail. Hopefully this will create openings for new businesses to step into, rather than simply a reduction of economic activity as a whole.</p>
<p>There does seem to be a risk that larger companies will be better able to milk whatever cash governments are offering, leaving smaller businesses to die. This may be a threat to systemic resilience as well as to competition. In this view, the virus might accelerate the super profits of the world’s largest companies.</p>
<p>Sustainability in its broadest sense may carry more weight – at least for a while. This speaks for maintaining a thriving SME sector. It will be interesting to see how quickly we revert to maximum extraction mode.</p>
<h4 id="thriving">Thriving</h4>
<p>We can already see that Big Tech is thriving through this crisis. The shortage of liquidity and the difficulty of in-person communication will hamper start-ups, thus even further thinning Big Tech’s competitive space.</p>
<p>On the other hand, hard to predict changes brought by the virus may create opportunities for newcomers, both online and off. Maybe some business school professor will write a book called “Grey Ocean Strategy”, about filling niches left vacant by firms that proved insufficiently resilient to survive the virus.</p>
<p>Firms that have not felt motivated to digitise in the past are probably getting an intense lesson in priorities, now that face to face is no longer an option (and paper handling does not work well for people working from home). We can expect a major step up in digitisation worldwide. This will be good for the relevant providers, and will increase the general resilience of businesses. But the risk of cyber meltdown will become even more frightening.</p>
<h4 id="">Conclusion</h4>
<p>We find ourselves thrust into a strange new world. It is worth taking a deep breath and remembering the basics that remain immutable: liquidity is key and requires cash consciousness, the world is digitising even faster than before, and we need to organise for sustainability – a wide term which will hopefully come to include nurturing our planet as well as our businesses.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4 id="old-best-of-breed">Old best of breed</h4>
<p>In the past, treasury discussion of “best of breed” referred to the choice between dedicated TMS and the treasury modules of corporate ERP systems. Typically, treasury wanted best of breed TMSs, while the CFO and IT pushed for ERP solutions.</p>
<p>The arguments for using the same system across the corporation are strong enough that SAP seems to be gaining market share, despite being an order of magnitude more expensive than most current SaaS TMSs and having relatively limited sophistication. SAP treasury may have been helped in this by:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A weaker TMS market from the mid-noughties, as ION and FIS hoovered up TMS vendors and did not appear to do much with them (though more recently this consolidation has made space for current SaaS vendors like GTreasury and Kyriba which has ended up strengthening the market again).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concerns about cyber-security that strengthen IT’s argument for a common architecture they can better secure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Need for ever-stronger internal control over critical systems (though, in many ways, dedicated TMSs offer superior internal control over treasury operations).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="old-treasury-ecosystem">Old treasury ecosystem</h4>
<p>Of course, TMSs have always needed to interface with other systems for banking services, rate feeds, accounting and reporting.</p>
<p>Bank connectivity has traditionally been external software in most cases – either multi-bank services like SWIFT, Fides, TIS, or bank-specific solutions. Some old TMSs have in-house solutions (FIS has Trax and SAP has BCM) and most of the current SaaS generation offer “SWIFT in the box” (Kyriba and GTreasury) or equivalent built-in solutions (Fides for Reval). The functional boundaries are blurring as specialist bank connectivity providers offer increasingly sophisticated functionality (such as Fides and TIS) and on the other hand TMS vendors offer their relevant modules as bank connectivity solutions (Kyriba).</p>
<p>Rate feeds have always been separate because aggregating market data is far from the core competences of TMS and ERP vendors. Most corporates use rates from Refinitiv and Bloomberg, though many are turning for cost reasons to almost as good, if more limited, rate feeds for the eFX platforms (360T, Currenex, FXall, FXGO). Of course, minimal daily FX high-low close rates are available for free on the internet.</p>
<p>Treasury needs data from accounting systems, such as payables, to make payments and accounts receivable and accounts payables for cash flow forecasting. And treasury needs to send general ledger entries to accounting systems; some TMSs have accounting functionality but they tend to be used as sub-ledgers for treasury transactions only.</p>
<h4 id="trading-platforms">Trading platforms</h4>
<p>As FX trading has moved online over the past 20 years, eFX platforms, and increasingly eInvestment platforms, have become standard parts of the treasury ecosystem. Typically, eFX platforms like 360T, Currenex, FXall and FXGO have APIs to upload intended trades from TMSs and then to download completed trades back to TMSs. They also handle trade confirmation, replacing SWIFT Accord and MISys. As noted earlier, many treasuries take rate feeds from these platforms as well.</p>
<h4 id="new-best-of-breed">New best of breed</h4>
<p>Today, it seems that the best of breed concept is becoming more granular. There is some precedent for this – for example, the old Reval (before the merger with EcoFinance) was probably used more for hedge accounting than as a general purpose TMS. But now, regulations like MiFID and the need for higher accuracy and greater productivity are driving treasurers to search for best of breed solutions in ever more specialised domains, like forecasting, reporting, hedging, compliance and so forth. The increasing prevalence of APIs makes stitching together diverse specialised solutions much easier, and, where legacy systems do to not have APIs, treasurers can use robotic process automation (RPA) instead.</p>
<h4 id="cash-flow-forecasting">Cash flow forecasting</h4>
<p>Traditional TMSs have supported cash flow forecasting primarily as data aggregators and consolidators. TMSs mainly assist with workflow to collect and consolidate subsidiary or business unit forecasts, possibly with some analytical support – such as comparing forecasts with previous forecasts and actuals. This has been helpful for treasurers but leaves open the critical issue of where the underlying forecast comes from.</p>
<p>Today, fintechs such as Cashforce, CashAnalytics and Analyste are harnessing big data and machine learning (ML) or, more prosaically but equally effectively, statistics, to actually generate raw forecasts. As yet this kind of functionality is not available in most TMSs – though some can handle seasonality and other simple heuristics.</p>
<p>For treasuries seeking to improve the reliability of cash flow forecasts and reduce the related workload both within treasury and at subsidiaries, this technology is well worth the cost and effort of implementation.</p>
<h4 id="reporting">Reporting</h4>
<p>Most current TMSs have some kind of dashboarding solutions and report generators. In many cases, the latter have such low usability that treasuries feel obliged to pay vendors to create new reports for them. This is not only expensive, but also neither sustainable nor flexible.</p>
<p>Another issue is that treasurers often want to disseminate information beyond treasury. Getting the CFO and other interested parties to learn to use the TMS dashboard (or even to remember a TMS password for occasional use) is a stretch.</p>
<p>Because of these issues, many treasuries are using business intelligence (BI) solutions – typically whatever is the corporate standard for dashboarding and reporting – to share treasury information within and without treasury.</p>
<p>Typical BI solutions include Microsoft Power BI, SAP Business Objects, IBM TM1 and so forth. Power BI is especially popular because it is included in Microsoft Office, which makes it effectively “free” (at least the basic functionality) for most treasurers. If none of those appeal, check out <a href="http://thoughtspot.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">thoughtspot.com</a>.</p>
<h4 id="hedging">Hedging</h4>
<p>As FX volatility increases and compliance constraints tighten, many treasurers feel the need to optimise their hedging strategies. Large treasuries have been doing hedge optimisation for decades, but typically this required using Mathematica or MatLab on the side, and the skills to use them.</p>
<p>The market has responded to this gap with solutions dedicated to FX hedging. One example is FiREapps, which was acquired by Kyriba in 2019, but is still available as an independent solution.</p>
<h4 id="compliance">Compliance</h4>
<p>Derivatives reporting requirements such as European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) have brought compliance requirements for treasuries that cannot easily be met by TMS native functionality. Some treasurers have integrated specialised trade reporting solutions to meet these requirements.</p>
<h4 id="kyc-and-bam">KYC and BAM</h4>
<p>Many TMSs and some bank connectivity solutions provide BAM functionality as a system of record, but automating KYC and other AML requirements remains challenging.</p>
<p>SWIFT announced in 2019 that their KYC registry will be open to corporates – it was previously restricted to financial institutions. Some treasurers have had success with <a href="http://KYC.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">KYC.com</a>.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>As treasury “mash ups” become more common in the search for greater efficiency and accuracy and compliance, treasurers need to become familiar with the intricacies of dealing with APIs.</p></div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading">Optimising working capital through treasury transformation</h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>In today’s uncertain macroeconomic environment, companies have more reason than ever to focus on optimising working capital. At the same time, treasurers are increasingly focusing on centralisation structures such as in-house banks to achieve working capital improvements. HSBC’s Andrew Wild, Head of Commercial Banking Europe, Deputy CEO HSBC France, explains how companies are approaching these challenges – and what steps HSBC is taking to support customers in Europe in the current climate.</em></p>
<h4>How important are working capital improvements to your customers in the current economic climate?</h4>
<p>In the current economic climate, issues such as increased trade tensions, low interest rates, social unrest in some countries around the world and continuing uncertainties around Brexit are of particular concern as treasurers look at how they are managing their cash.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, we are acutely aware that our clients are placing considerable focus on working capital improvements. From airlines to luxury goods companies, many different sectors are having to manage reduced margins while looking for opportunities for greater efficiency within their operations. As such, working capital is increasingly seen as a key indicator of companies’ sound management profitability. Certainly when we talk to treasurers, working capital is a topic that is foremost in their minds.</p>
<h4>How are companies approaching this task?</h4>
<p>Working capital is an area that involves a lot of moving parts. Where treasurers are concerned, the main focus is on reducing days sales outstanding (DSO) and increasing days payable outstanding (DPO) in order to improve the cash conversion cycle without impacting sales growth or disrupting the supply chain.</p>
<p>Corporates can improve working capital in a number of ways. From a DPO point of view, companies might in the past have achieved this by processing payments late, or by negotiating one-sided pricing with some of their smaller suppliers. But today, I think there is a realisation – certainly within the larger corporate space – that this is unsustainable. Companies are therefore looking for innovative solutions to increase DPO, while at the same time supporting their supplier bases.</p>
<p>Some companies achieve this by adopting supplier financing, but what we are also now seeing is an increased focus on corporate card programmes. Many companies that are talking to their suppliers about offering earlier payment than they would normally receive are looking into the use of purchase card schemes, as these enable buyers to pay suppliers immediately while extending DPO. Clients are increasingly asking us what terms we offer on our card programme and how far out we can go to help them manage their working capital more effectively.</p>
<p>Companies are also looking at opportunities to reduce DSO, which is the time taken to convert sales orders into cash. In the past, treasury teams focused on the balances of accounts in order to manage their cash flow. But increasingly, with better data from payment systems and a greater understanding from banks that data is a key driver for corporates, we are seeing more focus on segmentation – in other words, products that can segment customer receivables in different ways.</p>
<p>With virtual accounts, for example, specific customers are allocated a dedicated bank account number. This means that any cash that goes into the virtual account can be posted automatically into the accounts receivable ledger. As a result, credit control teams no longer need to spend hours of their time trying to match outstanding invoices to payments received, but can focus on more value added tasks such as managing slow payers.</p>
<p>Indeed, one of our clients was able to reduce DSO from 60 days to 48 days by implementing such a solution. This freed up a significant amount of capital, and also meant they could carry out better investigations and credit checks on new customers, as well as more effectively chase slow payers.</p>
<h4>Should companies be looking at both sides of this equation at the same time?</h4>
<p>Absolutely. When companies are looking at working capital, DSO, DPO and other activities that are all happening at the same time, there is no point in focusing only on purchases if your sales organisation isn’t also focusing on collecting the cash as it comes in.</p>
<p>Another important consideration is the need to improve visibility on cash balances. Real-time balance information can enable treasury teams to focus on where they are right now, how they can invest surplus cash, and whether or not they have short-term borrowing requirements that need to be met. This might mean using banks’ liquidity management portals that can drill down into cash concentration structures. Or it might mean taking advantage of automated investment solutions, whereby surplus cash can be automatically invested and taken off the balance sheet to reduce counterparty risk, while also maximising returns.</p>
<h4>Treasury transformation is often positioned as a means of improving a corporate’s working capital. To what extent are your corporate customers engaged in this journey, and what are they looking to achieve?</h4>
<p>Centralisation via treasury transformation is still the most prevalent topic for the clients I speak to in Europe. Even big multinationals often feel that there is still scope for them to achieve a greater level of centralisation. We’re also seeing considerable focus on this topic from our large corporate and middle market customers, whether they are regional or have disparate business units within a particular country. These companies are now looking to centralise – whether that means putting in place a cash overlay solution to minimise idle cash, or setting up a full-blown in-house bank solution along the lines of the structures used by very large corporations.</p>
<p>The centralisation process allows companies to review their own internal systems and processes. They then look to the banks to complete this process, in some cases by achieving greater integration through their payments or receivables. The main objectives are really to enhance visibility, streamline processes and build efficiencies within the working capital cycle. That is really what the focus tends to be on this centralisation journey.</p>
<p>While it feels like this topic has been around for quite some time, the level of maturity within conversations with our clients is very striking. Some clients have carried out a lot of work over the last five years and have moved to a highly centralised regional or global treasury centre arrangement with an in-house bank.</p>
<p>These companies may have very sophisticated setups, but at the other end of the spectrum there are those that are just starting out on this journey. For these companies, there are plenty of challenges to consider – not least of all the need to get the whole company behind them for what really is quite a fundamental business change. This isn’t just a change to the treasury system, which might be contained to treasury, and perhaps the finance department. It is something that affects the whole company, including business heads, treasury, finance, procurement, operations, sales and distribution functions. So the topic is broad and there is a lot to consider – but there is also a lot of opportunity for companies to get started on that journey.</p>
<h4>Do companies tend to work their way up the centralisation ladder one step at a time, or do some set their sights on implementing an in-house bank from the outset?</h4>
<p>We see examples of both approaches. A lot of it is down to the appetite within the broader leadership structure and the level of risk that the company is willing to take at the time. I was speaking to a client a few weeks ago, and they wanted to focus on basic connectivity in the first instance before looking into a payment factory solution – they were not ready to look at other parts of the puzzle yet.</p>
<p>They may equally look to tackle their risk management by centralising their FX exposure and no longer have their business units managing foreign currency transactions at the local level. Even if they are not putting in place an in-house bank, companies may centralise their liquidity in order to have better visibility and access over cash. As a result, they can manage their liquidity more effectively. This might mean using solutions such as notional pooling, which enable companies to offset short-term working capital deficiencies within a certain currency against long positions in other currencies, rather than having to do costly foreign exchange swaps and hedging processes.</p>
<p>Generally companies that do want to aim for a highly centralised structure in the longer term may engage in a phased approach defining intermediary milestones. The question is how much treasuries can afford to do at this point in time and how much they are willing to disrupt in one go, particularly given the continuing uncertainties in today’s macroeconomic environment. This level of uncertainty and volatility has to be factored in when companies are looking at making significant changes to how they receive or make payments.</p>
<h4>How can companies use these types of centralisation structures to support their working capital initiatives?</h4>
<p>Bringing all these things in-house, reducing the number of bank partners and potentially reducing the number of accounts, without necessarily adopting a full payments on behalf of (POBO)/receivables on behalf of (ROBO) virtual accounts structure, really does help treasury teams manage their working capital more effectively. As a result, they may be able to fund legal entities that would otherwise require expensive overdraft solutions with a non-core bank.</p>
<p>Bringing all of that into play also adds to a company’s purchasing power. If you have one or two regional or global banks, your purchasing power with those core banks will be much better than if you have 56 banks and 300 accounts.</p>
<p>Typically with treasury transformation, companies will also see a level of IT change, which may bring opportunities to drive further efficiencies, increase automation and move away from spreadsheets. All of these factors can help you gain better visibility over where you are in your working capital cycle, where your stock is and who your debtors are.</p>
<p>So the IT change that goes along with treasury transformation is one component. Another is functional change, which may include procurement and finance as well as treasury. It is not just treasury that is centralising – it is often a lot of the processes that are driven or supported by other functions. The end result is a better line of sight over what is going on.</p>
<h4>What challenges do your corporate customers face in implementing efficient working capital solutions?</h4>
<p>Most important is the need for senior management alignment. There is no point in a treasury team coming up with a fantastic procure-to-pay project, only to realise that IT doesn’t have the necessary resources for the next two years. Likewise, it’s easy to assume that companies will have a defined vision of where they want to be – but in reality, different functions may have different ideas about what they want to be doing in two years’ time.</p>
<p>Strong senior management alignment/sponsorship can certainly help that. Some companies now have working capital committees that can look both at the indicators and at the underlying business below those indicators. We are also seeing a big inflection point for some companies that are growing either through acquisition or through organic growth. These companies may have reached a certain point in terms of their growth and revenue, but in order to grow to the next level they will require further budget and resources, to streamline their organisation and create efficiencies This is where that senior management drive is needed to get the whole organisation pulling in the same direction.</p>
<h4>What approach is HSBC taking to support corporate customers in Europe and how are customers benefiting from your investments in European hubs?</h4>
<p>For one thing, we have looked to ensure that our clients are given Brexit-proof solutions. While many of our clients have historically been headquartered out of London, in the last few years we have seen a number looking to move their treasury centres out of London as well. We have therefore built out our hubs in the locations these treasury centres are moving to, including France, Ireland and the Netherlands. We have made sure clients can have the same experience in those markets by investing in technology, solutions and talent.</p>
<p>There is no point in having different solutions in different markets, so we have also focused on standardised connectivity. This includes the ability to produce XML files through host-to-host connectivity or through SWIFT. Another area that is getting more and more interest from corporates is the use of APIs – which comes back to the observation that corporates don’t always want to do everything in one go. Some are dipping their toes into being able to access real-time information through their treasury management solutions. Online banking portals can also now provide real-time data that is crucial when it comes to driving decision-making at the tactical and strategic level.</p>
<p>Likewise, SWIFT gpi is making it possible for customers to find out the status of where a particular payment is. We are building that out so that clients can see this information through our digital channels. At this stage, SWIFT gpi is predominantly for outbound payments – but in the future, SWIFT is planning to add information about receivables, which is something that will be of real benefit for treasurers. Knowing when high value payments are likely to hit their accounts will make it easier for treasurers to use those funds effectively. So gpi is definitely going to be a key driver for our treasury teams going forward.</p>
<p>Efficient liquidity management will also impact effective working capital management and is within the bailiwick of treasurers. The ability to manage short-term FX flows can be managed actively or passively within our hubs. We have standardised cut off times and also worked to ensure that liquidity is available for FX settlements and processes. Treasurers are also reviewing passive management by reviewing notional pooling options which again we have made available in most of our hubs.</p>
<p>Last but not least when it comes to working capital optimisation, we have implemented a state-of-the-art Corporate Cards proposition and will continue to invest in the coming months to bring our customers more features and functionalities.</p></div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h3 id="expensive-bloat">Expensive bloat</h3>
<p>Despite the current generation of software as a service (SaaS) treasury management and speedy implementation, it can be hard for small treasuries to build a business case for acquiring a treasury management system (TMS), especially if they plan only to use a subset of features – as would be the case if the problem to be solved is cash visibility, for example.</p>
<p>Old fashioned installed TMSs can cost millions to acquire, the same again to implement, and 20% per annum to maintain. Current generation SaaS systems charge per user per month which is often easier to cover with tight treasury budgets.</p>
<p>Internal costs – ie how much treasury staff time is required to implement – can also be an unacceptable drain on thin resources. So it helps that SaaS TMSs are often implemented in weeks, instead of months and even years for traditional systems.</p>
<h3 id="narrowing-the-scope">Narrowing the scope</h3>
<p>Cash visibility is a good example of a specific tactical need for which a full treasury management system may be overkill. Another alternative is to use bank connectivity vendors such as TIS and Fides. And, of course, many treasuries use SWIFT to connect with their banks. For treasuries that have the connectivity in place or distributed, and who want to integrate flow data from internal systems, data warehouse and business intelligence tools like Power-BI can be an attractive alternative.</p>
<p>(To be fair, some of the SaaS providers are successfully selling their solutions as cash visibility tools, leveraging their expertise in bank connectivity. SaaS TMSs normally include bank connectivity ‘in the box’ ie implemented in the cloud so users do not have to do the work.)</p>
<h3 id="business-intelligence">Business intelligence</h3>
<p>Business intelligence platforms such as Power-BI allow treasurers to integrate cash visibility data in the way they want and to distribute it across authorised colleagues with ease. They are designed for users rather than IT professionals, which means treasurers who are comfortable with Excel can generally create the solutions they want.</p>
<p>As a bonus Power-BI specifically is “free” – it is included in Microsoft Office for which most treasurers are licenced. (Though, as I found to my disappointment, it is not available for MacOS – I suppose Microsoft does not expect financial types to be using Apple kit.)</p>
<p>It has been heartening to hear several case studies recently of treasuries building their own cash visibility solutions as well as related solutions for cash flow forecasting.</p>
<h3 id="getting-the-data-right">Getting the data right</h3>
<p>Although Power-BI is most recognisable as a data visualisation tool, it also has powerful and easy-to-use data integration capabilities. One case study involved automating the collection of bank statements delivered to a specified folder and then processing them into a common homogenised database.</p>
<p>Treasurers were able to import flat file formats like comma separated values (CSV, which is how Excel exports data for consumption by text-based software), MT490 (SWIFT’s legacy format), and BAI (an old American flat file format). This means that, so long as the bank statement download is automated, the aggregation and homogenisation of data can also be automated.</p>
<p>Under the covers, and offering greater flexibility when needed, Microsoft uses the M engine and language to import data and DAX to manipulate data once it is in the Tabular database.</p>
<p>Once the data is imported into a consistent database, different users can view and query the data in any way that helps them – so long as they have appropriate access rights of course. We used to call these data warehouses but now they seem to be data lakes and even data oceans. No doubt we will also move on from data cubes to data multiverses sometime soon.</p>
<h3 id="self-service-and-live-presentations">Self-service and live presentations</h3>
<p>“Everybody hates PowerPoint” – right? Especially the poor souls who have to build the daily treasury reporting package with an epic struggle of dodgy formulae and copy-pasting.</p>
<p>Power-BI and its ilk obviate the pain of PowerPoint. People who need the data self-serve – they connect to the data and slice and dice as they wish, within the constraints of their access rights of course.</p>
<p>Presentations become dynamic rather then static. If someone asks the presenter a question, they can drill down into or re-format the data on the fly to find answers, rather than scrolling to slide number 345 or saying, “I will have to get back to you on that (with another deck!)”. This creates a spirit of enquiry that makes for much more interesting meetings.</p>
<h3 id="excel-killer">Excel killer</h3>
<p>While Excel is great for experimenting with numbers, it should never be used for operation processes (like regular reporting). It cannot handle large data sets, it cannot connect data, it has no audit trail and no access control.</p>
<p>The nature of copy-pasting data into Excel and then relying on fragile links and formulae to massage the data is extremely error prone and therefore very dangerous for treasury processes.</p>
<p>Power-BI and its ilk are built to handle large data sets, to keep them secure, and to connect them.</p>
<p>Further, whereas Excel produces generally static output (except for pivot table whizzes), Power-BI visualisation is intrinsically dynamic – not just pivot tables made fast and easy but also visual rather than tabular.</p>
<p>Power-BI is capable of much more sophisticated and attractive charts than Excel and has built-in time series ‘intelligence’. Rather than emailing Excel files, Power-BI analytics are published on the cloud and automatically remain live as data changes.</p>
<p>Of course, such published analyses are intrinsically multi-user and provide an ideal platform for collaboration.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Business intelligence tools are finally heralding the post-Excel era in treasury, and opening up a wide user-driven solution space. Change has been slow in coming but this is starting to have a meaningful impact on treasury productivity.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>One of the most powerful forces at play in today’s world is innovation. It is in the journeys that companies and industries undergo; transforming themselves to be able to survive, compete, and stay at the top of their game, where we witness the power of this force. However, no matter how innovative companies may become, there is one thing they will always need: customers. This is where a true leader will identify the qualities required to leverage their innovative capabilities and bring their customers with them on the journey, to achieve greater things!</p>
<p>The term, leader, possesses many connotations when examined in different contexts. It is probably wise to make a distinction between the qualities required to be (i) a leader of a team and (ii) a leader of a product or service in your industry. I believe the quote by Steve Jobs refers to the role he played in leading his industry to revolutionise the technology domain and build the World’s Most Admired Company (Fortune, 2019).</p>
<p>There is no question that innovation played an integral role in distinguishing Steve Jobs from others. Yet, when we examine the term “follower” alongside the term “leader”, we tend to place negative connotations upon it. More specifically, in commerce, we tend to view a “follower” as someone or a group that is behind a leader in their industry or sector, and therefore must be failing, inadequate or unsuccessful. Today, for the first time in the evolution of our planet, it is possible for organisations to take a leap by embracing the technology and change that will catapult their departments/companies into the future. In some cases, this leap involves learning to follow a tried and tested path. For who would become the leaders, if they were not first the followers?</p>
<p>There is no shame in following a proven or successful solution invented by another company, even a potential competitor. After all, isn’t that what business is about?</p>
<p>Let’s consider one of the world’s largest companies: Amazon. They track the products that are most successful on their platform then sell it themselves; this is the most crude form of ‘following’ the lead of others!</p>
<p>A paradigm shift has occurred in organisations. Those who are followers may assume leadership roles and those who are leaders can take followership roles and this can prove to be a transforming force within organisations. Yet, this can only happen when leaders and followers become involved in a symbiotic relationship. We must start viewing leaders and followers as processes rather than positions in which both leaders and followers collaborate with integrity, commitment and shared purpose to bring success and vibrancy to an organisation.</p>
<p>I am not saying that innovation is a bad thing, however, not everyone is an innovator, and therefore, not every leader is innovative. The power of this interdependent relationship allows followers to develop qualities an accomplished leader should display and allows leaders to develop the qualities a successful follower should display. Often, people become great leaders through the process of teaching, learning, and observation. The truth is that the role of one is not greater than the other, and both contribute to organisational effectiveness. The key is identifying your strengths and playing to them!</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Dealing with substantial change can be very difficult. In today’s globally connected society, people and companies have more access to information than ever before. With this influx of information, however, comes the potential for radical change. Oftentimes, people and companies are resistive to adapting when faced with unfavourable obstacles. In these uncertain situations, it is crucial to take the late Steve Jobs’ thinking to acknowledge that change can be positive and be used to your advantage. The best companies are always proactive when it comes to change and never rely on the ‘easy’ path; rather, they continuously seek innovation on all fronts.</p>
<p>In an ever-increasingly digital world, it is imperative to explore and adopt new technologies to innovate where time and resources may not be in your favour. The leaders that choose to embrace the inevitable change and obstacles today are the ones that will ultimately be remembered as pioneers and disruptors of tomorrow.</p>
<p>Given the ominous nature of the situation GE was presented with at the outset of the plan for US$20bn in dispositions, it was crucial to take Jobs’ thinking and put it into action. We know dealing with substantial change is often very difficult and that the best companies seek innovation on all fronts, and this is especially true in an industry like trade finance that has been, and continues to be, intensely paper driven in an increasingly digital world.</p>
<p>In GE’s case, it was absolutely critical for the company’s survival at a time where no other solution was available in the marketplace. GE’s adoption of new technologies and advanced analytics shows how innovation can overcome challenges where time and resources may not be in your favour. We are proud to be pioneers and disruptors in this field, and hope that as more companies take on similar challenges, the trade finance industry can separate itself as innovative leaders in the treasury space.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Treasury is rightly centred on risk management. Borne out of countless market meltdowns and funding crunches over the decades, it’s about ensuring the business has enough funding and liquidity to grow whilst managing downside risks. The goal is to ensure the business stays afloat, even in the most volatile interest rate and currency markets. This risk averse culture and ‘governance’ mindset sees treasury tightly controlling bank account opening and payment processes – all of which makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>However, this has led to a strong tendency to hire lots of accounting and finance types into treasury. The result is that many treasuries lack the forward-looking technology skills required to support the transformative changes that many businesses are going through today.</p>
<p>For decades, business models and the financial services that supported them have changed very slowly. This enabled treasuries to stay on top of changes and effectively fulfil their role of supporting the business with new financial services relatively easily. Run an RFP every three to five years for services like cash management and you were done!</p>
<p>Now businesses are under huge pressure to digitise and transform their business models with a whole set of different financial demands and services required, for example, new online sites with dynamic FX management and payment gateways to support ‘direct to customer’ sales channels. They don’t have time to wait for treasury to come up with the answers and often engage directly with fintechs who are agile and quick to respond to their needs. As a result, business increasingly bypasses treasury to source new financial services. This creates a headache for the treasurer who is left trying to manage the liquidity and risk aspects of these new solutions after the fact.</p>
<p>In response, some forward-looking treasuries have started hiring their own software engineers and data scientists. They can now proactively ask ‘What do you need?’ instead of ‘Why haven’t you consulted us?’</p>
<p>Treasurers need to be more like Steve Jobs and lead innovation on the financial services available to support the business as opposed to operating on a ‘business as usual’ basis. In other words, most treasurers still exist within the old ‘Nokia’ defined universe of services rather than looking towards the availability of new ‘iPhone’-like services. It’s now a question of how to innovate and keep pace with an increasingly digital world and growing customer expectations.</p>
<p>Equipped with this knowledge, treasurers can proactively advise and support the business with the new services required. But how do you get there? The first is diversifying the talent pool within treasury to include more people with strong technology backgrounds. The second is embracing change by upskilling the knowledge of the entire team. Connecting with forward-thinking banks and major fintechs to learn about what is happening in the market. The third is engaging with the business on the changes that are impacting them and bringing the knowledge treasury has acquired to the table.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>In trade finance, today’s early adopters of fintech propositions will become tomorrow’s role models. Fintechs offer banks various opportunities to innovate in trade finance, with or without blockchain! As fintechs are now viewed as partners more than competitors, I believe that it is the time for established trade banks to place their bets as they seek to position themselves as leaders rather than followers.</p>
<p>Much has been said about the notion of ‘fintech disruption’. About five years ago, emerging technology companies identified as ‘fintechs’ were often seen as attempting to create the next wave of competition, fighting established financial institutions (FIs). Roll forward to 2019 and we can see that this largely negative tide has turned.</p>
<p>If there is to be any disruption, it is now generally accepted that it won’t be driven by those highly specialised technologists per se. On the contrary, recent fintech news reports many ‘bank – fintech’ adoption contracts. If anything, this shows banks are finally recognising the value brought by these agile innovators to their own business models and strategic objectives.</p>
<p>From my own perspective, from the trade finance space, fintechs are bringing highly specialised offerings that differentiate drastically in approach versus the traditional software development model. Based on their key characteristics we can see that fintechs:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Are laser focused on specific segments and value propositions; they often become the best at it, at least when they don’t get distracted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are very agile and will consider their early adopters as partners in their product development roadmap; co-design becomes the norm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are best positioned to take advantage of recent technologies whilst caring about the need to integrate seamlessly with banks’ legacy systems; co-existence with banks’ internal systems is a top priority and a no-brainer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes operate common communications or trading platforms and are therefore creating new eco-systems for financial institutions, their clients and/or funders; platforms often become new sales/distribution channels for banks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are not biased by legacy revenues (eg software license fees) and technology models (eg traditional messaging versus APIs) – they want to demonstrate their value add in the fastest and most cost-efficient way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Want to prove themselves by facilitating adoption without forcing their clients to take a CapEx decision (eg software license acquisition); this drastically reduces risks for early adopters.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As a consequence, partnering with fintechs can bring many benefits to transaction banks, their clients and their investors. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Short time to market thanks to use of cloud-based platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-intrusive technologies ensuring seamless integration with existing systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Low set-up cost and usage-based running cost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimal user experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continuously and fast evolving feature sets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strategic enablers for banks to participate in eco-systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best at combining legal and business expertise with latest technologies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Trade banks which don’t grasp the fintech opportunity quickly will face intense competition from new FIs entering the market which are ready to find ways to benefit from the fintechs, to differentiate and to gain market share. This can only serve to benefit corporate treasurers.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><h4 id="resilience-from-the-shark-pool">Resilience from the shark pool</h4>
<p>Wandering around Innotribe in a quiet moment, I came across <a href="https://www.pauldegelder.com/" target="_blank">Paul de Gelder</a> explaining how he got over losing half his limbs in a shark attack in Sydney Harbour – not only recovering and thriving but also applying his personal resilience to campaigning for planetary resilience. He definitely put into perspective the normal issues we treasurers think of when discussing overcoming challenges.</p>
<h4 id="payments">Payments</h4>
<p>With faster payments progressing at different speeds around the globe, payments were naturally high on the agenda. The Bank of England will be rolling out its <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/payment-and-settlement/rtgs-renewal-programme" target="_blank">next generation payment platform</a> over the next few years. They have left DLT for the next upgrade cycle. Their RTGS vision includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Increased resilience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strengthened end-to-end security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved user functionality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wider interoperability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Greater access.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is interesting that two big themes surface in the Bank of England vision. First: resilience, which is clearly a prime responsibility of central banks and regulators everywhere. Second: access, which echoes the open banking being promoted across the Eurozone and elsewhere. At some level there is a tension between the two, because superficially, at least, more open systems can be more vulnerable.</p>
<p>This tension was a major theme at Sibos, engendering sessions on a wide array of topics, from securing APIs to new forms of biometrics, harder encryption, and training. We even had a session on secure coding for non-coders that was very enlightening.</p>
<p>It seems that the technology is reasonably robust and the bug bounty programmes keep the code security abreast with hacker’s creativity, so the big risk is the wetware. As one panellist put it: “Every organisation has their ‘Dave’” – the person who uses their birthday as a password and clicks on phishing links.</p>
<p>It’s not just errant Luddites who pose a threat. One panellist cited statistics showing that only 3% of banks have activated multi-factor authentication. That is truly shocking, if correct.</p>
<h4 id="cacophony-of-payments">Cacophony of payments</h4>
<p>Solving these issues will require plenty of experimentation. Corporates lament the complexity and diversity we already face when faster payments co-exist with legacy batch systems, not to mention wallets and various mobile solutions like Zelle (a bank created counter to Venmo in the USA). Each one of these has different APIs and file formats as well as different cut-offs (or none) and operating parameters.</p>
<p>For most, this diversity of payment rails represents a challenge impeding centralised straight through processing of large payable volumes. To some, diversity is a business opportunity in so far as solution providers who can mask the complexity can present valuable services. Yet others accept diversity as a reality that must be handled to ensure the widest possible access for their products and services.</p>
<p>One panellist opined that there will be two (cross-border) payment rails in the (unspecified) future – one for China and one for the rest of the world. But most agreed that the near-term promises much more diversity than harmonisation. Even within the relatively coherent confines of the Eurozone, it seems that every bank is creating its own API formats and processes. Meanwhile in the USA, a bank consortium called The Clearing House (THC) is slugging it out with the Fed to determine the future of faster payments; THC is already live while the Fed has deep research into market needs.</p>
<p>Ultimately payments need to become free as email has become, and indeed as are retail payments in many markets. An interesting anecdote from the early years of TransferWise was that the best price they could get from the GBP clearers was £1.30 per payment; they became the first clearing member of the Bank of England and dropped their cost of GBP clearing to £0.03 (three pennies) thereby enabling even cheaper customer transfers.</p>
<h4 id="cross-border-payments">Cross border payments</h4>
<p>Ripple was back (and on stage) at Sibos – they ran their own competing event called Swell for a couple of years – indicating that SWIFT now feels sufficiently confident of GPI’s robustness. One panellist described cross border payments as two domestic payments with FX in between – which is basically how Ripple treats it (although it is now trying to squeeze RPX into the middle).</p>
<p>There were many cross-border ACH service providers at Sibos this year – entities that put their own domestic bank accounts at the service of their customers to enable them to offer cheaper cross-border payments to their customers in turn, thereby avoiding the cost and complexity of the four corner correspondent banking model.</p>
<p>Cross-border ACH addresses the price issue with cross border payments – that they are too expensive. Cross-border ACH costs between zero and US$1 per payment and generally arrive same day and in many cases within minutes, depending on the local ACH used. Cross-border ACH normally uses domestic low value systems and many of these cap the value of payments, which precludes their use for high value treasury payments. Nonetheless, the technology is finding broad adoption within its niche.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.swift.com/our-solutions/swift-gpi" target="_blank">SWIFT’s gpi</a> addresses several problems with cross border payments – notably speed and obfuscation – by enforcing a rule book for cross-border payments which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fast (within 24 hours).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trackable (GPI tracker).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transparent (all fees advised upfront).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete (no more data truncation).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>GPI will be mandatory for all 10,000 or so SWIFT member banks in 2020, and this will certainly improve treasury operations. SWIFT intends to continue to address issues that have come from its corporate advisory group including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Instant international payments and 24/7.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pre-validation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pay and trace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inbound tracking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Request to pay.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A strength of GPI is that it builds on the existing and well-worn four corner correspondent model so that it accesses the extensive coverage of SWIFT’s 10,000 or so member banks. Correspondent banking also brings weaknesses. The correspondent banking model consumes large amounts of precious bank liquidity – a common bank heuristic is that the liquidity required for cross-border payments is 60% of the daily volume. Another issue is that tightening AML and KYC enforcement has made big holes in correspondent relationships.</p>
<p>Ripple is more efficient from a liquidity perspective, and this benefit may well offset its relatively limited coverage compared to GPI.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>Payments are progressing rapidly. With diverse use cases searching for solutions and a variety of providers providing solutions, payments will become more heterogenous in the near future. The landscape may only simplify when government institutions like central banks decide that free, ‘anywhere anytime’ payments are a public good – after all, payments are a more obvious common good than many things governments currently provide to their citizens.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>Last year most blockchain pundits confidently predicted that the first widespread application of blockchain in treasury would be in trade. This year all the news is about digital coins on industrial grade stablecoins, backed by real money assets. Could this be an inflection point?</em></p>
<h4 id="a-taxonomy-of-coins">A taxonomy of coins</h4>
<p>Bitcoin is no doubt the reason that the term ‘coins’ has arisen. After all, Bitcoin is the founding father of cryptocurrencies and the implementation that brought distributed ledger technology (DLT) to public awareness.</p>
<p>Since the formation of bitcoin, DLTs have evolved from permission-less DLTs, where no one is in control and anyone can set up a node, to permissioned DLTs, where only approved parties can run nodes on the DLT.</p>
<p>From a money perspective, bitcoin is an example of a new currency. It is not pegged to, nor dependent upon, any fiat currencies or commodities.</p>
<p>To mitigate the extreme volatility of bitcoin and the like (so-called “V-Coins”), the market has developed stablecoins which are backed by some other assets – normally fiat currency, commodities, financial assets, and even other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Last year Venezuela launched the ‘Petro’ – a cryptocurrency backed by its oil reserves in order to get around sanctions. Gold-based virtual currencies have also been tried over the past few decades. J.P. Morgan’s JPM Coin is pegged to US dollar (USD), while Facebook’s Libra is backed by a basket of high-quality liquid assets in various large economy currencies. Central banks are also studying issuing digital fiat currency as coins on a DLT or otherwise. The ones that are likely to be most relevant for treasurers are Stablecoins, Fiatcoins, and Digital fiat currency.</p>
<h4 id="stablecoins">Stablecoins</h4>
<p>Facebook Libra is an example of a Stablecoin and an intriguing prospect for treasurers. Unlike JPM Coin, which is at its heart the USD in a new form, Libra is a brand new currency.</p>
<p>For treasurers, Libra could indeed be a safe middle currency between competing currency blocks which are likely to become even more volatile due to ongoing trade wars and economic uncertainty.</p>
<p>Libra will also be properly distributed from its independent ruling association and across hundreds of partners. This will make Libra more robust than a single point database (as intended in the design of DLT) and also create a deeper ecosystem to add value to Libra with different services. Libra is a multi-asset DLT and its ability to handle multiple asset types will open up some interesting trade opportunities.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, governments and central banks are currently taking a very negative view of Libra,due to the current distrust of big tech and central bank change resistance. This is a pity because it is a golden opportunity to make Facebook give back to society by paying for this grand experiment while regulating Libra tightly (bank regulation plus), especially as central banks are also looking at what they call a synthetic hegemonic currency (SHC) as a replacement for the USD.</p>

<h4 id="fiatcoins">Fiatcoins</h4>
<p>Unlike Libra, JPM Coin is USD on a DLT, and will be regulated as a bank deposit, attract FIDC insurance, and behave like normal USD. Although it will be on a DLT, it will be permissioned and the other banks who have signed up to use it will access it through APIs to J.P. Morgan itself who will run all the nodes itself. In essence the ‘distributed’ part of DLT will be absent.</p>
<p>Although the vision for JPM Coin includes corporate use, initially it will be a bank-to-bank product only. Corporates will not be able to use JPM Coin directly, but through their own bank accounts as a replacement of correspondent banking for cross border transfers.</p>
<p>With SWIFT GPI becoming mandatory for 10,000 banks in 2020, it may seem hard to understand the unique selling point of JPM Coin. Cost is suggested as a driver. If it heralds cross border payments for pennies, then it certainly deserves treasurers’ support.</p>
<p>In order to maintain speed, JPM Coin DLT will handle only minimal data payload with payments. Enriched data, such as remittance information to aid in reconciliation, will go through a separate network, although this opens up risks of data synchronisation.</p>
<p>Unlike Libra, which might potentially replace USD as the global currency, if successful, JPM Coin might rather entrench on the USD hegemony. Under the correspondent banking model, it might also undermine today’s USD clearers, and could bring a huge deposit base to J.P. Morgan itself.</p>
<p>JPM Coin is credible new technology, coming from a major global bank. It is simply USD regulated by the Federal Reserve and the US bank regulatory system. Unlike Libra, which raises questions to regulators and users alike, JPM Coin will have minimal barriers to adoption. Its success depends only on market acceptance, which will be largely down to commercial factors – mainly cost.</p>
<h4 id="digital-fiat-currency">Digital fiat currency</h4>
<p>Digital fiat currency could be surprisingly disruptive too, as it effectively offers the public direct access to central bank money. In the current system (fractional reserve banking), the public has access to money mediated and created by commercial banks. The central bank provides banking to the commercial banks, and manages money through policy rates and the commercial banks through regulation.</p>
<p>This means that digital fiat currency, depending on how it is introduced, might disintermediate the commercial banks, since the public would be able to bank directly with the central bank. This is not so outlandish – in the 2018 Vollgeld referendum, Switzerland voted against a proposal to restrict money creation to the central bank, for example to stop fractional reserve banking.</p>
<p>In this sense, JPM Coin is a far more conservative suggestion than digital fiat currency because it maintains the role of banks in fractional reserve banking. However, it risks fragmenting the market – even if bank coins are all in a regulated peg to USD. This raises the question – how will users choose between J.P. Morgan-, Citi, Bank of America Merrill Lynch-, and Wells Fargo- coins? Will they all be interoperable?</p>
<p>If JPM Coin is really useful, it would be better if organised as a multi-bank service like current clearing systems such as CHIPS, ACH, and THC for real-time payments. The Federal Reserve wants to implement another fast payment system to compete with THC – potentially a digital fiat currency on blockchain could fulfil this function.</p>
<p>Digital fiat currency need not be on a DLT. The Dutch central bank tested DNBcoin on a DLT in 2015. The Swedish National bank (Riksbank) has been studying e-krona since 2017 in a technology agnostic way – either allowing the public to open accounts directly with the Riksbank or implementing e-krona as a token presumably on DLT (or even both).</p>
<p>Stefan Ingves, governor of the Riksbank believes that the two solutions are not very different from an economic perspective:</p>
<p>“If we construct an e-krona, there are in principle two models we could base it on,” he says. “In one of them, the e-kronas would be held in an account with the Riksbank and in the other, the e-kronas would be in the form of digital units of value (tokens) stored locally, for instance on a card or in a mobile app.”</p>
<p>So far, the Riksbank seems to be proceeding towards implementing e-krona at some point in the future.</p>
<p>Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, recently hinted that the global economy needs a new hegemonic currency to replace the USD. “It is an open question whether such a new SHC would be best provided by the public sector, perhaps through a network of central bank digital currencies.”</p>
<p>This sounds much more like Libra than JPM Coin.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>It remains hard to predict the near future of Stablecoins, but in the longer term it is likely that central banks will start to offer digital fiat currencies in various forms. This will be a functional boon for treasurers and may also disrupt fractional reserve banking – which will be a big change. JPM Coin faces no impediment, other than pricing. Libra will continue to face regulatory and political resistance, which is disappointing because the risks can be managed through regulation and it would be a great opportunity to let Facebook bear the cost.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4>How much growth are you currently seeing in the commercial cards market?</h4>
<p>The market is growing at a compound annual growth rate of about 7%. A lot of this growth is from digitisation and simplified users’ experiences, plus the constant growth in businesses accepting card payments – underpinning commercial cards is 60 years of experience, real-time data flow, 24/7 reliability and a global network.</p>
<p>In terms of where the growth is focused, virtual cards are our fastest growing product for customers. Virtual cards use the same network as the ones in your pocket, but they are effectively a tokenised number that looks and feels like a credit card and can be used in exactly the same way – but with a series of additional controls that can be set around it. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A card that is going be used for a new product launch event can be locked down so it can only be used for certain types of transactions, such as lighting, engineering and exhibition space. It could also have a fixed budget for the event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can interface with other systems and a business using a virtual card solution can generate card details over API link. A great example of using this is with an e-procurement catalogue loaded with goods and services offered by our clients’ own suppliers. Our client may have their own internal approval processes and, at the point of payment, the e-procurement tool connects with HSBC via API, checks for approval and generates tokenised card details with set parameters; populating the details within the portal to process the payment – all fully automated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Another driver is business-to-business (B2B) procurement. We’re increasingly seeing cards being used by businesses to pay suppliers – and there are a number of benefits to both parties in doing that, including cash flow improvements, increased security and controls and access to rich transaction data, including what has been purchased, from which type of supplier, when, and by whom.</p>
<p>And a third driver is mobile wallets, whereby you can have cards loaded onto your mobile wallet and pick the right card for your purchase. We’re investing in our mobile app which will allow things like taking a photo of an expense receipt, coding it on the fly and automating steps in the expense process.</p>
<h4>Is growth mostly coming from people who haven’t had a card scheme before, or from customers with existing schemes who are looking to take advantage of these new opportunities?</h4>
<p>It’s a good mix of both. The UK is the biggest commercial cards market in Europe, but we’re currently issuing cards across continental Europe in nine currencies. Some of these markets have historically been less cards-focused, but this is rapidly changing.</p>
<p>Most of our customers stay with us a long time. Some growth happens organically as the programme gets further embraced within the organisation, but one of the keys to the success of a card programme is the ongoing consultation we provide.</p>
<h4>Why do your clients typically use commercial cards?</h4>
<p>If a customer doesn’t have a commercial cards programme today, the only real choice for an individual who is travelling on business is to use their own card – which provides zero information to the company and little control over what they buy at the time of purchase, where they stayed and who they flew with. And of course, it’s a cash-based expense which is open to some risk and significant inefficiency driven by the complexity of expense management and reconciliation when using this approach for a large community of travelling employees.</p>
<p>With a cards programme, treasury can see exactly how much expense is coming out at any time, planned in advance because it is centralised on a cards programme. On the procurement side, you can complete the purchase on order or on invoice, yet the business pays later – and if you buy something that doesn’t materialise into a delivery of goods or services, you are protected from that and get an immediate credit – just like when you use a personal credit card.</p>
<p>Historically HSBC has focused on corporates, but we are increasingly doing more business in the public sector space, which often has edicts to pay suppliers within a set period of time. In Europe, for example, there are initiatives to pay small businesses in days rather than weeks or months. That’s a tough ask if you’re receiving a paper invoice that needs to be sent to the right people, get the appropriate coding and be approved before it is put on a payment run system and settled. Compare that to paying by card at the point of transaction – the supplier knows it is paid immediately, gets the cash in their account within a day or two and our customer can still benefit from up to 56 days before funds are debited from their account.</p>
<p>Other uses include lodge cards or central travel accounts. If you book your travel through the registered travel agent, your flight will be centrally billed to your own cost centre and matched with the invoice details including: who travelled, who approved the travel, when it was booked and what class of travel it was, before being posted straight to the general ledger.</p>
<p>And to give a further example, our fuel cards can be used to log each trip as business mileage or personal mileage, with HMRC approved VAT reporting included. Many new vehicles now capture data analytics – so we’ve done some work integrating with a fintech which can collect data directly from connected vehicles and automatically validate associate details of a trip when it has been made.</p>
<h4>How does the use of commercial cards benefit suppliers?</h4>
<p>Early or guaranteed payment is a major benefit. I think it wouldn’t be remiss to say that some large organisations can take a while to pay, because getting the invoice and approvals from the right people at the right time can be difficult. That causes a real headache for small businesses in terms of the cost of chasing up payments and effectively being out of pocket for a period of time.</p>
<p>A great example would be media companies and marketing agencies where people have outlays for advertising and copywriters, and then bill their client for the work. If the organisation takes a long time to pay because of their own inefficiencies, this can have a material impact on a smaller business. So, accepting card payments upfront and getting that money the next business day is extremely attractive.</p>
<p>There are also costs and risks involved in handling cash – you have to reconcile it, count it, package it up and bank it. If everything is done by card, these issues are avoided. Also suppliers can benefit from information about their customers, as well as giving them a very automated way of doing their own accounting.</p>
<p>At the same time, accepting card payments can make it very easy for a buyer to do business with a particular supplier, compared to having to send purchase orders and requisitions back and forth. Once this is understood by both buyer and supplier, they typically promote card payments and see them as a robust alternative to more traditional payment methods.</p>
<h4>How can different stakeholders within the business, such as treasury, finance, and HR, leverage the benefits of a card programme?</h4>
<p>What treasurers are really looking for is predictability in their cycle. The product or service they are selling may be seasonal, but when expenses are haphazard, that can cause a cash flow squeeze. So, knowing 30 or 60 days in advance what is coming out – because it’s all carded – is very attractive to a treasurer. With the ability to have a single card programme in many local currencies a business can also reduce the exposure to foreign exchange fees.</p>
<p>From a finance, CFO and accounts payable perspective, card programmes can bring a lot of process efficiency, and in turn cost savings, as well as increasing visibility and control by turning everything digital. We have a front-end card management tool called MiVision which captures all this data, allows reporting, and provides a real-time view of card expenditure. If you can compare how much you are spending with different London hotels, this can help with negotiation – which then comes into play with procurement.</p>
<p>Then there’s HR. By restricting a programme to suppliers that are within the policy of that company, it means that card can’t be used with certain providers, which can minimise potential risk in the organisation. There’s also an element of safeguarding here. With a card you know where it’s being used, which to some degree lets you know where your employees are – so that in itself is helpful.</p>
<p>With so many stakeholders, it’s important to get everyone around the table. When we receive an RFP that is led by one function in isolation – perhaps a procurement exercise – that typically doesn’t lend itself to the benefits everyone can get from a programme. So I think stakeholder engagement is absolutely critical at the very earliest part of the process.</p>
<h4>What factors are typically driving the adoption of card payments?</h4>
<p>On the fintech side, we work with companies that provide data analytics and a digital customer experience as part of our MiVision tool; all of which drive adoption and helps with speed of integration. Having a large bank integrating with a large corporate hasn’t always been the fastest of processes, so having these players in the middle is something that we warmly embrace.</p>
<p>Having real-time access to information and controls can also give the CFO more confidence. In the past, there may have been a perception that giving card programmes with large limits to employees could introduce possible risk of misuse – but in reality, it means showing that you can see everything that is happening at any given time. So I think our front-end reporting and card management tool is really helping with that.</p>
<p>Another thing we are working on is taking the friction out of card acceptance. Once the supplier and buyer have agreed that they are going to use a card programme for a particular settlement type, we can then use a third party to integrate with the supplier. So, upon authorisation from our system the supplier just gets the money in their account. That’s something we are very excited about.</p>
<h4>Are there any other barriers to adoption that companies may need to overcome?</h4>
<p>Card acceptance is one. Some companies may think their suppliers don’t accept cards. What we can do is analyse their accounts payable file to show which of their suppliers is card-accepting.</p>
<p>Supplier acceptance of cards is constantly growing – for example, some coffee shops and bars are now completely cashless, so the only way to use them is by paying with a card. But when cards aren’t accepted we can help with that as well. One of the things HSBC provides is a supplier onboarding programme, whereby we work with a partner who does an outreach programme with suppliers to get them signed up to accept card payments.</p>
<p>Likewise, we are integrated with Amazon Business and can take a client’s invoice data, broken down by line item, and share that through MiVision. Often clients will tell us they don’t buy anything from Amazon – but if we carry out an analysis with Amazon, we usually find that employees are actually using Amazon a lot, because it’s an efficient and easy service for them to use. So there’s an opportunity for clients to put in controls around that and collect the data they need.</p>
<p>There’s an older view that if employees are putting in a cash expense it can limit them, whereas giving them a card means they could potentially spend on something you don’t want them to. But we can clearly show that a card programme can be used to apply limits and adjust up or down as needed. For example, if employees are stuck in a particular location due to an airline strike or hurricane, you can help them by increasing their card limit in real-time through our web or mobile service.</p>
<p>Another consideration is that large companies may be looking for centralised programmes, covering multiple countries and currencies in a consistent way. With HSBC now issuing in 43 countries our clients can have the same experience; data and reporting all centralised in one place for their employees and subsidiaries around the world.</p>
<h4>How else does HSBC support clients in making the best use of commercial cards?</h4>
<p>We have card account managers who are experts in our clients’ businesses. Their job is to work with clients who have large cards programmes and improve or grow those programmes. We provide an industry expert who works with those clients, with an individual point of contact who understands that client’s business, runs initiatives and campaigns and shares best practice.</p>
<p>For example, a company might have a mandated cards programme, but find that there are still a lot of cash expenses coming through – our experts can help to analyse that data and identify the best approach to achieve greater policy compliance.</p>
<h4>How do you see this market developing over the coming years?</h4>
<p>I think we will continue to see a convergence of payment types. Today you have card payments that are made to card accepting suppliers. Then there are traditional payments, such as BACS and Faster Payments.</p>
<p>I think with the continuing development of fintech, and the ability to bring AI into the mix, it will be increasingly possible to look at the customer’s cash position and make recommendations on payment types. For example, if the company is a bit low on cash and is coming to a reporting period, they could choose to make more payments via the cards programme. I think we will see that kind of intelligent use of cards programmes, even as the physical card increasingly disappears from the mix, with customers using cards to influence their own cash positions.</p>
<p>Finally, we focus a lot on user experience in the cards world, and this will continue to drive development. The easier we make life for the CFO, procurement, HR and the end user, the more they will embrace and use the product.</p></div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>Companies are urged to innovate or die, to be agile and exploratory… and at the same time to deliver consistent cash flow. Managing this dialectic is tricky to say the least.</em></p>
<h4 id="descobrimentos">Descobrimentos</h4>
<p>Contrary to many Anglo-Saxon myths, it was the Portuguese who “discovered” most of the world. There is evidence the Portuguese may have sailed the Pacific coast of South America well before Columbus’ crossing in 1492. It also seems likely that the Portuguese sailed to Australia more than two centuries before James Cook.</p>
<p>Portuguese maritime innovation and exploration may have been enough to assure their independence in the face of much larger and aggressive neighbours like Spain and France. Eventually, however, they somehow lost the first mover advantage over the centuries.</p>
<p>Portugal epitomises the need to explore and some of the risks thereof.</p>
<h4 id="innovators-dilemma">Innovator’s dilemma</h4>
<p>Companies trying to innovate face many challenges. One problem is that shareholders value stability. But innovation and exploration are inherently destabilising, and since businesses have a duty to shareholders, this may slow them down. On the other hand, if businesses do not innovate, they risk getting left behind by others who are bolder.</p>
<p>Ferdinand Magellan made it round the world but countless, nameless sailors died at sea beforehand. Similarly, we tend to have a success bias when looking at innovation because we only hear about the successes. We don’t consider the huge numbers of innovations that fail to take hold in the marketplace.</p>
<p>From incumbents’ position, this is exacerbated in current market conditions by cheap funding and low yield expectations afforded by investors to start-ups that are perceived to be innovative.</p>
<p>From the perspective of an established bank, innovative new virtual banks are frightening less because of their agility than for their ability to attract new funding without making any profits.</p>
<p>Incumbents are not given this licence to innovate by investors – they are expected to maintain profit growth.</p>
<h4 id="stagnation-risk">Stagnation risk</h4>
<p>On the other hand, if you are not advancing you are falling behind. Kodak famously developed digital cameras well ahead of the market but did not know what to do with the technology; others tried stuff out, and by the time digital cameras were established, it was too late for Kodak to enter the market that wiped them out.</p>
<p>Execution also plays a role. Xerox PARC developed much of the basis of modern computing then let others profit from the new concepts. Commercial history is littered with innovators who were out-competed by copy cats.</p>
<h4 id="benefits-of-heft">Benefits of heft</h4>
<p>A key aspect of innovation is having the resources to fail until you succeed. Start-ups get this from their patient investors. Others can get it from their own cash flow. Google for example seems to spend large amounts of money on big innovation and they can afford failures.</p>
<p>A current and topical case for treasurers is Facebook’s Libra. After initial excitement about the world changing implications of bitcoin, people realised that even if the blockchain is secure, its periphery may not be – guzzling more electricity than Ireland for anonymous payments is hardly very green; and ten minutes per transfer is not fast.</p>
<p>Plenty of start-ups with more or less funding have tried to come up with better versions, while scamsters flooded the world with initial coin offerings and other innovative ways to fleece people.</p>
<p>In the calm following the storm, large banks have started to get interested on their own terms. J.P. Morgan, for instance, will launch a stable coin called JPM Coin which they call “a digital coin representing a fiat currency”.</p>
<h4 id="facebook-libra">Facebook Libra</h4>
<p>Facebook launched Libra as a blockchain-based stable coin underpinned by fiat reserves, proclaiming its mission “is to enable a simple global currency and financial infrastructure that empowers billions of people”.</p>
<p>Facebook, which like J.P. Morgan also has plenty of cash to innovate with, is bringing a different kind of heft to this space. Three billion users dwarf any bank’s access. This brings a degree of plausibility to Libra – merchants and service providers are much more likely to accept a stable coin with an accessible market of three billion people.</p>
<p>JPM Coin is targeted at corporate payments with goals like making payment netting unnecessary. Facebook Libra targets the global financial ecosystem and wants to bring in the 1.7 billion unbanked along the way. The increment in Libra is its ambition level.</p>
<p>I recently heard a fintech claim that “payments is a problem rooted in code”. Presumably Facebook has the coding nous to make Libra work. But I think payments is a problem rooted in trust, and trust engenders regulation. Assuming the technology works and the ecosystem is effective, Facebook still has to win regulatory approval and popular trust.</p>
<h4 id="financial-innovation">Financial innovation</h4>
<p>Unlike market innovations like securitisation and high frequency trading which benefit only the financial markets themselves, innovations in the payment space like Libra, may be beneficial for society and for the real economy. Libra (or something like it) could be as real an innovation as the ATM.</p>
<p>Some banks and some software providers seem to be working towards this kind of innovation in aid of the real economy. DBS in Singapore thankfully changed its motto from “making banking joyful” to the much more useful “making banking invisible”. Banks and ERPs are increasingly working together to make payments and collections – and eventually invoicing and reconciliation – invisible to the business. Call it “finance as a service”.</p>
<p>To achieve finance as a service will require heft and also a different mindset. Peter Drucker emphasised the distinction between efficiency and effectiveness: “Efficiency is doing things right; effectiveness is doing the right things.” Maybe incumbent banks are too focused on efficiency (“joyful”) and not enough on effectiveness (“invisible”).</p>
<p>New players without attachment to current banking practices can take a more holistic view of commerce and look at making finance invisible – ie everything after purchase order and acceptance of delivery is invisible. This kind of STP for commerce can be achieved for example with smart contracts.</p>
<h4 id="agile">Agile</h4>
<p>Management consultants are having a field day promoting agile as their new mantra. I am a huge fan of agile, and it is certainly a much more fun way to work. But incumbents struggle with its apparent unpredictability.</p>
<p>Delivery risk management is traditionally based on having clarity about the destination, and a detailed map of how to get there. The Portuguese knew the overland route to Asia – it was long and expensive, and full of unpredictable “taxes” along the way. Sounds like 20<sup>th</sup> century payments!</p>
<p>The exploratory mindset requires a different kind of risk management – less long-range planning and more quick responses to short-term threats. It is also a mindset that accepts losses.</p>
<p>Doing agile right requires an exploratory mindset – both in the sense of wondering what might be out there and in the sense of managing risks in the face of uncertainty. The sense of wonder and curiosity is hard to nurture when you have hundreds of years of experience that reinforce the status quo.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>Treasurers are generally risk averse and change resistant, and for good reason. A treasurer’s mandate is normally to minimise financial risk so that maximum capital can be allocated to the core business. The world is changing, and treasurers who still do things on paper risk being catastrophically ineffective, not to mention inefficient, within a decade.</p>
<p>Adopting an exploratory mindset feels almost counter cultural to the profession’s risk aversion. Even after overcoming built in conservatism, exploration carries real risks. These risks have to be owned and accepted by and for the company as a whole.</p>
<p>Competition will likely force incumbents to become more efficient, but new entrants will be looking for effectiveness and potentially changing the ground rules. Treasurers may have to look outside their well-established bank relationships for their future path.</p>
<p>Exploration is no guarantee of success. But stagnation does guarantee irrelevance.</p></div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>STP in treasury is often looked at in an atomistic way, for instance, avoiding rekeying payments into e-banking systems and rekeying foreign exchange deals into treasury management systems. To get maximum efficiency, STP has to be viewed in a holistic way.</em></p>
<p>With the digital era over half a century old it is surprising how many treasuries still interface with operating companies and even banks with email and Excel spreadsheets. But the fact that email and Excel enable enterprise-wide data to be collected and processed ipso facto proves that all the needed data is available in some system or other.</p>
<p>The real problem is normally that the data is in disparate systems. Some may be too old to have modern APIs yet they are capable of outputting something that ends up in Excel. And whatever Excel can read (or have pasted into it), other systems can read.</p>
<p>The key point is that the data is out there, and normally in some kind of structure that makes it machine readable. Machine readable data is better handled by data processing, ie software, than by humans. This is especially true of finance data that treasury normally consumes.</p>
<h4 id="erp">ERP</h4>
<p>In the dreams of ERP vendors, all this should be moot. After all, ERP means enterprise resource planning, and the idea is that everything is integrated in the ERP. Also, the ‘planning’ part of ERP implies business plans, including financial plans – meaning treasury can simply read the cash flow forecast from the ERP.</p>
<p>That’s the theory. In practice many enterprises use their ERP as a glorified general ledger. So before diving into APIs and robotic process automation (RPA) and other work arounds, it makes sense to investigate why ERP is not being used in an integrated manner. Often it is because implementing basic accounting functionality was such a costly nightmare that no one wants to try other functionality. Or else IT is overwhelmed with the two-yearly version upgrade cycle – anyone for SaaS?</p>
<p>Treasury will probably not drive full implementation of ERP across the enterprise but it may be worth it investigating whether the ERP might provide a decent solution for cash flow forecasting.</p>
<h4 id="connecting-systems">Connecting systems</h4>
<p>When, for whatever reasons, there is not one integrated ERP covering treasury’s information needs, some way of connecting systems is required. The bad old way of connecting systems is to manually rekey data from one system into the other.</p>
<p>Arguably more dangerous is to copy-paste from the source system into Excel, mess up the data in Excel with formula errors and more copy-pasting, and then copy-paste the resulting stew into the target system. Compared to the bad old way described previously, this simply allows humans to mess things up at scale.</p>
<p>File transfer is much more reliable and still a very valid way to connect systems. Typically, the source system exports a file to a directory, which the target system is checking regularly, and when the target system detects the file it imports it. This has been used for decades and is reliable and convenient.</p>
<p>A lot of corporate to bank communication is done in this way using SWIFT standards. The bottom line is if the data can be put into Excel (other than by rekeying) then it can be transferred to the target system – thus avoiding all the risks involved in manual handling, not to mention all the brain atrophy that involves.</p>
<p>File transfer typically handles bulk transactions. It is possible to export an individual transaction but most file transfers comprise many transactions. Status messaging and error handling in the file transfer space is typically by return file. In other words, the source system exports transactions, the target system imports transactions and exports the status of import in another file which is in turn read by the source system. Although this may sound a bit lugubrious, in practice it normally happens within seconds.</p>
<h4 id="api">API</h4>
<p>APIs are designed for atomic transactions – an API sends and reports status on each individual transaction. This is conducive to near real-time processing between systems.</p>
<p>Although APIs are much in the news following PSD2 and other API and open banking initiatives, they are as old as computers. For example, “apps” use API calls for operating system services such as reading the keyboard and saving files. The browser is using API calls to display this text on the screen now.</p>
<p>APIs are used within ERPs to enable different modules to communicate. And they are extensively used on the web, for instance in ‘mash-ups’.</p>
<p>Using APIs between different systems requires that both source and target systems use compatible APIs. To a limited extent, middleware can translate between different API standards. Older systems that do not support APIs cannot easily be connected via API.</p>
<p>To illustrate, consider SWIFT. FileAct is a file transfer method of corporate to bank communication. FIN is an API method of corporate to bank communication – individual MT101 messages are checked and acknowledged by the SWIFT network before being sent on to banks.</p>
<p>APIs – where available – are generally the best way to connect systems, and are likely to be the most future proof.</p>
<h4 id="rpa">RPA</h4>
<p>RPA is an important evolving technology for those situations where APIs and file transfers are not feasible – typically because of old systems and/or lack of budget.</p>
<p>RPA is at its core a way to automate manual operations on computer systems, based on screen scraping. An RPA can broadly repeat any sequence that a human would do. For example, click the “Add” button, key in transaction data, then click the “Save” button.</p>
<p>Anyone who has faced inscrutable error messages and other computer glitches will guess that the above quickly gets more complicated in the real world. So, RPA vendors build in various degrees of flexibility and even intelligence to keep the robots running smoothly.</p>
<p>Advanced RPAs can be programmed to make simple decisions that humans would otherwise make, and are being rolled out for insurance and mortgage application processing, for example.</p>
<p>In the context of connecting systems, a typical use case for RPA would be to scrape transaction data from the screen(s) of source system and key that data into the target system. In practice, commercial RPA software can also process the data that it handles, for instance to validate or translate data.</p>
<h4 id="example-use-case">Example use case</h4>
<p>Foreign exchange (FX) hedging is a process which is often not handled in a holistic manner. A typical legacy process might run over a dozen steps beginning with the subsidiary manually collecting data from sales and procurement systems, building an Excel of expected FX cash flows for their entity and emailing that to treasury, which then has to progress it further through many more steps like copy-pasting to consolidated Excel; manually entering new net forwards to be executed into eFX platform; checking confirmation emails and approving payments before finally being able to manually reconcile bank accounts.</p>
<p>This is all fraught with risk of errors and probably requires multiple reconciliations and manual checks to ensure reasonable accuracy. It can be much improved from operational risk and cost perspectives.</p>
<p>The reformed process begins with sales and procurement data being exported to the TMS directly and synchronised with forecasts therein. The TMS uploads new net forwards to the eFX platform; treasury manually prices new net forwards to be executed on the eFX platform; the eFX platform uploads executed forwards to TMS; confirmations are handled by either with only exceptions needing human intervention; TMS exports required payments to banks and auto-reconciles bank accounts, again with only unreconciled items needing human intervention.</p>
<p>This is much safer and cheaper, and also frees employees for more value-added activity. It can be implemented even in the most heterogenous system environments, even sclerotic legacy systems.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>Current technologies enable treasurers to stitch together disparate systems to build effective processes that reduce risk and save time and money while making employees happier. It is no longer necessary to wait for new silver bullet solutions – alloys are more durable.</p></div>

<h5> </h5>
<h5>What challenges are CFOs, treasurers and other finance professionals facing in the coming year?</h5>
<p>I would note three challenges that CFOs are currently facing. The first is digitisation. CFOs are re-evaluating existing structures, processes and tools and are exploring how digital solutions can be leveraged to make their processes better and more secure. They are also working to achieve more transparency over what is happening within their organisations.</p>
<p>The second topic, which goes a little further, is about process automation. Finance leaders are looking to make processes as automated as possible, while removing manual tasks and the need for manual intervention. Rather than simply fixing specific issues, CFOs are proactively addressing topics such as fraud and increasing transparency over cash flow.</p>
<p>The third challenge, particularly for CFOs that are working for growing companies, is to determine how they can enable their organisations as they expand, and what technology they can put in place to support their growth.</p>
<h5>To what extent can the technology used in treasury and finance overcome these challenges while supporting company growth?</h5>
<p>Technology is on a lot of people’s radar. But the majority of companies are relying on a large variety and volume of legacy systems – so even though they may be aware of the challenge and the need to introduce new technology, only a few have been able to take effective action.</p>
<p>What levers can they pull to achieve this? Investing in technology can bring considerable opportunities. This might mean looking at whether there are any sub-processes that are still handled manually, such as cash application, and considering the alternatives. There are scalable options out there, particularly cloud solutions that can support inorganic growth by quickly integrating new companies. The challenge is how best to combine the old on-premise technology world with the new cloud world. Hybrid cloud solutions that have a deep connection with the core ERP system, while still offering full flexibility of scale, will be a major lever going forward.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Cloud brings huge benefits. It addresses not only scalability, but also ERP independence: rather than bringing everybody onto the same ERP, companies can interconnect multiple ERPs via API.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In many cases, I’ve seen CFOs adjust their mind-set as they begin looking more closely into the opportunities brought by a more integrated process. Instead of considering a variety of different vendors and solutions, which may be both specialised and siloed, CFOs are increasingly looking at the big picture and how to get more out of technology with an integrated approach. Take, for example, the order to cash (O2C) cycle. If you just automate and optimise, say, the credit management part of the O2C cycle, you can certainly make that part more efficient, but you still face the risk of losing efficiency in the following process steps such as cash application or collection management – so by optimising all the steps of that cycle, you can actually achieve world-class processes. That’s where a one-stop shop (like Serrala) can help CFOs implement the solutions they need to overcome these challenges.</p>
<h5>So how do you feel treasury functions can harvest developments in technology in order to grow?</h5>
<p>It is advisable to carry out a thorough analysis of the status quo and evaluate things that have ‘always been done like that’. Certain parts of processes may still be done via Excel or manual interference, and this can impede the company’s ability to scale up and efficiently avoid fraud. Whenever there is manual interaction, or an Excel-based process, the CFO loses control over what is really happening. From a technology point of view, there have been a lot of developments in recent years, and scalable tools that can help companies operate more effectively.</p>
<h5>In terms of the technologies that have been developed over the last few years, which do you see as having the most potential for the treasury community?</h5>
<p>Cloud brings huge benefits. It addresses not only scalability, but also ERP independence: rather than bringing everybody onto the same ERP, companies can interconnect multiple ERPs via API. They can even have the comfort of choosing whether to work from the ERP or a cloud solution, so they can rapidly improve processes without significant retraining, which is why the opportunities brought by hybrid solutions are so compelling.</p>
<p>The other technology development that is making inroads in treasury is what I would call intelligent automation. There is a lot of discussion around robotic process automation (RPA), but using robots to do the same tasks doesn’t bring true flexibility, because once you change something on the underlying layer you have to retrain the robot. Intelligent automation goes beyond that: it means that you identify ways for continuously enhancing processes to achieve end-to-end automation. With intelligent automation you can go beyond RPA and take away the need for a robot that imitates a single manual task, because you have automated the entire process itself.</p>
<p>Take outbound payments, for example: your invoices can be automatically posted within seconds of capture based on auto-posting criteria. If an invoice doesn’t meet these criteria, it will be automatically routed for exception handling to the appropriate user. Intelligent automation saves you a lot of time and makes the processes more secure, accurate and transparent at the same time.</p>
<p>Where we see even more use cases is in machine learning – in other words, the machine can learn how to improve processes over time, using historical data to become better at predicting the future. It’s important to be careful about where this really applies. For example, there is a good use case in cash management, where you can leverage historical data to get a more solid forecast on your cash and liquidity. But there are other areas where it is more difficult to apply this, such as in fraud detection.</p>
<p>Ideally a company won’t have enough historical fraud cases to be able to learn based on those events, so the approach here needs to be slightly different. Rather, you can leverage the cloud and APIs in order to access additional data points and derive fraud-detection rules based on a far higher portfolio of information, potentially even from a larger set of companies. It’s always better for companies to leverage the knowledge and experience of a technology vendor, rather than trying to reinvent the wheel in-house. Only a technology company has enough data points to come up with the intelligent logic needed to monitor this and enable proactive fraud prevention.</p>
<h5>Given the rise of instant payments, how can treasurers avoid exposing their companies to the associated risks?</h5>
<p>The reality is that manual management is simply not possible when it comes to instant payments and higher processing speeds. Companies have to be able to proactively analyse big data volumes and detect payments that seem to have a risk of fraud. A real-time solution is therefore needed to track and trace any fraud attempts instantly. Possible solutions include blockchain, as well as the use of payment management technology that identifies certain patterns.</p>
<p>Each company must also understand to what extent instant payments create additional value for them or for their customers. There are some very clear use cases: retailers, for example, can gain immediate certainty that a customer’s payment has cleared, potentially meaning that orders can be fulfilled sooner. In other areas, the benefits of instant payments may be less clear cut.</p>
<h5>When it comes to adopting new technologies, are there any particular barriers from the point of view of clients?</h5>
<p>I think, generally, people are rather hesitant when it comes to change. As we all know, implementing new technology involves the business – but it also involves IT. So there are multiple stakeholders, and managing all these stakeholders can be a challenge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We are looking into all the different technology fields that are out there, including cloud, machine learning, artificial intelligence and blockchain.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another consideration is that when new technology is introduced, training may be needed to bring everybody onto the same page and tell the story of why this change is positive. Keeping the organisation up to date with technology can take a lot of effort and may require internal resources. Again, a hybrid cloud solution can provide a balance by enabling change without changing everything.</p>
<h5>In a hybrid cloud situation, if companies reach a point where the new technology is overwhelmingly positive and beneficial, can they then get rid of their legacy technology?</h5>
<p>Exactly. Typically new innovation would be focused in the cloud part of the hybrid cloud model. The more functionality there is in the cloud part of the hybrid cloud model, the more people will get used to it – and the more you will have a natural movement towards really leveraging cloud tools.</p>
<h5>And how would you respond to those that really do persist in hanging onto legacy technology?</h5>
<p>At Serrala, we only pursue innovation which creates real benefits for our users, whether that means managing risk more effectively or reducing process costs. These benefits can be considerable: by managing processes in a standardised way, companies can ensure there is no opportunity for an employee to take money out of the business, for example. The longer you wait to implement changes, the more difficult it will be to achieve best practice in these critical areas.</p>
<h5>How does Serrala’s offering tap into the latest technologies and how are you pushing the envelope in terms of what’s available now?</h5>
<p>We are looking into all the different technology fields that are out there, including cloud, machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain.</p>
<p>On the topic of cloud, we have recently launched our new solution group called Alevate, which is a whole set of cloud solutions which effectively form a B2B portal. With this cloud portal, our customers can manage their inbound and outbound payment processes through one central cloud solution. We also have a hybrid cloud model which connects the SAP world with the cloud, providing full transparency over the transactions that are happening in both worlds.</p>
<p>When it comes to machine learning, our solutions in areas such as inbound payments have historically been rule-based. We have been analysing whether we could replace the rule-based approach with AI for the matching of incoming payments. However, if you adopt a purely machine learning/AI-based approach, you may not understand why matching has taken place. And if you do not achieve 100% accuracy, you will have trouble explaining that to your auditor. We are therefore exploring how to achieve best results by combining a rule-based approach with rules derived from machine learning. In this model, the machine looks at historical matching data and comes up with a new rule, which is then approved by the user.</p>
<p>Regarding blockchain, there was quite some hype in the last months and now people have realised that a lot of investment is needed. It is therefore important to make sure that any solution developed using blockchain technology creates real business value. For us, our portal presents a natural use case, in that you can execute supply chain finance transactions that are derived from a vendor B2B portal and then execute these payments by leveraging blockchain technology. This can provide faster processing speed and lower transaction costs. We see real applicability for corporates that may be able to carry out supply chain finance or dynamic discounting by leveraging blockchain.</p>
<p>A second use case is that you can leverage blockchain over time to create a super secure audit trail of all the different transactions taking place. We are working on evaluating this more deeply, but it will take time for large organisations to adapt and implement these types of solutions on a large scale.</p>
<p>These are our expectations. Our mission statement says that we want to empower and protect our customers in order to avoid any risks that are out there, whether that’s the risk of fraud or the risk of insufficient liquidity. So, companies that embrace process automation will be better prepared to be above-benchmark, reduce their operational costs, and have positive customer relations on both sides of the payments process, such as when sending out invoices or collecting money.</p>
<p>Indeed, our own research into the future of finance asked about finance leaders’ priorities for the coming five years, and 98% of respondents referenced the importance of increasing automation. On the other hand, only 9% said their processes are already fully automated. So it seems clear that while finance professionals have identified this as an important topic, there is still mileage to be gained by organisations.</p></div>

<p><span><strong>Matthew Davies, Head of Global Transaction Services EMEA:</strong></span> Matthew heads up the global transaction services business for BofAML for Europe, Middle East and Africa. We spend a huge amount of time with our US client base, but we also have significant international relationships with our European, Asian and Latin American headquartered clients. Some of those perspectives differ, so I want to try and share some of those today.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span><strong>Stephanie Wolf, Global Head of Financial Institutions &amp; Public Sector Banking for Global Transaction Services:</strong></span> I run our global financial services franchise from a client-coverage perspective. That includes traditional financial institutions, our correspondent bank clients and non-bank financial institutions, as well as global government entities, around the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n3">
<p><span><strong>Hubert J.P. Jolly, Global Head of Financing and Channels, Global Transaction Services:</strong></span> J.P. has responsibility for financing and channels, which includes BofAML’s trade and supply chain business, cards and payables. This is a comprehensive solution set, so pre-paid and commercial cards, digital channels, online mobile direct connectivity and innovation all fall within my domain.</p>
</div>
<h4>What is going on in corporate treasury today? Are the fundamentals changing and what are the key trends you are seeing?</h4>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span><strong>Matthew Davies:</strong></span> There has been quite a shift since the global financial crisis. Up until that point, the focus was very much on traditional areas of treasury. That focus continues today but what has changed is that the role of the treasurer has become so much broader. Treasurers have had to develop new skillsets to spread the reach of treasury much further across the company.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n3">
<p><span><strong>J.P. Jolly:</strong></span> Corporates are also looking to drive operating efficiency from technology, which includes digitising the treasury function. Digitisation is driving treasurers to review their supply chains, and how they can help their partners in procurement and manufacturing be more efficient. This includes how they should pay their suppliers and how they can get capital to suppliers who may require it. Last but not least, they are exploring how they can help their companies collect payments more efficiently.</p>
</div>
<h4>Resources in corporate treasury are always limited. So how do you see corporates coping with the need to digitise?</h4>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span><strong>Matthew Davies:</strong></span> Introducing automation through the use of robotics can enable treasury to become much more efficient. This offers a great opportunity for corporate treasuries to gain that efficiency so they can use the resources that they have much more effectively on strategic initiatives.</p>

<div class="person n3">
<p><span><strong>J.P. Jolly:</strong></span> I think there is an opportunity to free up working capital, particularly given rising interest rates in the US and other markets. We are seeing some corporates deploying supply chain finance when they haven’t done so before.</p>
<p>We are also combining supply chain finance with virtual purchasing cards in order to provide clients with a seamless solution. For example, by leveraging the data that we have, we may be able to determine that a company’s smaller suppliers could benefit from a virtual P-Card.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, treasurers are focusing on extending days payables outstanding (DPO) in order to free up working capital for their corporations, drive benefits and, in turn, get more investments into the treasury.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span>Stephanie Wolf:</span> We have a whole generation of treasurers and treasury departments who have not lived through a rising interest rate environment. So we spend a lot of time with our clients talking about how that environment impacts the deposit rates, the borrowing rates and the working capital cycle as a whole.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n3">
<p><span><strong>J.P. Jolly:</strong></span> I think treasurers also need to look at their inflows and ask how they can leverage technology to reduce outstanding receipts and collect cash faster. So it’s all about maximising your inflows, collecting faster, leveraging bank tools to pay your suppliers later, extending your cash flow and improving your working capital.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span><strong>Stephanie Wolf:</strong></span> On the inflow side, we have used AI to help when receivables come in. We have a global product used by many of our clients where, as the receipt is confirmed, we use artificial intelligence to determine where those receivables should be applied.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span><strong>Matthew Davies:</strong></span> We have some clients that previously had automated match rates of 30-35% for their incoming receivables. By deploying this type of technology, they have been able to increase the match rate to 75-80%. That is a major efficiency gain which can free up a significant amount of resources.</p>
</div>
<h4>Which trends should corporates be watching right now?</h4>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span><strong>Matthew Davies:</strong></span> Corporate treasurers should be focused on the automation opportunities that we are talking about. Beyond that, it is really about how fintechs can help drive change in the broader market place. Stephanie just gave the example around intelligent receivables, where we partnered with a fintech – I think it is interesting to watch how banks are partnering with fintechs and what that is enabling them to bring to market. We are seeing much more collaboration in the bank/fintech space.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n3">
<p><span><strong>J.P. Jolly:</strong></span> Treasurers are looking to their banking partners to innovate to help them work smarter and more efficiently. This could mean propriety bank products or partnering with fintechs.</p>
<p>Staying on top of market trends and priorities is so important to innovation. Last year, we worked with Treasury Today on the Voice of the Corporate Treasury Global Study. The study provided insight on corporate treasurer’s priorities over the next 12-18 months. Truly understanding trends and our clients’ needs is key to delivering the right solutions.</p>

<div class="person n2">
<p><span><strong>Stephanie Wolf:</strong></span> Of course, cybersecurity is applicable to every single one of our clients and it is applicable to all of us personally. So, we at BofAML have taken a global position that we are here to share information on how we think about cybersecurity – and, where we can, offer advice.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span><strong>Matthew Davies:</strong></span> You can imagine that as a large global bank, we have to spend a huge amount of time, money and resources protecting the bank every minute of every day. We try to leverage that expertise to give advice to our clients on how we protect ourselves, because it is equally applicable to them.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span><strong>Stephanie Wolf:</strong></span> And technology helps the ‘knowing your client’ relationship work much better. We have used technology to build databases that give us information on what a particular client or industry of clients or region of clients are doing. What type of receipts are we seeing? What type of payments? What is the gap between a receipt and a payment? What means of executing a payment is being used? We meet with our clients regularly and then we bring that knowledge to achieve more efficient execution.</p>
</div>
<h4>Almost an element of benchmarking there?</h4>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span><strong>Stephanie Wolf:</strong></span> It is very interesting when you try to find a comparison. Not every company is comparable to the company you might think they would be compared to. I’ll give you an example. One company might simply be a manufacturer of a product. Another might be a global manufacturer of that same product as well as six others. They are very different companies. So we try to look at their behaviour, rather than just the industry sector. That is where you start to find commonality.</p>
</div>
<h4>Let’s turn to regulation. Obviously, there are enormous regulatory pressures on your industry and, in turn, on your clients.</h4>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span><strong>Stephanie Wolf:</strong></span> I look at regulation as an opportunity for us to evolve. When I think about PSD2, the second payment services directive out of the EU – what did we do when faced with that regulation? We created an entirely new way to connect with our clients via API connectivity.</p>

<div class="person n1">
<p><span><strong>Matthew Davies:</strong></span> Regulation is both a challenge and an opportunity. It is a challenge for all banks to be able to fund growth whilst staying compliant. But the opportunity is significant and we have seen many examples of regulation driving positive change.</p>
<p>Faster payments came to the UK and it was driving a better consumer experience. We have now seen this transition towards real-time payments on a global basis. If you have full open banking and you have full real-time payments, you will probably think very differently about which banks you pick to work with in a number of different jurisdictions.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n3">
<p><span><strong>J.P. Jolly:</strong></span> Speaking of real-time payments and APIs, this really is an opportunity for corporates on the collections and receivables end. This enables them to take a real-time approach when it comes to collecting money. They may also be able to leverage APIs to connect to whichever system their clients are using and source the information they need to reconcile invoices.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span><strong>Matthew Davies:</strong></span> That is a great point. We spend a lot of time talking about the speed of the payment. Actually, one of the biggest benefits from real-time payments is the increased level of information that can be passed alongside the transaction.</p>
</div>
<h4>Is there an impact on cash flow forecasting here as well?</h4>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span><strong>Stephanie Wolf:</strong></span> Most definitely. Certainty is of great value to corporate treasurers around the world and as J.P. was saying, we are spending our technology dollars on ways to offer our clients better cash flow forecasting tools. Indeed, respondents to the Treasury Today Voice of Corporate Treasury Global Study said that the most valued service their financial services partners provide is greater transparency in the cash flow forecasting process.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span><strong>Matthew Davies:</strong></span> A number of corporate clients are thinking very differently about how they can use technology for cash flow forecasting. For example, one company has taken its bank statements and open item files from SAP, and all its history from its ERP systems, and loaded them into Watson, the cloud service from IBM. Then Watson uses AI and machine learning to deliver cash flow forecasting for the company.</p>
<p>Now this is early stages, but it is very interesting to see what you can now do with the cloud-based artificial intelligence solutions that are on the market.</p>
</div>
<h4>On a different note, another business trend is the measurement of ESG factors. How important is this and what should corporate treasury be doing in this space?</h4>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span><strong>Matthew Davies:</strong></span> You can look at this a couple of ways. I think we see it as important because for us it is very much linked with responsible growth. This means making sure we are the best employer for our employees, and using the significant resources that we have around the world to do the right thing for our clients and the communities that we operate in.</p>
<p>Recently we have started to look at our customers and try to build an ESG scorecard. Interestingly, when you look at it, around 50% of corporate treasurers are involved with and engaged in ESG programmes within their organisations. The other 50% really don’t know anything about it. And I really do think for corporate treasurers, it will be increasingly important to focus on this area – firstly because it is the right thing to do, but also because investors are focused on this topic too.</p>

<h4>What do you see as some of the winning factors for modern corporate treasury?</h4>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span><strong>Stephanie Wolf:</strong></span> The key is to stay nimble, look at how your group is organised, review the technology you use and get your processes to change as your systems change – then you will be far more successful.</p>
<p>And a second aspect that I see in the clients who are most successful, is the ability to take in information across the landscape and to have designated experts, both externally and internally.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span><strong>Matthew Davies:</strong></span> Yes, you need good advisors around you and to make sure you have got the right relationships with the right banks that give you the right level of advice and service. I also think the modern treasurer needs to be both proactive and intellectually curious.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n3">
<p><span><strong>J.P. Jolly:</strong></span> People are very focused on running a proposal process and maybe on selecting the best price – but that is not always the best indicator in terms of how easy it is going to be do business with a particular provider.</p>
</div>
<h4>What else should corporates be watching?</h4>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span><strong>Stephanie Wolf:</strong></span> Technology is a must in this day and age. If you are a treasury group that is not technologically proficient, you will fail.</p>
<p>Another important industry trend is open banking, which is leading to more cross-border low-value payments. Beyond technology, the biggest change for my clients over the next five or six years is going to be low-value, cross-border, cross-currency payments becoming cost effective and, therefore, more prevalent.</p>
</div>
<h4>So corporate treasury has to be curious, nimble, but also proactive. How do you help your clients do that?</h4>
<figure class="portrait left" style="float:right;margin:0 0 2em 2em;">
<img alt="Portrait of J.P. Jolly" height="225" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/perspectives/opinions/2018-09and10-tt-08-rt__hubert-jolly__img_9450__200x225.jpg?la=en&amp;hash=91863EF15AAAC9F0BA9EE85EB8486A92" width="200"/>

<div class="person n3">
<p><span><strong>J.P. Jolly:</strong></span> Well, I think some of our most successful clients in terms of freeing up working capital are the ones who partner with procurement in a collaborative way. Traditional banks look at these three products – supply chain, payments and cards – as three separate silos. We don’t. We take an integrated approach to include all of a company’s suppliers in a single implementation.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span><strong>Stephanie Wolf:</strong></span> The first time we implemented our Digital Disbursements solution, it came out of a whiteboard session where we spent an entire afternoon sitting with an insurance company’s department head, thinking about the future of paying insurance claims. And that led to the execution of a particular solution – which, in turn, led to a rather dramatic change in the industry as to how claims are paid as well as unearned premiums.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span><strong>Matthew Davies:</strong></span> In another case, really understanding some of the challenges of the sales organisation was key. The company’s sales organisation had a number of clients that wanted to buy a lot more products – but the sales organisation was unable to sell more products to them because of customer limits which were included in the internal credit policy.</p>
<p>Of course, if you can identify the cash and apply it quicker, you can free up that credit limit quicker and therefore sell more product. But it’s also important to consider what you know about your customers and whether you have the right view and the right limits in place.</p>
<p>By looking at how the company’s clients paid, the company was able to adjust its credit limits and sell more, while still maintaining the same risk profile that it had previously. This is a great example of a treasurer taking a commercial view and helping the organisation be more successful in selling to its clients.</p>
</div>
<h4>I would like you to summarise. What are the key takeaways that you would like to leave with the reader?</h4>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span><strong>Matthew Davies:</strong></span> I am very much of the view that transaction banking is going to change more in the next five years than it has in the last 35 years.</p>
<p>There will be significant opportunity for efficiency gains, cost reductions, greater transparency and better advice driven by data. We’ll continue to do our part in providing advice on a consistent basis across all of these areas, but I think there has got to be that intellectual curiosity there.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span><strong>Stephanie Wolf:</strong></span> One thing that is constant is change. Treasurers have to be willing to look at the landscape, take all the information they can and apply it to their specific circumstances.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n3">
<p><span><strong>J.P. Jolly:</strong></span> The right approach is to look at how digitisation helps us improve the client experience that we provide to our clients.</p>
<p>Whenever I meet with my colleagues in operations, service, fulfilments or implementation, they measure themselves based on client delight. So, one major trend that treasurers should look at is what are my banks doing to make it easier for me to do business with them?</p>
<p>This discussion highlights that while customer needs and the client experience remain paramount, recent developments and the evolving landscape are continuing to change the needs and challenges faced by treasurers. It’s clear that corporate treasurers are operating in interesting, not just difficult, times and that the coming years will see the arrival of many more examples of innovation and collaborative solutions.</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p><em>After decades in the doldrums, AI has graduated from Hollywood to the headlines. It has even entered our daily lives and may be poised to threaten our jobs. But before we get too excited about early retirement, it is probably worth looking in more detail at the substance and the hype.</em></p>
<p>The initial premise of AI was that we can programme computers to process information in the same way that humans do. Sounds reasonable. But this premise ignores two critical realities. Firstly, we have almost no clue how humans function from a cognitive, psychological, and even physical perspective. Even today, with lots of fancy kits like fMRI scanners and decades of research, we are only just beginning to map some basic brain processes like vision (which very quickly turns out to be very complicated).</p>
<p>Secondly, wetware (neurons in living brains) is very different from hardware (silicon transistors in chips). Neural nets were originally designed to mimic wetware but turned out to be more useful for flexibly crunching lots of statistics. There is some promise of computing with DNA. Quantum computing is essentially many more binary computations at once. Impressive as it is, silicon remains good at doing massive numbers of simple calculations, and there is little likelihood that increasing scale will make silicon more like wetware.</p>
<h3 id="artificial-intelligence">Artificial intelligence</h3>
<p>Whereas the pioneers apparently thought that artificial intelligence might somehow imitate human intelligence, the understanding of AI has changed now. It is no longer about mimicking human intelligence but rather about creating a new kind of intelligence.</p>
<p>Last century AI was about imbuing a machine with life skills, which we now call broad AI. Current projects focus on specific skill sets such as recognising cats in images or winning a game of go, which is called narrow AI. Each individual narrow AI is excellent at a small task, and when specific narrow AIs are combined the result could seem to approach human intelligence. Combine vision with language processing and some empathy algorithms and AI is ready to pass the Turing test.</p>
<h3 id="broad-artificial-intelligence">Broad artificial intelligence</h3>
<p>Having established that AI is artificial, namely that AI is a different kind of intelligence than human intelligence, the next issue is to determine if AI is likely to achieve broad intelligence. Current AI, remarkable as it is, is very focussed on narrow data sets and specific outcomes.</p>
<p>There are lots of case studies describing how some form of AI discovered new patterns in big data that help companies to improve and sell more products. Careful reading shows that this kind of pattern discovery is guided by and mediated through data scientists and data analysts. In other words, AI can be very good at answering (some) questions, but we still need humans to figure out what questions to ask.</p>
<p>Also, correlation does not imply causation. Some data patterns are just coincidences and/or do not make clear the real actionable pattern of causation needed to make business decisions. Again, human judgement is required to make sense of the answers generated by AI.</p>
<p>In other words, to be useful in the wonderful wide-open world, AI needs human hand holding. This may sound reassuringly like needing a database administrator (DBA) to manage your Structured Query Language (SQL) database, but even if AI is not self-sufficient it represents a major shift in the kind of handholding required. AI can produce surprising results, and humans must be intellectually prepared and emotionally ready to deal with the surprises.</p>
<h3 id="intelligence">Intelligence</h3>
<p>From the forgoing, it is clear that AI is different from human intelligence and that it can be superior in narrow domains. Looking at the dictionary definition of intelligence – “the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills” – it seems that if we simply add a narrowing rider such as “in a specific domain”, the term AI may not be misleading. The tech industry, presumably mindful of the doldrums of AI last century, prefer less dramatic terms such as “machine learning”, “neural nets”, and “predictive algorithms”, even though AI seems a reasonable description according to the dictionary.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is not definitional, but rather to describe how this cluster of new technologies around AI might impact treasurers in their day to day lives. If machine learning and predictive algorithms appear intelligent, it is because they feed on huge quantities of data to learn. In practical terms, the AI that is likely to impact treasurers in the foreseeable future is a nexus of massive quantities of data and sophisticated statistical techniques ranging from Bayesian math to neural nets.</p>
<h3 id="big-data">Big Data</h3>
<p>AI feeds off data and happily for AI we are generating exponentially increasing amounts of data. These can be aggregated and meaningfully trawled by big data technologies. And better still, we are increasingly able to dump in any old unstructured data into the AI nexus and get curious and maybe even meaningful insights.</p>
<p>Because AI feeds off data, scale matters. This has implications for corporations in an increasingly competitive world. First, corporations must start mining their data as soon as possible. Second, some corporations simply have more data than others – companies like Google, Alibaba, and Tencent have data volumes that few can match, and this gives them a competitive advantage in the intelligence race.</p>
<p>To choose a domain adjacent to treasury, Alibaba uses its huge trove of goods and settlement data to offer competitive financing to merchants on its platform. Because their trade goes across its platform, Alibaba sees sales, collections and customer satisfaction with a breadth and depth that allow it to know its customers with an intimacy that banks can only dream of. Better customer intimacy allows Alibaba to fund its merchants more cheaply and more profitably than banks. The outlook for banks, who even if willing will not be able to replicate Alibaba’s platform and scale, is bleak.</p>
<p>The same applies, or will apply, in other domains. The largest players with the most data will be have the best trained neural nets – they will be the most (machine) intelligent players – and they will have a substantial competitive advantage. And whilst some collaboration around data may provide a way forward, a more likely scenario may be that smaller businesses are forced onto market leaders’ platforms to get access to clients and pertinent machine intelligence.</p>
<h3 id="rpa">RPA</h3>
<p>Robotic process automation (RPA) is not AI though some implementations are AI augmented. RPA refers to software “robots” that basically screen scrape data from one system, possibly process the data in some way, and then input the data to another system. It brings hope of linking disparate systems – such as Excel and ERP – without multiyear IT projects to figure out and implement APIs.</p>
<p>RPA can also use AI to process the data it has scraped from one system before it enters it into another. In some cases, this can mean significant decision making such as approve or reject decisions. RPA can also be the interface from AI platforms to legacy systems in many instances.</p>
<h3 id="talent">Talent</h3>
<p>The plausible way forward is human machine collaboration. No doubt we will see meta AIs managing some early generation AIs, but for the foreseeable future AIs will not be formulating meta goals of their own. Treasuries that have already implemented RPAs, or who have modern API based systems that obviate RPAs, know that the days of cutting and pasting and reconciliation drudgery are numbered.</p>
<p>Other areas that are ripe for AI disruption may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Credit analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FX hedge optimisation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cash management optimisation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all of the examples are strictly speaking AI but as we have seen there is a blurry line between advanced statistics and AI in practice, so at least they show the direction in which the profession is headed.</p>
<p>Treasurers do not necessarily need to become data scientists but they need to be comfortable enough to feed and interpret AI systems, just as treasurers do not necessarily need to be ace programmers today but they need to be able to use and interpret Excel spreadsheets and key financial formulae.</p>
<p>This learning journey is complicated by the fluidity of the field, which brings risks of learning the wrong tool and difficulty finding guides along the way. Just as VisiCalc and Lotus expertise was not wasted when Excel came along, any experience even with AI platforms that eventually lose out commercially, will still help treasurers to understand what the technology can and cannot do.</p>
<h3 id="specialisation">Specialisation</h3>
<p>Specialisation has been a good career move. Treasury itself would be seen by many to be a specialisation. Some specialisations such as compliance and data science remain attractive – although one has to wonder for how long.</p>
<p>Given that the mechanics of treasury – copy/paste, reconciliation, credit analysis, FX hedging, et al – will increasingly slip into the domain of AI, treasurers will be increasingly required to use human and AI interfacing skills.</p>
<p>Human skills will remain hard for AI to master – though AI may help train and support human skills – and it is unlikely that AI will build local entity buy in for new banking arrangements (assuming that local entities still exist).</p>
<p>And as stated above, AI hand holding – the ability to feed and interpret AI – will become a key skill for treasurers. In this context, treasurers will need to be competent generalists rather than specialists. Even specialisations that are currently in demand like compliance will eventually become heavily data focussed – no human will be able to remember all the rules to which corporations must adhere, so knowing how to get the right answers from extensive data will become more important than knowing all the rules.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>In the last edition of Treasury Today Asia, I wrote about how efficient cash management leaves open the question of what treasurers should do with the cash concentrated through their balance management efforts. Recently there has been more press about whether corporates’ excess cash means working capital and cash efficiency no longer matters. Efficiency emphatically still matters – here’s why.</em></p>
<p> Capital structure is one of the basic elements of any business set up because the capital structure determines the business’ risk capacity. Other than rent seeking, risk is a prerequisite for reward (and even rent seeking carries political risks).</p>
<p>Traditionally capital structure is part of business resilience and sustainability. Businesses need a mix of equity, debt and cash to protect the business from adverse change – this is partly a board level management decision and partly a matter of market inputs since the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) curve gives the optimal leverage for the business.</p>
<p>Simply put, equity is risk free in the sense that it never has to be repaid but it is very expensive. And debt is riskier because it must be repaid and interest payments must be paid on time but it is cheaper and additionally interest is tax deductible (whereas dividends are not). However, as leverage increases, debt becomes riskier to lenders and its cost rises for the borrower. Longer-term debt is less risky because there is more time to earn cash to repay it but it is more expensive.</p>
<p>Cash is part of a business’ financial flexibility – cash saves the business from having to raise external funding in times of difficulty. But cash is very expensive because yield on cash is very low and the cost of funding it is WACC (not the cost of borrowing alone). So investors value modest cash balances for sustainability, but the cost of high cash balances exceeds their benefit in terms of lower WACC.</p>
<p>The agency problem that is at the heart of businesses with shareholders is also addressed by appropriate capital structure – shareholders and the board (who are supposed to represent them) can “keep management honest” by requiring high leverage relative to the business risk and low cash.</p>
<h3 id="corporate-cash-exceeds-usd5trn-globally">Corporate cash exceeds US$5trn globally</h3>
<p>Given the traditional approach to capital structure, how can we explain the huge amounts of corporate cash that is reported in the news so much? And why are investors tolerating such seemingly inefficient levels of cash? Here are some factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Fragmented market:</h5>
<p>Corporate debt is also very high, so looking at net cash may reduce the apparent anomaly; further it seems that the excess cash is very concentrated in tech and pharma, so it may be inappropriate to generalise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Subpart-F:</h5>
<p>US corporates leave cash abroad because it would be taxed 30% on repatriation; or they wait for tax holidays that come once a decade – hence the large tech companies having huge cash balances (abroad) and borrowing cheap debt (in USA) to fund share repurchases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>GFC:</h5>
<p>The global financial crisis, which caused liquidity fears in many markets, may have scared corporates into holding more cash as (albeit expensive) self-insurance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Rise of knowledge businesses:</h5>
<p>There is evidence that high R&amp;D businesses need and keep more cash than traditional asset heavy businesses; an interesting NBER paper suggests that tech start-ups use more cash initially and may return it when they turn cash-positive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Competitive advantage:</h5>
<p>Some researchers find that high cash buffers confer a competitive advantage to businesses and further discourage competitors with less cash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Governance:</h5>
<p>Investors may be tolerating high cash levels – at least in developed countries– because they trust management (relatively) more than alternatives; a related view is that since managers have better information than investors they may be able to generate higher returns for the cash.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It may also be possible that the trend is reversing or at least stabilising. News reports indicate that other businesses with large cash reserves may follow Apple’s lead in returning excess cash to shareholders – this is in the context of Apple repatriating US$252bn to take advantage of the current US tax amnesty. In this period of exceptional profitability and cash flow, businesses may be feeling less need to hold large cash buffers.</p>
<p>In summary, we can observe that at least some businesses are holding historically unusual cash balances that we cannot explain with traditional economic and corporate theory.</p>
<h3 id="finding-the-right-capital-structure">Finding the right capital structure</h3>
<p>Treasurers are now faced with a conundrum – the traditional tools for determining an appropriate capital structure may no longer be working and new generally accepted practice has not resolved to replace them.</p>
<p>In principal – at least for public companies – letting the market provide answers would seem the logical choice. However, treasurers will be rightly reluctant to run experiments in the markets with their capital structure.</p>
<p>Fortunately, simulations can stand in for market experiments. One common solution is to use rating agency methodologies to find an effective capital structure, based on the not unreasonable notion that rating agencies reflect market norms. In fact, enlightened boards often specify a target rating to their treasurers rather than specific quantitative limits. Another alternative is to ask investors what they expect from the business in terms of capital structure. And of course, there is always the old standby which is following peers.</p>
<p>Whatever cash level or range is decided by the board should be followed by treasury. In good years or quarters, cash in excess of the decided range (or implied by the target rating) should be returned to shareholders.</p>
<h3 id="working-capital-and-cash-management">Working capital and cash management</h3>
<p>Large cash holdings come in part from tight working capital and cash management. They are not a reason to loosen capital efficiency. As quoted earlier, cash is, from an investor perspective, a liability. Investors know that profits are illusory and that value for them is generated from cash flow – so they will continue to focus on cash efficiency regardless of cash balances.</p>
<p>Investors value capital-efficient businesses higher than inefficient ones, so the focus on capital efficiency remains critical. There are many suitable metrics available (ROIC, RONA, EVA and NWCR) – it matters less which one is used than that one of them is used to keep the focus on capital efficiency throughout the business.</p>
<h3 id="investing-cash">Investing cash</h3>
<p>Once the board has determined either directly or by specifying a target rating the target cash range, treasury needs to invest the cash appropriately. Invariably treasury’s investment objectives are: safety (preservation of capital); liquidity (availability of funds); and yield (interest income).</p>
<p>In that order. In fact, several surveys show that treasurers put 60% of their effort into safety, 30% into liquidity, and only 10% into yield. The emphasis is firmly on maintaining access to the cash rather than profiting from it (because cash is a huge cost in any case when counted against WACC).</p>
<p>Treasurers have a range of investment products that can be used to safely store cash, including: bank deposits; money market funds; supply chain financing; segregated accounts; and self investing.</p>
<h4 id="bank-deposits">Bank deposits</h4>
<p>Bank deposits are becoming less easy with the advent of Basel III and especially NSFR and LCR which mean that banks are reluctant to take short-term deposits. When a bank deposit has to be committed for 60 or more days, treasurers are not meeting the liquidity objective stated earlier.</p>
<p>One interesting development from these regulations is that banks are remunerating current account balances that qualify as operating cash with deposit like rates, so that doing nothing with your cash becomes an attractive option. Of course, leaving cash with banks (whether in deposit or current accounts) represents a risk concentration that may compromise the safety objective stated above.</p>
<h4 id="money-market-funds">Money market funds (MMF)</h4>
<p>MMFs have become increasingly popular with treasurers because they offer good risk diversification and high liquidity (often same day availability and routinely next day availability). This popularity is enhanced with the regulatory challenges of bank deposits above.</p>
<p>Regulations are also affecting MMFs. Treasurers prefer CNAV funds but regulatory and accounting pressures are pushing the industry towards VNAV funds which create more accounting complexity and can generate accounting classification issues.</p>
<h4 id="supply-chain-financing">Supply chain financing (SCF)</h4>
<p>Cash rich businesses are increasingly deploying their cash to support their supply chains with techniques like dynamic discounting. The effective yield and relatively low risk are attractive but there may be difficulties with the liquidity target (cash tied up in shorter accounts payables cannot easily be liberated and disrupting suppliers may be disruptive to the underlying business) and the impact on working capital metrics (shorter accounts payables) may not be flattering unless well communicated.</p>
<h4 id="segregated-accounts">Segregated accounts</h4>
<p>Segregated accounts often seem like an attractive and tailor-made solution, but they are only viable for very large cash balances, for example over US$100m.</p>
<h4 id="self-investing">Self investing</h4>
<p>Only the largest treasuries can justify the expense and managerial overhead of running investment operations in house. Further, it is difficult to get risk diversification with any but the largest balances – and this problem is resolved with MMFs which can be thought of as a way to outsource investment to more professional larger scale institutions.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Capital structure and the consequent cash level decisions have become more complicated in the current low interest rate environment. This may prove to be the new normal but for now treasurers do not yet have established models and maths to guide them. Nonetheless, tight working capital and cash management remain critical for firms because investors need to be paid from cash flow. Determining the appropriate cash levels and communicating them to investors is a key foundational element of treasury and indeed business effectiveness. Cash investment remains a non-core activity focussed on damage limitation rather than yield.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>The most effective route to efficient cash management is to minimise banking – balances at banks and flows through banks – because such third-party interactions inevitably increase both risks and costs.</em></p>
<p> My guiding principle for treasury metrics is Cost Effective Risk Reduction (CERR). Treasury covers a variety of financial risks such as liquidity (in the sense of cash availability), price risk (foreign exchange, interest rates et al), operational risk and so forth. Non-financial businesses want to minimise non-core risks like financial risks so that they can allocate more capital (which translates to risk capacity) to their core business.</p>
<p>The treasurer’s role is to reduce the non-financial risks in the most cost-effective way. A classic example of balancing risk and cost is capital structure. A fully equity funded firm with huge cash reserves will be very low risk, but it will also have a high weighted average cost of capital (WACC) that will materially reduce its competitiveness. On the other hand, highly leveraged firms are riskier, even though they should have a lower WACC (subject to the WACC curve).</p>
<p>The right capital structure depends on the riskiness of the underlying business, and there is no best solution – though the market may provide valuable input through equity and debt pricing. Capital structure is a strategic board level decision.</p>
<p>Cash management is far more generic across most businesses. In the end, all need to collect cash from customers, to pay suppliers and to manage the resulting balances efficiently. Ideally cash would just be a utility like electricity or water. The objective is to reduce costs and risks – and fortunately both can be achieved together.</p>
<p>Cash management can be usefully split into balance management and flow management. For balances, we want to concentrate all our cash into one global balance available for investment according to policy. For flows, we want to minimise the cost and operational risk of payments and collections. These objectives are best achieved by minimising banking.</p>
<h3 id="less-banking-equals-more-cerr">Less banking = more CERR</h3>
<p>From a balance perspective, if you exclude the market cost of funding the business’ net debt (which is a strategic board decision outside the scope of cash management), most of the cost and risk come from maintaining bank balances.</p>
<p>Banks need to charge cost of capital and margins for use of balance sheet. This means there is a substantial spread paid by businesses that maintain both credit and debit balances with banks (including account balances, loans, and deposits).</p>
<p>Pooling cash into one global balance eliminates this spread, and is normally the biggest cost saving that comes from efficient cash management. Pooling also eliminates many risks – both operational and credit – that are associated with dispersed bank balances.</p>
<p>In a similar way, making payments through the banking system incurs bank fees, loss of float, and (for cross border) foreign exchange spreads. Making payments through the banking system is also risky – not so much because of the banks themselves but because the interface between corporates and banks introduces multiple risks.</p>
<p>The best way to reduce both costs and risks is to minimise the number of flows going through the banking system. For example, intercompany flows can be settled through payment netting or in-house bank (IHB). Third-party flows can be minimised through aggregation (payment factory) and on behalf of (OBO) structures. The benefits from eliminating or at least reducing banking are far greater than what can be derived from haggling over fees and spreads.</p>

<h3 id="balance-cerr">Balance CERR</h3>
<p>As explained above, the goal of balance management is one global cash balance – we can apply the Pareto 80/20 principle here regarding cash in regulated countries; but even there the same principle applies domestically. For those who have not implemented full IHB, and therefore still have bank balances, there are three main issues that can be addressed by various balance management tools as follows:</p>
<p>For simplicity, the table above does not include intercompany loans (functionally equivalent to manual ZBA, or ZBA as intercompany loans automated by a bank) or interest optimisation (a partial concentration suitable for regulated countries).</p>
<p>The table makes clear that optimal balance management will often require a mix of tools – for example, sweeps to move cash from operating bank accounts to notional overlay bank accounts.</p>
<p>IHB (done properly with OBO so that there is only one account per currency across the group) does an excellent job, but does not automate pooling across currencies. For that reason, many IHBs operate a notional pool as an overlay across their currency balances – multi currency accounts can also serve a similar function.</p>
<h3 id="flow-cerr">Flow CERR</h3>
<p>From a flow perspective, the objective is to minimise the flows through the banking system. This normally targets two types of flows – intercompany and third party.</p>
<p>Intercompany flows can be eliminated with payment netting and with IHB. Payment netting reduces intercompany flows to one per entity per month. IHB eliminates intercompany flows altogether, because they become book entries across the entities’ intercompany current accounts with the IHB.</p>
<p>Third-party flows can be sharply reduced through aggregation and lowest cost routing, which is what most payment factories and IHBs do. Aggregation reduces the number of flows, and lowest cost routing reduces their cost by executing them as domestic payments (like what banks call cross border ACH) – these comments may not apply to industries that have industry wide net settlement arrangements in place such as airlines and telecoms.</p>
<h3 id="keeping-things-simple">Keeping things simple</h3>
<p>As shown, the most effective route to CERR in cash management is less banking. This is not a criticism of banks – the risks and costs of banking arise from the third-party relationship and are exacerbated by bank regulation. It is more about keeping things simple – not making a payment is simpler than making one – and complexity inevitably increases risk and cost.</p>
<p>It may be interesting to consider how this model will need revision when everyone has accounts with and makes payments through central banks, but that will take a while, so for now less banking equates to better cash management. <br class="t-last-br"/>

<h3 id="invisible-banking">Invisible banking</h3>
<p>Piyush Gupta, CEO at DBS was the keynote speaker at the most recent ACTS/ATC Forum in Singapore. DBS’ mantra of “joyful banking” has always irked me. I feel that banking is about execution of primary transactions that are important to me – I don’t feel happy about a mortgage, it’s the house that excites me; when I buy a product or service that I want, I just want the payment to go through without hassle.</p>
<p>So it was great to hear Piyush proclaiming that his goal for corporate banking is that it should be invisible – integrated seamlessly into business processes to reduce friction to the minimum that is secure. Invisible banking is a goal I can get excited about!</p>
<h3 id="treasury-technology-penetrating-asia-at-last">Treasury technology penetrating Asia at last</h3>
<p>Asia has traditionally been a laggard in adopting treasury technology – penetration rates for SWIFT connectivity, TMS and eFX are generally lower than in Europe and the USA. So ACTS decided we should have debates on TMS vs XLS and eFX vs phone to stimulate discussion.</p>
<p>The debates were hilarious, even if the poor treasurers who ended up debating for XLS and phone were not true Luddites, they did a great job of getting into their roles.</p>
<p>And the results were very positive for the more technically inclined amongst us. On TMS, two thirds of treasurers were pro TMS. Good news for TMS vendors, and treasury efficiency in Asia going forward. Interestingly, TMS clearly have room to improve on the ease of use/flexibility front since half of TMS users still rely on XLS as well.</p>
<p>Similar data but different story on eFX. Ninety one percent of treasurers were pro eFX after the debate, but usage lags this enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Two thirds of treasurers use eFX, but half of those still need the phone as well. The reason is that, with many emerging markets in Asia, many Asian treasurers feel that they still need to deal EM FX the old way. India used to have a bank cartel (FEDAI) blocking eFX and many treasurers are not aware that RBI issued clear instructions encouraging eFX a few years ago. (There is a similar and equally wrong idea that SWIFT is not allowed in India; RBI also cleared this up a few years ago, and in fact the latest INR clearing systems use ISO 20022 messaging.)</p>
<p>I recently checked the status of eFX in Vietnam for a client and learned all three eFX platform providers I asked are active there. Honestly, I was surprised. It is a good indication that phone dealing is rapidly heading towards redundancy in Asia.</p>
<h3 id="the-limits-of-quantitative-economics">The limits of quantitative economics</h3>
<p>I also had the pleasure of co-chairing EuroFinance in Barcelona. The conference’s first plenary speaker, Pippa Malmgren, had many challenging observations to share. Given her background as an economist, I found her warnings about the limitations of quantitative analysis bracing.</p>
<p>Paraphrasing, she suggested that we need to supplement quantitative analysis with something along the lines of ‘common sense’. When the numbers do not make sense, we trust them at our peril. She cited plenty of examples from the past decade to support her assertion.</p>
<p>I am a big fan of fact based decision making. Equally I have seen that many quantitative techniques we rely on in treasury have significant limitations. Hence, we supplement value-at-risk with stress tests, and hedge optimisation with common sense.</p>
<p>Conversely, I think it is very helpful to challenge gut feeling and common sense with hard data. So, I suppose my conclusion is we need holistic and open-minded decision making.</p>
<h3 id="will-treasury-be-freed-or-terminated">Will treasury be freed or terminated?</h3>
<p>The second morning kicked off with an engaging discussion of the implications of AI and machine learning for treasurers. (The conference theme was “intelligent treasury”, and these days the word intelligent seems to be more associated with machines than with people.)</p>
<p>Long story short, the clear conclusions were first that AI will not be that intelligent for a while, even if its advances in specific domains such as facial identification and go are impressive, and second that treasurers will need to learn to work with AI more than risk being supplanted by it.</p>
<p>On why we still need treasurers, the blackbox issue came up – basically software is a blackbox and we cannot be sure what it is doing or why, so human sanity checking is a valid mitigant.</p>
<p>The clear upside is that simple improvements like robotic process automation will relieve us of the boring routine work and free us up for more interesting and higher value-added contributions to our companies.</p>
<h3 id="technology-and-what-really-matters">Technology and what really matters</h3>
<p>The rest of the second morning focussed on many of the buzzwords that seem so urgent. Big data can help us find interesting patterns in heterogenous data, potentially offering a way forward without the pain of restructuring our data.</p>
<p>Blockchain may advance industry wide collaboration to the benefit of all, even if its power may be more in an idea around which banks can collaborate rather than in the technology itself. (Banks are mainly working on permissioned (ie private closed loop) blockchains, which are functionally more like SWIFT or DTCC, rather than permission-less blockchains like bitcoin where no one is in charge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AI will not be that intelligent for a while, even if its advances in specific domains such as facial identification and go are impressive, and second that treasurers will need to learn to work with AI more than risk being supplanted by it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Refreshingly, Simon Taylor from 11:FS cut through the hype and stated that, for corporate treasurers, the first widely used blockchain is at least 18 months away and will probably be in the trade space.</p>
<p>A panel on fintech clearly confirmed that the term is practically meaningless – fintech is being done by banks, by large companies (ApplePay, AliPay et al), and by startups. To paraphrase Deng Xiao Ping: it does not matter who does it, so long as it works.</p>
<p>My big take away is that technology does not matter, solutions matter. We need to focus on clear articulations of pain points (jobs to be done, problems to be solved), and then let the experts come up with solutions. Wanting to trial a specific technology may seem sexy, but it is probably a recipe for higher cost and lower benefits.</p>
<h3 id="disrupting-banks">Disrupting banks</h3>
<p>Brett King kicked off the third day at EuroFinance. While getting miked up he showed me his digital bank, Moven, which is more like a slick and mobile first personal finance site than a bank. I especially liked that Moven uses APIs to connect with other banks (in the USA) to give a holistic view of personal cash.</p>
<p>Brett’s presentation focused on corporate banking, rather than Moven which is retail. One of his mantras is first principles design. To reduce the cost per kilo to orbit by 95%, SpaceX had to start with a clean slate. This is very hard for incumbents to do. Many bank CEOs want their organisations to disrupt themselves, but the operational realities of staying compliant and maintaining trust are antagonistic to disruption.</p>
<p>A good illustration is SWIFT’s gpi, which will undoubtedly improve the classic four corner correspondent banking approach to payments – if only by enforcing decent existing practice on participating banks. It took an outsider – Ripple – to completely re-imagine international payments.</p>
<p>In China, where tech companies have been particularly aggressive in finance, banks are already out of the game in many spaces. Alipay’s YueBao is the world’s largest money market fund. One bank CEO said, “We have already lost payments (to the tech companies), so what can we save now?”</p>
<p>The tension between the compliant and trusted status quo and the need for disruption to make significant improvements will be an interesting space to watch over the next few years.</p>
<h3 id="risk-management-learnings">Risk management learnings</h3>
<p>The risk stream at EuroFinance provided some great case studies and panel discussions. The first afternoon revolved around FX hedging.</p>
<p>This was ably kicked off with a beautifully clear explanation from Vincent Delort, Risk and Reporting Manager at JTI of how to do cash flow at risk (CF&amp;R) in Excel – down to the actual Excel formulae. In case you are wondering whether this was too technical for most conference audiences, the room was packed and we barely managed to get through one tenth of the questions during Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>One question we did get to was why use Excel for CF@R rather than a TMS. The answer was that none of the TMS CF@R solutions is sufficiently flexible to meet JTI’s needs. Another opportunity for the TMS vendors to up their game.</p>

<p>When the Irish Association of Corporate Treasurers (IACT) formed in 1987, only a handful of treasury centres resided in the country. Today, Ireland is one of the world’s foremost treasury destinations, playing host to the European treasury centres of many of the world’s largest corporations.</p>
<p>There have been many factors contributing to the growth of Ireland’s position as a global treasury hub. One factor that cannot be overlooked is the role the IACT has played in promoting and formalising the profession in the country.</p>
<p>Jimmy Doyle, one of the founders of the IACT and its third president explains: “When myself, Gerry English and Aengus Murphy formed the Association, our primary objective was to educate the corporate sector in Ireland about the benefits of prudent financial risk management and the value a professional corporate treasury department could deliver.” But there was a more protective element at work here too. He continues: “We wanted to make sure that the treasury profession in Ireland had a collective voice to articulate the requirements of treasurers and to ensure that the banks delivered the appropriate products.”</p>
<p>In the early years, the IACT also started playing a crucial role in educating treasury professionals. “We ran a course in treasury management at Dublin City University,” explains Doyle. “Over 350 treasury professionals have graduated from this course and they form the basis of a well-educated and talented treasury community here in Ireland.”</p>
<p>The status of the IACT as an educator has increased as the treasury profession has developed over the past 30 years. Stuart Kirk, Director, Group Treasury at Xerox and former IACT President, says that this educational role proved vital during the financial crisis, providing Ireland’s treasury professionals with the skill set to deal with the challenges ahead.</p>
<p>“The true value of the IACT really came to the fore during this time,” says Kirk. “The networks that were created through the Association meant that no matter what the issue, treasurers had peers they could speak to, sounding out their ideas and finding the path to the right solution. These networks have continued to be important post-crisis as the role of treasury has expanded in all organisations and gained a seat at the top table.”</p>
<p>Today, the IACT is central to the treasury landscape in Ireland. Its primary objectives remain to educate the treasury community and facilitate networking between treasury professionals in the country.</p>
<p>“The modern treasurer should be curious, constantly learning and adapting how they work to meet the changing needs of the businesses they serve,” says Lorcan Travers, Senior Investment Manager at Johnson &amp; Johnson and current President of the IACT. “The role of the IACT today is to cut through the noise. This will help ensure that our members are informed about the topics that matter to them, allowing them to continue offering value to the business.” The IACT is, he adds, also always ready to “facilitate conversation, providing treasury professionals in Ireland with a network of peers who they can turn to for advice and benchmark themselves against”.</p>
<p>Networking and encouraging debate around latest treasury topics and industry megatrends are high on the agenda for the upcoming IACT Corporate Treasury &amp; Cash Management Conference. “We will cover the full gamut of topics presented by many overseas speakers, ranging from technical treasury skills to the impact fintech will have on the profession,” says Travers. “The conference will be interactive, with different formats facilitating audience participation,” he explains. “I encourage all members of the IACT to come along to the event on 15th November at Croke Park, Dublin.”</p></div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4>What have been your initial impressions since beginning your new role in Asia Pacific?</h4>
<p>Over the past three decades, Asia Pacific has been the world’s most dynamic region. Its dramatic economic growth and increasing population have provided corporates with an unrivalled opportunity to grow their businesses. Many multinationals have taken full advantage of this opportunity, with Asia now accounting for a large portion of revenues.</p>
<p>Today, we stand on the cusp of a new dawn in the region, one defined by changing economic, demographic and technological forces. Forces that are unveiling another layer of untapped growth potential.</p>
<p>Crucial to this opportunity is the region’s growing middle class, with an insatiable appetite for consumer goods, technology and services. This is transforming the global consumer landscape and by 2020 we expect that China, India and Indonesia will represent the largest, third largest and eighth largest middle-class markets in the world.</p>
<p>Increasing internet usage and the penetration of ever-cheaper connected mobile devices are enabling access to this thriving consumer base by corporates. As a result, eCommerce is rapidly becoming the primary sales strategy for companies seeking to grow in the region. To put this opportunity into perspective, the value of eCommerce here is expected to be US$2.6trn by 2020.</p>
<p>To meet the changing needs of Asia’s thriving consumer base, multinational corporates are transforming their business models as they look to become local players in the markets in which they operate. At the same time, we are seeing Asian corporates taking advantage of this opportunity, moving out of their home markets and becoming regional and multinational champions.</p>
<p>In both cases, Citi is well placed to support corporates’ growth ambitions. Asia is a vital region for the Citi franchise and the bank has been active here since 1902. It has a deep presence in all the key markets. We are therefore equally adept at supporting multinational clients with their localisation strategies and eCommerce strategies as we are at helping emerging Asian champions scale and tackle the challenges of doing business across multiple markets.</p>
<h4>You mention the challenges of doing business across multiple markets. How do these challenges in Asia manifest themselves?</h4>
<p>The challenges that many corporates currently face go back to the geopolitical changes witnessed over the last few years. The world order is changing. Be this because of Brexit, Trump, security issues in the Korean peninsula, or China’s increasing geographical influence (for example via overseas direct investment and Belt &amp; Road initiative); all have a ripple effect that impacts corporates and the real economy.</p>
<p>One of the first areas impacted by geopolitical instability is trade. Indeed, since the financial crisis, geopolitical instability has been present in every part of the world. As a result, global trade has failed to recover, as many initially thought it would, in the wake of the crisis. Data recently released by the ICC is consistent with this trend. It highlighted that 2016 was the weakest year for global trade since the crisis. The same year also saw half the UK population vote for Brexit and the withdrawal from the single market, essentially shunning free trade in Europe.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote><p>The multi-faceted and constantly evolving nature of these challenges means that we have had to redefine what it means to be a transaction bank.</p></blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source"></p>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Asian trade is not immune from these global trends, but the impact is less acute. This is primarily because of the large volume of intra-Asia trade. This has forged a dynamic and vibrant trading ecosystem encapsulated in the region. Intra-Asia trade is also something that we expect to see grow in the coming years, despite geopolitical uncertainty, or because of it, as corporates diversify and look to take hold of opportunities in emerging markets such as Vietnam and the Philippines.</p>
<p>The ripple effect of geopolitical instability and economic uncertainty is creating challenges for corporates in other areas, however. Most notably, it is forcing regulators in some markets to put in temporary measures that stop, or limit, a corporate’s ability to repatriate cash. This has been an issue for many of our clients who have grown used to the increasingly liberalised nature of markets such as China and Malaysia; both of whom have recently retightened currency controls.</p>
<p>Volatility in currencies, interest rates and commodities, created by the political and economic uncertainty, is also creating challenges for corporates. This volatility is making it near-impossible for corporates to accurately predict their cash flow, making it hard to ensure that liquidity is available where needed.</p>
<h4>What is Citi doing to help its clients overcome these challenges?</h4>
<p>The multi-faceted and constantly evolving nature of these challenges means that we have had to redefine what it means to be a transaction bank. No longer can we simply be a provider of banking products and services; today we must be a partner to our clients, deeply embedded in their operations, in every market they choose to operate in.</p>
<p>In practice, this means a few things. Firstly, we must ensure that we provide them with the tools that give them visibility over the exposures they face. Then together we can work in partnership to develop solutions and strategies to manage these risks.</p>
<p>Second to this, we must make sure that we are a valued source of real-time information for our clients. This is about taking our observations, knowledge and insights from all the markets that we operate in and serving these up in a contextualised and actionable form to our clients. One of the most effective ways that we have done this is to play back the data we have on our clients and their peers, to share insights on what is industry best practice, and what our clients could do to drive greater efficiency and cost savings. Also, in an environment of fast-paced local regulatory change, responding to market volatilities and geo-politics, we serve as the voice of local nuance.</p>
<p>The objective of these combined actions is to make sure that we remain relevant to our client base in this rapidly changing environment.</p>
<h4>Why is digitisation critical for Citi and what is the bank’s digital philosophy?</h4>
<p>I firmly believe that this is an unequalled moment in history for transaction banking. A decade on since the financial crisis, every bank has recognised the value of this business and the value we can bring to our clients. And today, this value is only increasing as we become more deeply embedded in the ecosystem of our clients. To harness this opportunity and stay relevant to our clients, we must forge ahead and continue to deliver innovative solutions and services.</p>
<p>Our aim is to be a global and simple bank for our clients. Digitisation enables this. That is why it is core to everything that we do today. To achieve these objectives, we are taking some lessons from the new generation of technology companies, many of whom are our clients. Although these companies operate in a wide-range of sectors, they all have four core traits. They are focused on the client experience, they are innovative, they can scale almost infinitely, and they are agile, meaning that if something does not work as intended, they can pivot to something else. It is these traits that we are embedding into the core of the bank’s culture.</p>
<p>In practice, this philosophy is borne out in several different ways. For instance, we have innovation labs around the world, including a dedicated transaction banking lab in Singapore. We very much see these as the bridge to the horizon. The aim of the work in these labs is not to disrupt, but to connect the world today with the world of tomorrow.</p>
<p>That does not mean that we are not looking to disrupt ourselves by harnessing the ideas of fintechs. In fact, Citi runs and is actively engaged in several accelerator programmes where the objective is to innovate and scale at pace with partners in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Advisory is another important part of Citi’s digital strategy. As a bank that has invested heavily in digital technology, we are a market leader across all industries. We want to use our expertise to help our clients also become market leaders. We do this by offering them insight into what we have done and how the same tools, techniques, and lessons learnt might be utilised within their own businesses.</p>
<p>One area that our clients are especially interested in now is cyber-security. In recent months, there have been numerous large-scale attacks on enterprises in the region that have seriously disrupted business. To enable them to understand this complex space, we are providing advice and holding practical sessions around best-practice in cyber-security. These sessions are proving especially popular.</p>
<h4>What digital products has the bank recently launched?</h4>
<p>It has been an exciting 12 months at Citi and we have seen many long-term projects come to fruition. For example, in February, we published a suite of transaction banking APIs. These provide our clients with a modern and innovative way to connect with and consume banking services straight from their ERP or TMS system. The power and potential of this form of connectivity will only grow. We aim to publish many more of these for different services in the coming year.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, we have solved a common pain point for treasurers by digitising the security token required to access their corporate bank accounts. Before, treasurers were required to carry a physical hardware token to generate a login passcode. Today, Citi’s MobilePASS solution allows treasurers to use their personal mobile devices for secure authentication instead.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>In another landmark, we launched the first paperless cross-border payment solution for corporates in India earlier this year. The solution, created in partnership with the Indian government, substantially reduces the time, effort and cost of each transaction by facilitating quicker trade payments.</p>
<p>Citi also continues to invest in innovative technology like blockchain. Earlier this year, we commercialised our first blockchain solution in partnership with NASDAQ. This pioneering project creates a bridge between the traditional financial system and the blockchain.</p>
<p>We are also investing in our back-end processes to enable us to better service our clients. It is early days, but we are beginning to leverage things like machine learning, AI, robotics and optical character recognition. We are already seeing the benefits that these technologies can offer in improving accuracy, reducing cost and providing much faster feedback to our clients. In the future, this will enable the development and deployment of new services for our clients.</p>
<p>It is important to mention that, no matter where we are investing, our clients are always front of mind. Increasingly, we are leaning on our clients to guide our product development. To provide an example of this, recently we showcased ten potential solutions to a group of our clients. We then asked them to pick five that would be most useful to them, and we have now begun to put these five into development.</p>
<h4>How does Citi plan to build on this and continue to support its clients in Asia in a rapidly evolving world?</h4>
<p>Across the world, the role of the treasurer is changing. They are increasingly moving away from being cash managers and becoming sales and supply-chain supporters, cyber-risk managers, tax experts and most importantly, growth-enablers for the business.</p>
<p>Considering these changes, we must continue to adapt the products and services we offer so that we may continue to drive relentless relevance in a changing world. Citi is widely regarded as the world’s best transaction bank; we must not rest on our laurels. We will, therefore, continue to invest, to allow us to deliver data, analytics and insights to our clients in real-time, presented in a relevant, contextualised and actionable way. We have made great progress towards this goal and will continue to strive towards this goal.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p><em>David Blair has had the privilege and pleasure of working on an Agile software development project this year. He says there were many similarities between this and his time working in small treasury teams. Here are some of his further observations on how Agile relates to treasury.</em></p>
<p>To me, Agile seems to be primarily a mind-set. This is characterised in the four key values outlined in in the Agile Manifesto – a document drawn up based on the combined experience of several software developers. According to the Manifesto, Agile is built on:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working software over comprehensive documentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Responding to change over following a plan.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But there are also several common themes across the many styles of Agile, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Small (single digit) tight-knit cross-functional teams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efficient communication (eg daily stand ups).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Short (typically two week) sprints delivering working functionality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bite-sized chunks of work for quick delivery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try – sometimes fail – learn.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This way of working was born from the frustration of coders with the big project engineering-based approach that was previously the default called “waterfall”. This sequential approach to building software can be slow and rigid and can sometimes lead to an unsatisfactory outcome for both software provider and client.</p>
<h3 id="agile-business">Agile business</h3>
<p>As noted, Agile started as a software development methodology, but it is now being adopted by all kinds of businesses and is even becoming a management fad. A quick scan of the web will show that marketing, customer service, and even audit (which sounds odd but why not?) can be Agile.</p>
<p>In spirit, the desire to be nimble is not new. Policies and processes help ensure consistency but often at the cost of corporate sclerosis.</p>
<p>Some banks are embracing this way of working across the entire organisation. Commonwealth Bank of Australia, for instance, recently announced that it will be 100% Agile within a year. Dutch lender ING is also undergoing its own Agile transformation. Yet while the desire to be more nimble and customer friendly is laudable, it is not clear how this will work beyond project teams. “Agile compliance” sounds like an oxymoron!</p>
<h3 id="agile-treasury">Agile treasury</h3>
<p>For me, one of the joys of treasury has always been working in small tight-knit teams. Of course, there is a downside in terms of being under-resourced and over-worked, but small teams are inherently nimble (because they have no choice) and (I think) more fun.</p>
<p>Another aspect of treasury I enjoy is making things happen and delivering results. Since I am not a very patient person, I like to see quick results. In fact, I need quick results to keep me motivated, otherwise I lose interest. So Agile is an easy sell to me – small teams delivering a regular flow of concrete results, and responding fast to changing circumstances.</p>
<p>In fact, as I learned more about Agile, I came to see that I have been doing (unstructured) Agile for decades – largely by force of circumstance and functional necessity. Based on my observations of treasuries I have worked in and with, small teams and fast changing requirements are quite typical in all but the very largest companies, so I think other treasurers will find Agile reasonably comfortable.</p>
<h3 id="learning-from-agile">Learning from Agile</h3>
<p>Even if treasury is great and arguably intrinsically agile, I found there is a lot to learn from Agile. This way of working was an early product of this century, and has blossomed in the past 17 years, producing countless branches, and generating a wealth of experience and knowledge – not to mention a whole new industry of Agile coaching.</p>
<p>Some of the Agile practices that impressed me include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Small teams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sprints and bite-size tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Velocity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rituals – stand ups and retrospectives.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="small-teams">Small teams</h3>
<p>Agile requires nimbleness and dense communication, so it works best with small teams. It is none the less scalable by combining small teams (called squads or scrums) into larger units.</p>
<p>Spotify built a corporate structure out of Agile teams by combining them into tribes (related squads), chapters (cross squad groups by skill set), and guilds (cross squad special interest groups). Matrix organisation re-worked for Agile – with accountability firmly anchored at the squad level.</p>
<h3 id="sprints">Sprints</h3>
<p>Agile is characterised by short sprints – usually one or two weeks – with concrete and defined deliverables. Sprints are key to Agile’s adaptability; if the work does not satisfy for whatever reason only two weeks have been lost, and the squad can change tack appropriately.</p>
<p>Sprints require that work is broken down into small chunks that can be done quickly with few people. This is a great way to manage progress and reduce risk.</p>
<h3 id="velocity">Velocity</h3>
<p>Velocity is a key metric in Agile. Velocity is the amount of work a squad can deliver sustainably within a sprint. It is critical to sprint planning – keeping the team fully loaded but not overloaded. Overloading results in poor quality and eventually diminishing returns as motivation flags.</p>
<p>Obviously, treasury has to respond to externalities that are often beyond its control, even if some (like quarter ends) are predictable. Nonetheless, the concept of velocity is a useful management discipline to rigorously understand the capacity of the team.</p>
<h3 id="rituals">Rituals</h3>
<p>My favourite Agile ritual is the stand-up – a daily ten-minute team meeting which is traditionally done standing up to prevent people from getting too comfortable and to encourage brevity. A stand up is a concise progress report – squad members basically share any blockers (things that might stop them delivering within the sprint) and possibly ask for help. Stand ups are strictly process oriented. Any deeper discussion is scheduled for later and normally in a smaller subgroup.</p>
<p>Of course, for a few treasurers in a small dealing room, stand ups may seem redundant. It is OK to be agile about Agile but I do think that sharing progress across the team is a great discipline. And I have always found that focussed communication leads to better and quicker outcomes.</p>
<p>Another Agile ritual that impressed me was the retrospective. A retrospective is a squad discussion at the end of each sprint about how things went and what can be improved. The team typically looks at things to stop, start and continue doing. Retrospectives act as a good prelude to sprint planning which is when the team decides what to do in the upcoming sprint.</p>
<h3 id="integrating-agile">Integrating Agile</h3>
<p>I enjoy working in the Agile methodology. As noted above, it is perhaps more than anything a mind-set. It has a lot of discipline and great risk management, but Agile discipline and risk management can appear chaotic to colleagues and partners. Integrating an Agile squad into a non-Agile organisation and with non-Agile partners can be hard.</p>
<p>The Agile approach is very nimble which means it is fluid. Not all partners like this. For example, an external vendor may find the fluidity feels like delivery risk to them. It also requires trust, and trust requires understanding, and this is not always easy to achieve. With external partners, the squad also must accept that the work may not be specified in the traditional detail, and therefore the cost will be variable. This tends to go down badly with procurement colleagues. These kinds of challenges ripple out from Agile teams embedded in non-Agile organisations.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>It will be clear from the above that I am a fan of Agile. I have really enjoyed working in an Agile team – helped no doubt by the quality of my squad mates. While small treasury teams tend to be nimble by necessity, some of the practices the Agile community have developed over the past 17 years can help anchor treasury agility and make it more robust.</p>
<p>For example, rituals like stand ups may seem unnecessary to treasurers who feel they are spontaneously agile. None the less, stand ups can systematise communication that mostly occurs naturally, and the structure makes the team more accessible for newcomers. I am suspicious of rituals becoming rote process, but properly done stand ups are designed to avoid that – if all is going swimmingly, a stand up only takes five seconds per person – enough time to say “OK”.</p></div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>Cross-border payments are currently slow, expensive and opaque. Ripple offers sub second efficiently priced payments using a variant of blockchain technology. In response, SWIFT has launched GPII, same day credit of funds, up front pricing and payment tracking. This article explores the two solutions, and what they mean for treasurers.</em></p>
<p>Currently, cross-border payments go through the 600-year-old correspondent banking system (much constrained by regulators clamping down on KYC and AML), facilitated by SWIFT messages like MT101 and ISO 20022 payment instruction (pain).</p>
<p>This requires getting six players linked up – payer, payer’s bank, payer’s bank’s correspondent, beneficiary bank’s correspondent, beneficiary bank, beneficiary.</p>
<p>Since the messages (generally) flow sequentially, and not all banks do straight through processing (STP), this takes a while. Worse, over time banks have got into the habit of sitting on our money for arbitrary lengths of time – this is called float which is a euphemism for regulator sanctioned theft. Even worse, the banks along the chain also help themselves to arbitrary and often material deductions, with confusing names like lifting fees and in lieu fees. So, when the money finally arrives, we should be grateful some of it got through the system at better than walking pace.</p>
<p>I exaggerate a little here. I do see cross-border payments going through current channels with only one (or two) fee deductions and within 24 hours. But that feels lucky. All elements of my exaggeration remain regrettably common practice.</p>
<p>And in these times of Venmo and PayPal and instant everything, this feels antediluvian. How is it that Amazon can deliver physical goods faster than banks can deliver a credit entry, which is basically a secure email – only bits and bytes?</p>
<p>In fintech parlance, this looks like a market ripe for disruption.</p>
<h3 id="ripple">Ripple</h3>
<p>Ripple is disrupting this model with sub second cross-border payments with automated best pricing from its network. Since Ripple payments are nearly instant, their model removes credit and liquidity risk from the process, thus lowering bank (and societal) costs considerably. Since the network finds the best price for exchange and liquidity, pricing is optimised and customers are no longer locked in to the wide spreads currently reflected in bank board rates.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote><p>Logically, regulators should prefer Ripple because near instant transfers vastly reduce liquidity and credit risks.</p></blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source"></p>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>The benefits for corporates are clear in terms of price and speed. Corporates will also appreciate the elimination of settlement risk. Further, Ripple uses industry standard ISO and MT messaging, and because participants are both directly and multilaterally connected there is no loss of corporate data in the payment messages. Known fees and complete messages make for much higher auto reconciliation rates.</p>
<p>Unlike some other fintechs, Ripple is bank centric. Banks, rather than their customers, connect to the Ripple network. This has two big benefits. First, customers are used to trusting banks – which is better than having to get comfortable with entrusting your money to some fintech you have never heard of. Second, regulators are comfortable with banks – which means they will not pull the plug on Ripple as they might with non-bank fintechs.</p>
<h3 id="ripple-technology">Ripple technology</h3>
<p>Although Ripple is also a blockchain company, and has its own currency code XRP, the cross-border payments are using a subset of blockchain technology. Ripple uses the consensual validation of encrypted hashes to secure the messages across the Ripple network, but does not hold the ledger. Ripple calls this Inter Ledger Protocol (ILP) and they have open sourced it to public domain.</p>
<p>ILP allows Ripple to connect existing bank ledgers. This lowers barriers to entry. In effect, banks connect their core systems to the Ripple network – analogous to how they currently connect their core systems to the SWIFT network.</p>
<h3 id="ripple-process">Ripple process</h3>
<p>Although it happens within seconds, the Ripple process is holistic, including rich information exchange, liquidity provision and currency conversion. By contrast, the traditional method provides minimal information, liquidity through correspondents, and no conversion (and takes hours or days, and costs more).</p>
<p>Instead of using fixed correspondents, Ripple implements an automated instant auction for liquidity provision and FX, thus assuring best price execution. Banks can restrict their requests for quotation to counterparties matching specific requirements like rating and regulatory standing. KYC and AML compliance is of course covered.</p>
<p>From a corporate treasury perspective, this is analogous to using an eFX platform to get quotes from multiple banks (except that it is purely bank to bank).</p>
<h5>There are four key stages:</h5>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Get quote: the originating bank sends out a request for quotation across the Ripple network for the payment in question. Quotes received in reply include FX rates and fees as well as compliance requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accept quote: the originating bank accepts the best quote for which they can meet the compliance requirements. The beneficiary bank can then lock the quote. At this point Ripple blocks funds in the two banks’ ledgers – something like a sub second escrow arrangement (without transfer of title at this point).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submit sending payment: the originating bank transfers the funds out of the payer’s account and through ILP to the FX or beneficiary bank.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submit receiving payment: the beneficiary bank confirms that funds have been credited to the beneficiary’s account.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The submit receiving payment signifies that funds have been credited to the beneficiary’s account. All of this happens within one or two seconds. As noted above, this is both more holistic and less complicated than the current process, not to mention much faster and cheaper.</p>
<h3 id="gpii">GPII</h3>
<p>In response to the challenge from Ripple, SWIFT have launched their Global Payments Innovation Initiative (GPII). Leveraging the current SWIFT messaging and correspondent banking that are the backbone of old cross-border payments, GPII is basically a set of rules to commit banks to behave more reasonably in cross-border payments, supported by payment tracking and data to monitor adherence to these new rules.</p>
<p>The rules are encapsulated in the service level agreement (SLA) that banks must sign to join GPII. This SLA discourages banks from float (theft of value days), opaque charging and delays.</p>
<p>To support this SLA, SWIFT have built an “observer” system so that partner banks can monitor the SLA compliance of their partners across the system.</p>
<p>To entertain the payment originators, SWIFT have developed a payment tracker, on which the payment’s progress can be viewed in near real time. This will be white labelled by banks for their clients.</p>
<p>The SLA is essentially a commercial challenge for banks. The increased transparency will limit their rent extraction (some banks’ internal processes may be so weak that they genuinely have trouble complying with the SLA, but most corporate cash management banks can do same day reasonably priced cross-border payments when they want to).</p>
<p>The tracker is more of a technical problem. First, some banks may have difficulty tracking payments through their systems at all. Second, it requires the creative use of MT199 free format messages to achieve the requisite updates (trade for corporates similarly uses MT798 free format messages to send L/C related messages). Although it is notionally good old-fashioned SWIFT messaging (MT was designed for telex in the 1970s), implementation is akin to a new system.</p>
<p>SWIFT’s 10,000 bank members would appear to give GPII a big head start, it is far from clear how many banks will end up joining GPII. The take up rate amongst banks for SWIFT for Corporates has been agonisingly slow; ditto for trade.</p>
<h3 id="ripple-vs-gpii">Ripple vs GPII</h3>
<p>It should be clear by now that Ripple offers a faster, cheaper and more complete process. The inclusion of FX gets customers away from the exorbitant “board rates” that banks currently apply for cross-border payments. The auction process will result in better rates and fees for both banks and their customers.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote><p>The good news for treasurers is that whoever prevails (or if they co-exist), cross-border payments will get faster and cheaper – and that is worth celebrating and encouraging.</p></blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source"></p>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>The speed and upfront fees facilitate auto reconciliation and will open up new ways of doing business. It could even eat into credit card flows.</p>
<p>GPII is clearly an improvement on the status quo. Since it is just a SLA with a tracker layered on top of existing correspondent banking arrangements, it does not fundamentally change cross-border payments. There is a risk for banks that sticking to GPII instead of opting for Ripple exposes them to even greater disruption (and possibly complete disintermediation) in the future. At least Ripple is bank centric. Other disruptors may be more aggressive.</p>

<h3 id="caveat-emptor">Caveat emptor</h3>
<p>A word of caution about the current state of cross-border payments. Current generation cross-border payments are too often slow and expensive, as described above. Bank pricing is opaque and often exorbitant. Here are some tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cross-border payments should cost US$5-10 (or less for high volumes).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Percentage fees are unacceptable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So-called “lifting fees” are unacceptable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Correspondent banking fees taken by intermediary banks are unacceptable (your bank has commercial relations with its correspondent that ensure their remuneration; there is no need for additional fees).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Float is theft – the payer account should be debited on the same value date as the beneficiary account is credited; the payment may take time to execute, but there should be no loss of value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Board rates (for FX conversion) can be negotiated, and banks can apply pre-agreed spreads on live market rates when motivated to do so.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have large volumes of low value cross-border payments, ask your bank about cross-border ACH. This is a solution to reduce cross-border payment costs (though it may be slower to execute) whereby the bank arranges a local low value payment in the beneficiary’s country. Some ACH systems cap the maximum value of payments they accept; this may limit their use for large commercial payments.</p>
<h3 id="rationality-vs-incumbency">Rationality vs incumbency</h3>
<p>In a rational world, because it is faster and cheaper and no more difficult to implement, I would expect Ripple to grow faster than GPII. Logically, regulators should prefer Ripple because near instant transfers vastly reduce liquidity and credit risks.</p>
<p>But we do not live in a rational world, and GPII has the benefit of incumbency. Being driven by SWIFT and based on existing correspondent banking arrangements, GPII may seem less frightening to banks.</p>
<p>The good news for treasurers is that whoever prevails (or if they co-exist), cross-border payments will get faster and cheaper – and that is worth celebrating and encouraging.</p></div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>The current popularity of in-house banks (IHB) combined with the regulatory uncertainty surrounding notional pooling makes the case for multicurrency virtual accounts (MCVA) very attractive to a wide range of treasurers.</em></p>
<p>Notional pooling has been a favourite in treasurers’ toolkits for over three decades and primarily provides two key benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Concentrating liquidity across subsidiaries without creating inter-company balances – multi-entity notional pooling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concentrating liquidity across currencies – multicurrency notional pooling.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, most modern notional pools are multi-entity multicurrency notional pools.</p>
<p>These two benefits bring regulatory concerns as Basel III is being worked out in detail. Offsetting balances between different legal entities (eg subsidiaries) has required cross guarantee arrangements in some jurisdictions. Under some interpretations of Basel III, it may not be permitted for regulatory reporting – this would require banks to allocate capital against gross balances, thereby nullifying the economic benefits of notional pooling.</p>
<p>Offsetting balances across currencies is less contentious from a regulatory perspective – it is common practice in financial services and the regulators have established clear guidelines on the haircut (against which regulatory capital must be allocated) required to cover theoretical FX risk (normally based on the VAR of the gross balances).</p>
<p>This means that single entity multicurrency notional pools are on safe regulatory ground. Many IHBs use such pools to manage the IHB’s currency positions and cross currency liquidity.</p>
<h3 id="in-house-bank">In-house bank</h3>
<p>The IHB has become increasingly prevalent over the past decade. For clarity, IHB can sometimes mean setting up a treasury centre; in this article IHB refers to the practice of centralising all flows and balances in the IHB entity which executes all flows on behalf of the operating entities, recording them in an inter-company current account.</p>
<p>IHB is so popular because it removes both flows and balances from the banking system, thereby creating huge cost savings and major risk reductions. Only one account per currency is required for the whole group, payments are aggregated and netted and executed on behalf of subsidiaries by the IHB. Subsidiaries no longer need bank accounts because all flows and balances are handled through their inter-company current account with the IHB.</p>
<p>IHB creates inter-company balances which will attract withholding tax in many jurisdictions as well as thin cap and transfer pricing issues. IHB does not inherently address cross currency exposures, and this is why many IHBs use single entity multicurrency notional pools to manage cross currency liquidity.</p>
<h3 id="virtual-accounts">Virtual accounts</h3>
<p>Virtual accounts have become a standard tool for treasurers seeking to increase auto reconciliation rates. The original idea was to break account numbers into two segments:</p>
<p><img alt="Company and customer graphics" height="145" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/perspectives/opinions/2017-05-06-tta-10-pv-graphic-01-company-and-customer.png?la=en&amp;hash=86DFF6785970080AE504B4EC912CCA95" width="347"/></p>
<p>This ensures that the originator of incoming payments is known, which helps with reconciliation to accounts receivable. Some use the second segment to encode the invoice number, but since this forces customers to change the account number to which they are paying for every invoice (causing operational risk and cost), it is not popular for business to business payments.</p>
<p>A more recent development has been to break account numbers into three segments:</p>
<p><img alt="Group and company and customer graphics" height="148" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/perspectives/opinions/2017-05-06-tta-10-pv-graphic-02-group-and-company-and-customer.png?la=en&amp;hash=9DA1FCCD781A4B556BDB93FB231560A8" width="551"/></p>
<p>This allows multiple subsidiaries to use the same bank account. When used for payments as well as collection, the result is very similar to IHB:</p>
<p><img alt="IHB and subsidiary and customer graphics" height="135" src="https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/perspectives/opinions/2017-05-06-tta-10-pv-graphic-03-ihb-and-subsidary-and-customer.png?la=en&amp;hash=BAA5C1D3290AC822BCFB24B74BE84259" width="551"/></p>
<p>Most IHBs use ERP or TMS systems to manage the process, which can see high volumes of transactions flowing through the IHB’s single bank account per currency. Three segment virtual accounts open the possibility of outsourcing that IT work to banks.</p>
<h3 id="multicurrency-accounts">Multicurrency accounts</h3>
<p>Multicurrency accounts (MCA) have become common in the retail space, and are now starting to be offered to corporates. The main use case is to reduce the cost of FX spreads on FX flows, which can be particularly heavy for smaller corporates who typically get banks’ so called board rates.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote><p>Multicurrency virtual accounts are a valuable addition to treasurers’ solution sets. In addition to their intrinsic benefits they provide a useful path to the benefits of having an in-house bank.</p></blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source"></p>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>When MCAs allow debit balances, they become functionally equivalent to single entity multicurrency notional pools. Treasury would typically run several currency balances and offset them in a base currency to sweep funds to money market funds or other investment products. For example, if investment is in USD:</p>
<figure>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>AUD</th>
<th>EUR</th>
<th>JPY</th>
<th>SGD</th>
<th>USD</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody class="td-right">
<tr>
<td>200.00</td>
<td>300.00</td>
<td>40,000.00</td>
<td>500.00</td>
<td>(1,168.48)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0.75</td>
<td>1.07</td>
<td>115.00</td>
<td>1.43</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</figure>
<p>Sweeping US$1,168.48 to the desired cash investment vehicle makes the net MCA balance across currencies zero, thereby eliminating idle cash.</p>
<h3 id="multicurrency-virtual-accounts">Multicurrency virtual accounts</h3>
<p>By combining three segment virtual accounts with multicurrency accounts, banks have the functional and informational basis to provide IHB as a service to corporates. (Forgive for a moment the irony of outsourcing in-house banking to a bank.)</p>
<p>One remaining challenge will be how to allow corporates to benefit from lowest cost routing (normally avoiding cross border payments in favour of local ACH type payments). Normal IHBs achieve lowest cost routing by locating their currency accounts in the country of the currency, thus having access to local (cheaper) payment instruments; they then provide lowest cost routing to their subsidiaries through the inter-company current account and payments and collections on behalf of the subsidiary. Two workable solutions would be either to use cross border ACH services or to locate a single currency virtual account in country which is swept daily to the MCVA.</p>
<p>This solution may not persuade large corporates with established IHB processes and systems to change, but for corporates who do not have single instance ERPs or a suitable TMS it could provide a cost effective way to access the benefits of IHB.</p>
<p>Banks may fear revenue cannibalisation – basically corporates are doing IHB to reduce costs, which means paying less to banks (as well as to reduce operational risk which has little impact on banks). Since (excepting regulatory costs) treasury is heading inexorably to greater efficiency (driven by competitive pressures), banks will conclude that cannibalising their own revenues is better than letting someone else steal their customers.</p>
<p>Multicurrency virtual accounts are a valuable addition to treasurers’ solution sets. In addition to their intrinsic benefits, MCVAs provide a useful path to the benefits of IHBs. MCVAs will be especially helpful for treasurers who do not have access to the systems required to run IHBs and those whose systems are heterogeneous.</p>

<h5 id="what-have-been-your-biggest-findings-in-the-first-few-months-in-your-new-role-and-what-do-you-want-to-achieve-going-forward">What have been your biggest findings in the first few months in your new role and what do you want to achieve going forward?</h5>
<p>In my new role, I am required to look at the business and the relationships we have with our clients a lot more holistically than I have done previously. This has really opened my eyes to the scale of Citi’s TTS business in EMEA and the many ways that we support our clients across 53 diverse markets in the region. This is very exciting and it has been great to get to know many of our clients across EMEA. The diversity of our own people and the vision they bring to the business is also very exciting.</p>
<p>I see similar diversity with our clients too: the relationships we have are both very deep and very wide, as evidenced by the range of solutions we offer. As a result, when I travel to the different markets and speak to our clients I often find myself not just talking to treasurers, but perhaps procurement heads and other areas of the business. This really highlights how we as a bank support our clients across the full spectrum of their activities. So while it sounds obvious, gaining a clearer view of the breadth of our relationships with our clients has been extremely positive and it makes me very proud that we have such relationships.</p>
<p>What do I want to achieve going forward? I think it is really about taking these relationships to the next level, in an environment where the world is changing at unprecedented speed there are lots of challenges, but also opportunities as well. I want TTS to work with our clients to find solutions that enable them to grow and take advantage of these opportunities.</p>
<h5 id="how-important-is-it-to-have-a-mix-of-talents-within-your-team">How important is it to have a mix of talents within your team?</h5>
<p>It’s very important, especially in the TTS business. We have really strong product capabilities and it is critical to have the minds and skills that maintain the new product development culture. However, we also need the creativity and experiences of individuals to make sure that our solutions perfectly match our clients’ requirements tailoring these solutions appropriately.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We will focus on an ongoing dialogue and collaboration with clients while thinking about the next three to five years. This is about ensuring that our clients are aware that the world is changing and that they need to be prepared for the new technologies that are coming in.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over the last few years we started acquiring a lot of other skills in addition to traditional transaction banking. We all know the importance of technology and it is very interesting to engage people who might have perhaps worked for a fintech or a regulator. So the future is going to look a lot different and the individuals who are going to shape that future probably need to acquire new skills and to change themselves too. That change has already begun.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-the-key-priorities-of-treasurers-in-the-region?--have-these-priorities-shifted-at-all-in-recent-years">What are the key priorities of treasurers in the region? Have these priorities shifted at all in recent years?</h5>
<p>There is a lot of geopolitical uncertainty, from the implications of Brexit for both the UK and Europe to upcoming elections in the EU. Combined with the new administration in the US, this is an environment where surprises are becoming commonplace. I think this really is driving the priorities for treasurers right now – but how should they prepare for the unexpected?</p>
<p>I think flexibility is key in this environment. Treasurers need to stay agile in terms of managing liquidity and currency risk. They also need flexibility in order to manage working capital and cash flow in an environment in which their business partners, sales partners, marketing and procurement partners may have potentially conflicting priorities. Treasurers need to react to new M&amp;A opportunities pursued by their companies too, so I think the name of the game is to retain that flexibility.</p>
<p>If I have to summarise, I would say there are probably six areas of focus:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Adapting to changes in the regulations especially tax regulations such as BEPS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Risk management, including financial as well as operational and emerging risks with use of new technologies, hedging strategies and the risk of fraud in its many guises.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liquidity planning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The need to maintain a close eye on the overall working capital of the company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New technology in the short, medium and longer term.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developing and nurturing talent for today as well as tomorrow and really thinking about the individuals who will be driving their businesses in the future. This is a long-term investment but one that will ultimately drive future success.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When I speak to treasurers, it is clear that managing all these competing priorities and challenges – and getting the resources needed to do this – is a huge task for them. Nowadays treasurers have so many day-to-day pressures that getting the fundamentals of the job done whilst also being strategic is a considerable challenge.</p>
<h5 id="how-is-citi-supporting-its-clients-in-the-region-in-light-of-these-changing-priorities">How is Citi supporting its clients in the region in light of these changing priorities?</h5>
<p>I would break this into a few key work efforts. One of them is our investment in advisory services. This has enabled us to work with multinationals using tools, techniques and big data so that our clients can benchmark their treasuries and address the question “what does best practice look like?”</p>
<p>This has been very important for us and we continue this advisory dialogue in areas such as changes to tax regulation, supply chains, account structures, legal entities, double-taxation treaties and much more – it’s a complete treasury advisory service which is evolving all the time and is a key differentiator for us. Brexit has also put this advisory offering in the spotlight again and many of our clients are turning to us and asking about the different scenarios and what they might mean for their business.</p>
<p>This advisory then feeds into our product development, especially around the innovation that we are doing in our labs. We make sure that when we develop new projects, we work with our clients to understand what they need, rather than what we think they need.</p>
<p>Our final focus is on building awareness regarding topics such as cyber-security – this is a big area of focus for all our clients. For the past year, we have hosted a lot of awareness and training sessions with our own cyber-security and information security experts, the objective being to make sure our clients are fully aware of the risks and the techniques and strategies to mitigate these.</p>
<h5 id="what-makes-citi-a-bank-that-corporates-in-emea-should-work-with">What makes Citi a bank that corporates in EMEA should work with?</h5>
<p>We have talked about the advisory and partnership role the bank fulfils, but I have not mentioned what makes Citi unique in being able to fulfil this role: our global network. This network brings local know-how, experience and natural diversity to our engagement with clients.</p>
<p>I think another important aspect to this is about being progressive. This doesn’t always mean coming up with an entirely new product, but it does mean thinking about the new technologies which are out there and being willing to explore things that are of interest to our clients. I think the extent to which an institution engages in progressive thinking is very important. This is where I see a lot of drive and energy in our business; it makes me proud to work with people who are coming up with these great solutions and packaging them in a way that makes life easy for our clients.</p>
<p>I think that putting these different elements together to see what actually works for a client, rather than just putting it down together and saying “here is a solution, it might work for you,” takes a certain creative mindset. It is about working with clients to lift the bonnet of their business, understand the mechanics and deliver the right solutions.</p>
<h5 id="broadly-speaking-is-everybody-looking-to-adopt-technology-to-make-their-lives-easier">Broadly speaking, is everybody looking to adopt technology to make their lives easier?</h5>
<p>At the end of the day, the industries our clients are in determine the pace at which they are looking at new technology. Most are investing in technology which makes treasury more efficient and better controlled, such as improving data integration, leveraging industry standard file formats and adopting virtual account structures and auto-reconciliation tools.</p>
<p>As you start building on that, there are other tools which are developing in the industry such as SWIFT’s global payments initiative (gpi) in the cross-border payments space, which is bringing more transparency and information about the status of payments.</p>
<p>Another area is real-time payment infrastructures. Companies which receive payments from a lot of different consumers and which have developed ecommerce or online sales platforms may be looking at adopting real-time collection methods. This opens up a whole new universe of mobile payments, wallets and so on. So a company’s customers and supply chain will determine the next set of tools that they want to leverage.</p>
<p>Then there is more game-changing use of technology that can fundamentally change business and operating models for companies in different industries and change how corporate treasuries need banking and financial services. The auto sector is one example of how companies are really pushing the boundaries of technology. Some companies are developing ‘connected’ vehicle strategies and digitising their business models to open up their cars to internet of things (IoT) features, such as enabling consumers to buy groceries while they are driving home. This, of course, presents an entirely new challenge for treasurers who are being asked to figure out how to handle such transactions.</p>
<p>So I think there is a very different world developing out there. Again, I see this as a co-creation journey with our clients as they think about these new business models, and as we think about what this means for the services we can help them with.</p>
<h5 id="looking-to-the-next-12-months-what-do-you-see-as-the-major-areas-of-focus-for-treasurers-and-how-are-you-going-to-make-sure-citis-plans-align-with-these">Looking to the next 12 months, what do you see as the major areas of focus for treasurers and how are you going to make sure Citi’s plans align with these?</h5>
<p>I would say we will be focusing on three broad areas.</p>
<p>The first is business as usual – the client experience and making it as efficient and effective as we possibly can across the various touch points we have with our clients. This is an obvious step, but given the breadth of the relationship that we have with our clients and the number of touch points that exist, this is very important.</p>
<p>Second is a focus on the next 12-24 months as Brexit unfolds, acknowledging other major market changes that we may need to react to and any immediate impact on our customers’ supply chains. This could lead to supply chain finance, sales financing, more effective hedging and liquidity structures – and, importantly, listening to our clients as they navigate this uncertain time.</p>
<p>Finally, we will focus on an ongoing dialogue and collaboration with clients while thinking about the next three to five years. This is about ensuring that our clients are aware that the world is changing and that they need to be prepared for the new technologies that are coming in. This is crucial if we are to continue to serve our clients as trusted advisors and develop the right strategies with them going forward.</p>
<p>I am keen to ensure we don’t take our eyes off that future horizon while doing what we need to do in the short term.</p></div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>The current arrangements for storing and transferring value evolved over centuries under organisational, legal and technical constraints that are now mostly irrelevant. Rather than delegating account holding and payments to banks, central banks should bank us all directly.</em></p>
<p>We take money for granted, but through most of history, exchange was based on the (perceived) intrinsic value of things like sea shells and coins. The origins of paper money date back to the 14<sup>th</sup> century bills of exchange of Venetian merchants and the drafts of the piaohao in China.</p>
<p>In 19<sup>th</sup> century USA, there were more than 5,000 different types of bank notes issued by various commercial banks, and it was only in 1913 that the Federal Reserve Bank was granted exclusive rights to issue notes and coins.</p>
<p>Even after issuance was centralised, money was still based on central bank gold holdings through the end of the Bretton Woods agreement in 1971. Since then we have had pure fiat money, ie the currency is worth something because the government says so and because we all believe it.</p>
<p>Modern banking evolved at a time when there were no computers and no telecommunications. It was impossible for central banks to deal directly with people and institutions across the country. So, central banks used commercial banks as intermediates to reach their markets.</p>
<h3 id="bank-accounts">Bank accounts</h3>
<p>Modern bank accounts are a claim by the account holder on money at the central bank. Simplistically, the bank is a large netting operation whose net balance is their account with the central bank. All money (other than bitcoin and its ilk) is fiat money issued by central banks. So money in your bank account is a claim on fiat money at the central bank.</p>
<p>Likewise, modern payment systems are bank intermediated transfers of central bank money. Payments are backed by transfers from the paying bank’s account at the central bank to the beneficiary bank’s account at the central bank – either directly or by net settlement.</p>
<p>Bank intermediation of central bank money imposes massive costs on society. Although the central bank by definition cannot run out of money, individual commercial banks can. Banks exploit their monopoly position to extract rents from the real economy, and take risks for profit. To mitigate the systemic risks caused by bank intermediation, governments regulate the banks, adding further costs on society.</p>
<h3 id="central-bank-accounts-for-all">Central bank accounts for all</h3>
<p>Now that we have the technological resources to eliminate bank intermediation of central bank money, it makes sense to end this costly and risky arrangement.</p>
<p>When we all have our accounts directly with the central bank, we eliminate all of the liquidity risks in payment systems. The system requirements are trivial compared to what is being done in ‘tech land’. Scale economies – one central bank system vs hundreds of banks reinventing the payment wheel – will result in further gains for society. Whatever it costs to implement and run, the system would be paid for ten times over by savings in regulation alone.</p>
<h3 id="banks-still-needed">Banks still needed</h3>
<p>Eliminating bank intermediation of money by allowing everyone to have central bank accounts directly does not mean the end of banking. Store and transfer of money is a natural government monopoly, and will be provided as a government utility for all. Cleaning up this basic service will open space for banks (and others) to provide the myriad financial services required in modern economies.</p>
<p>Banks (and others) will still be required for investment and lending services, for foreign exchange and cross border remittances, for a host of value added services required by individuals and institutions. Since all money will be at the central bank directly, these services can be provided at much lower risk and cost.</p>
<p>Banks will benefit from getting out of their role in account holding and payments. They complain incessantly that they make no money from payments, so presumably they will welcome being relieved of this burden. Account balances were nice in the days of decent net interest margins (NIMs) but those days are long past and unlikely to return any time soon.</p>
<h3 id="liquidity">Liquidity</h3>
<p>Eliminating bank intermediation of money will drastically reduce many systemic risks that plague current arrangements. We will all have accounts with our central bank. Since central banks are the ultimate holder (and creator) of fiat money, there cannot be a run on a central bank – they simply cannot run out of money. We can still lose value to inflationary devaluation, but that risk is the same in the current arrangements.</p>
<p>Without banks intermediating payments, there will be no liquidity risk in payments. Banks will still have plenty of risk around credit, duration and banks will continue to pose liquidity risk from a balance sheet perspective.</p>
<p>Central banks will go with real time settlement because without bank intermediation there is no need for all the complex and risk creating settlement arrangements we currently have. For instance, when Alice pays Bob, her account will be debited and his account credited in the same transaction – no more waiting for payments to wind their way through complex interbank systems, and no more intermediary credit risk.</p>
<h3 id="investment-banking">Investment banking</h3>
<p>I assume central banks will not want to get into the business of providing investment service and loans. It is probably better that they focus on basic store and transfer services to keep things simple. For instance, if the government wants to encourage people to invest in treasury bonds, it will be better if that service is provided by treasury rather than by the central bank.</p>
<p>We will still need banks (and others) to provide such services, and hopefully to manage the risks. Thus, money can be swept from people’s central bank account to bank deposits or MMFs and so forth. People might even elect to keep all their money at banks (under mandate) to maximise yield or benefit from, for example, offset mortgage arrangements – whereby the bank charges mortgage interest on the net of the mortgage and any available cash.</p>
<p>Fractional reserve banking and bank creation of money by lending will continue with few regulatory adjustments, since it is only the store and transfer of money that will change.</p>
<h3 id="notes-and-coins">Notes and coins</h3>
<p>The elimination of bank intermediation of money will provide a perfect opportunity to get rid of notes and coins altogether. If this is not deemed desirable, current ATM networks can continue to provide their services.</p>
<p>Either the banks sell their ATMs to the central bank for it to run as a service, or banks provide ATMs as a value-added service for those who want notes and coins using mandate arrangements to transfer money from their customer’s central bank account to their own.</p>
<p>Current ATM networks are interoperable between banks, and this would be similar – except there would no longer be any need to settle through archaic systems like ACH.</p>
<h3 id="cross-border-payments">Cross-border payments</h3>
<p>Assuming that central banks will not interoperate, cross-border payments and FX will be a value-added service provided by banks (and others). In this context, Ripple could provide a very interesting service.</p>
<h3 id="mandates">Mandates</h3>
<p>Mandate arrangements will be required to enable value added services from banks (and others). This is akin to current arrangements for direct debit and investment services, so nothing new here. The key factor is that the service provider is operating your account at the central bank under mandate or power of attorney, so all the benefits of liquidity management and risk reduction remain intact.</p>
<h3 id="aml-and-kyc">AML and KYC</h3>
<p>Compliance will be radically simplified. Banks will no longer risk massive fines for compliance lapses, and regulators will no longer have to worry about bank box ticking – because the central bank will do the compliance itself.</p>
<p>One can imagine that accounts will be created at birth for individuals and upon incorporation for institutions. Once the base account exists, adding extra accounts within the established identity will not require extra checking.</p>
<h3 id="privacy">Privacy</h3>
<p>Some people may be concerned that this sounds too much like big brother watching us all. Governance issues must be addressed. We already have lots of precedent for Chinese walls between different government functions that can be applied to our central bank accounts if so desired.</p>
<p>In any case, banking secrecy has long ago disappeared in this world of AML, KYC, BEPS, etc. Whether the tax authorities or other government departments have to subpoena a bank or the central bank to see your account does not make a big difference.</p>
<h3 id="technology">Technology</h3>
<p>It may seem technologically daunting for a central bank to provide accounts for all individuals and institutions. There is plenty of precedent for large scale systems that are much more complex – medical records, for example. Store and transfer of money is very simple – the balance is a running total and transfers debit the paying account and credit the beneficiary account.</p>
<p>The scale will be large, so some kind of distributed and modularised system is likely required. It might be a use case for blockchain but I do not think the specific database technology is a primary concern.</p>
<h3 id="the-future-is-now">The future is now</h3>
<p>The current arrangement for store and transfer of money is an anachronism that brings high costs and massive risks as well as monopolistic rent extraction to the detriment of the real economy. It is time to do away with bank intermediation of money and let us all open accounts at the central bank directly.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>Several conferences in 2016 have persuaded me that most treasurers (and most bankers) do not really understand distributed ledgers such as blockchain and their implications for the profession. Here I take a closer look at the key attributes of distributed ledgers and put these into perspective.</em></p>
<p>Blockchain has been associated with bitcoin, which in turn has been associated with many scandals. Fintech has, therefore, moved to the more neutral term ‘distributed ledger’. But this term doesn’t mean much – treasury management systems and general ledgers are normally distributed for resilience purposes. I prefer the term ‘mutual distributed ledger (MDL)’, which conveys the multi-owner aspect of the technology.</p>
<h3 id="how-it-works">How it works</h3>
<p>MDLs are composed of chains of data blocks containing records of some kind. Whenever a new block is added to the chain, a hash (an encrypted checksum that is unique to the underlying data) is added to the top of the chain, effectively “locking” the chain (any change in the records in any block would result in a different hash, making any tampering evident).</p>
<p>The records within each block can be encrypted so that only their owners can see the details. This means the network of nodes does not have to see the data within each record – it merely certifies through consensus on the hash what is stored in each block. This is why MDLs are used for medical records, KYC, and other sensitive information.</p>
<p>Every node (or server) in the MDL network has a full copy of the entire chain, and all the nodes must agree on the hash before a new block becomes part of the chain.</p>
<p>In summary, MDLs have four key attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Ledger:</h5>
<p>MDL is composed of blocks of records.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Distributed:</h5>
<p>MDL is distributed across many nodes or servers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Mutual:</h5>
<p>MDL is spread across multiple entities and relies on consensus to validate the hashes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Immutable:</h5>
<p>MDL blocks are secured by the hashes that are cumulative including the latest block and all previous blocks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s then take a look at these attributes in more detail and put them into perspective.</p>
<h4 id="ledger">Ledger</h4>
<p>Ledgers have existed for millennia. First sticks then clay tablets, then paper in its various forms, then punched cards, and now bits and bytes in different forms.</p>
<p>Ledgers are generally composed of records – such as journal entries in an accounting general ledger. They are commonly used to record transactions such as money flows or purchases and sales, and to record assets such as real estate, trade, and financial asset ownership. They can also be used to record data such as legal and individual documents (for KYC), medical records, institution membership, and so on.</p>
<p>In MDLs, the ledger is composed of blocks of records, which are analogous to pages of a paper ledger, arranged in a chain, which is analogous to the binding that holds the individual pages together in a paper ledger book.</p>
<p>Current generation ledgers are typically held on SQL databases, though other forms of database are used in different circumstances.</p>
<h4 id="distributed">Distributed</h4>
<p>MDLs are normally highly distributed. The bitcoin blockchain, for instance, runs on thousands of otherwise unrelated servers operated by “miners” who are paid for their efforts in bitcoins. Commercial MDLs tend to be run across a smaller group of interested parties – banks for payments, brokers for securities, etc.</p>
<p>Being distributed increases the resilience of the MDL. Since all nodes have a full copy of the MDL, when any node goes down the MDL continues to function.</p>
<p>This insight is not new to MDLs. Most SQL databases offer clustering, whereby the database is replicated across multiple servers in different locations. Apache – the open source organisation that drives most web servers – offers at least three distributed database solutions: Cassandra for NoSQL, CouchDB for JSON and Hadoop for big data.</p>
<p>Distributed databases are not just for cloud and the web. Most corporate ERPs and TMSs will have distributed databases in at least two locations to ensure sustainability.</p>
<h4 id="mutual">Mutual</h4>
<p>MDLs are typically shared across a number of participants. The industry talks about permissioned and permissionless MDLs. The bitcoin blockchain is permissionless – anyone can participate and no-one controls onboarding.</p>
<p>In fact, the bitcoin blockchain also provides an example of an ownerless MDL. Satoshi Nakamoto – whoever they are – wrote the original paper describing the bitcoin blockchain and has since left it to live its own life. Governance is purely baked into the algorithms themselves.</p>
<p>Permissioned MDLs have some kind of mutual or individual gatekeeper, so it’s more like a private club. This is the kind of MDL envisioned by most banks and regulators. MDLs can also be private.</p>
<p>MDLs enable a kind of technical mutuality that is different from what can be achieved with traditional databases. But there are plenty of examples of shared data systems. Wikipedia is a huge example. SWIFT is a major example in finance. Most clearing systems are mutually owned by banks and/or government. But it is true that they all required human old school governance.</p>
<h4 id="immutable">Immutable</h4>
<p>Absent tricks like disappearing ink, the old paper ledgers were immutable. Think of shivering Bob Cratchit transcribing entries into Scrooge’s ledger. Any mistakes have to be corrected with a reversal and new entry.</p>
<p>We have carried the same principal into our digital ledgers. For example, auditors routinely perform tests to ensure that general ledger entries cannot be tampered with after posting. This is routine with current accounting systems using old school SQL databases.</p>
<p>So ‘immutable’ is also not unique to MDLs.</p>
<p>What MDLs do change is the governance model. To trust an SQL database, you need to trust the governance of that database. Intrinsically, an SQL database is mutable using SQL’s “UPDATE” and “DELETE” statements. We need to have digital and human controls in place to ensure that general ledger entries are not changed after posting. For our own general ledger, we trust our internal controls. For external ledgers like a bank account, we trust the service provider’s control and verify with reconciliation.</p>
<p>The MDL governance model is different. In an MDL we trust the hashing of the blocks, cryptography, and the consensus mechanism. This tech governance is probably as good or better than traditional controls. What is significant is that we trust the technology rather than the institution. This can be a very powerful shift.</p>
<h3 id="some-considerations">Some considerations</h3>
<p>When considering financial technology, it is important to remember that there are many issues beyond technology per se at play. Capital and liquidity will always be critical – for example, instant payments reduce or eliminate counterparty and also bring possible liquidity issues (period net settlement in central bank money has the benefit of reducing liquidity tied up in payments).</p>
<p>Regulations will affect fintech feasibility. This is why progressive central banks like BoE and MAS have created regulatory sandboxes for fintech experimentation. While MDLs have the potential to greatly smooth KYC, regulators will still want money flows to be controlled for fraud, AML and KYC.</p>
<p>In the end, humans have to trust the new systems if they are going to use them. Treasurers are for good reason very conservative. Current low tech, for all its frustrations, basically works (albeit slowly and expensively) and the problems are well known and generally mitigated. New tech may bring new risks – is it really secure, will it be sustainable, will there be liquidity in tight times?</p>
<p>These issues are not insurmountable, but we need to remember that non-tech issues may be critical to success. A good example is Ripple which has 45 banks doing sub-second cross-border payments; Ripple has addressed many of these problems by working with and through banks (and hiring experienced bankers).</p>
<h3 id="looking-to-the-future">Looking to the future</h3>
<p>MDLs clearly offer many potential benefits. They will likely become very important in finance, and maybe even a key part of the internet itself. However, MDLs are not the only technology that provides those four key features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Ledger:</h5>
<p>There are many database technologies that work fine as ledgers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Distributed:</h5>
<p>Most current databases are distributed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Mutual:</h5>
<p>Mutual systems are prevalent throughout finance and work reasonably well and are well understood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Immutable:</h5>
<p>We have long experience with reliably locking down ledgers in current database technology.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>MDLs per se and from a strictly technological perspective will not necessarily upend the treasurer’s world. However, the threat of MDLs (and even the fashion for MDLs) will likely prompt banks et al to push forward with things they should have done years ago, like trade and KYC registries and fast, cheap, transparent cross-border payments. But for treasurers, it does not really matter whether they do it with MDLs or SQL or NoSQL.</p></div>

<p>Mark Evans is the Managing Director, Transaction Banking, at ANZ. He is responsible for end-to-end transaction banking services – including payments, cash management, trade finance and supply chain finance solutions – across ANZ’s home markets of Australia and New Zealand and the bank’s footprint globally.</p>
<p>Mark joined ANZ in July 2009 as the Global Head of Trade and Supply Chain, responsible for managing and growing the Group’s international trade finance related activities. Prior to his current appointment in June 2016, Mark was ANZ’s Chief Compliance Officer from 2013, developing and implementing a global compliance framework and ensuring high compliance standards in all the jurisdictions in which ANZ operates. Before ANZ, Mark spent five years at HSBC, initially as Head of Trade and Supply Chain for Australia and New Zealand based in Sydney and then three years in Hong Kong where he was responsible for the Trade and Supply Chain business across Asia Pacific.</p>

<div class="copy__body"><h4>What makes transaction banking and ANZ’s business in Asia Pacific a vital part of the bank’s ongoing strategy?</h4>
<p>Asia Pacific remains a critical part of our strategy because that’s where our customers want to do business. The region is vital to the future of our customers in our home markets: Australia and New Zealand export about US$165bn to Asia and import about US$125bn from Asia every year. And by 2050 Asia will account for 50% of global GDP so it goes without saying the region is vital to our future plans.</p>
<p>Our presence in Asia Pacific remains a differentiator for us, especially compared to the other Australasian banks. And when compared to Asian banks, we have an unrivalled connection back to our home markets of Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Within transaction banking specifically, we have seen major changes in the competitive landscape in recent years, with banks adapting and refining their strategies. Indeed, all banks have had to seriously consider whether they are committed to this business, especially as regulatory and compliance costs have increased.</p>
<p id="anz-video-interview">We have decided that Transaction Banking, which sits within the Institutional division at ANZ, is a business that we are committed to and an area of the bank that is key going forward. The recent consolidation in some areas of the bank, such as the sale of our retail and wealth business in Singapore, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and Indonesia to DBS, has initially no impact on our Institutional and Transaction Banking customers. We are very much open for business and committed to transaction banking in the region.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4>In what areas, in particular, does the bank have strength and what differentiates ANZ from its competitors?</h4>
<p>Like all banks in this capital-constrained environment, we had to make tough decisions and be clear on where our strengths are. We have gone through a period of adjustment and are confident in our strengths and where we can best serve our customers.</p>
<p>Ultimately, transaction banking remains a relationship business and it is underpinned by trust. In fact, the whole financial system is effectively built on trust. We build our relationships and gain trust by being responsive to our customers, and having the knowledge and expertise to advise them appropriately. Trust and relationship are most critically tested during a crisis. Through the recent financial uncertainties and market turmoils we have demonstrated to our customers that we can be relied on when it really matters and can respond swiftly and effectively.</p>
<p>Focusing on forging trusted relationships has proved successful and in 2015 we maintained our top four Corporate Bank in Asia ranking in the Greenwich Associates Asian Large Corporate Banking Study, a rank we have held for the last four years. We also ranked first for relationship quality and achieved the top spot for overall service for the first time. Our relationship manager quality outperformed our rivals, and I believe we did this because we focus on the solutions rather than simply selling products to our customers.</p>
<p>Also, as previously mentioned, our geographical network – connecting Australia and New Zealand to Asia and the Pacific – is a major differentiator. We have experts on the ground in 15 Asian markets who can provide invaluable insights. We are well versed in the complexities of the markets and can advise customers how best to structure transactions to mitigate risk and ensure a successful outcome for all parties.</p>
<p>For instance, in the Mekong, if you are operating in countries like Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand or Vietnam, it can be difficult to navigate the local nuances and regulations. And when it comes to avoiding exposure to financial crime, such as money laundering or terrorist financing, you need to have a banking partner you can rely on that operates to international standards.</p>
<p>In addition, we are especially strong and able to provide leading industry insights in sectors such as natural resources, agricultural business, infrastructure, financial institutions, and, in our home markets, property.</p>
<h4>What plans do you have to build on these strengths and offer further value to your clients?</h4>
<p>In terms of our product capability, we have always been known as a strong trade bank – trade is in our DNA. In recent years we have been steadily building our cash capabilities so we can now be known as a strong bank both for Trade and Cash. That is why we are investing so that customers can access the bank at a single point and seamlessly pick and choose the solutions they need regardless of what product set they fall into.</p>
<p>This is part of our significant investment in our digital capabilities. This will result in an improved customer experience, a consistent look and feel no matter what products or services our customers use or where in the world they choose to transact.</p>
<h4>How does digitisation fit into the bank’s strategy and what areas, in particular, does ANZ believe that innovative technology can benefit its clients?</h4>
<p>Digital is a core part of the bank’s overall strategy and the initiative is coming from the top, from our CEO Shayne Elliott, who outlined it as a key pillar when he began his new role in early 2016. Maile Carnegie, Group Executive – Digital Banking, joined ANZ in July 2016 from Google and has been challenging how we think about digitisation. The digital agenda is at the heart of our transformation and something every corner of the bank is working on.</p>
<p>In terms of trials that we can talk about publicly, we had a successful proof of concept using distributed ledger technology in cross-border payments. Although it is early days, we believe this kind of technology will play an important role in improving efficiency, transparency and security for our customers. Trade finance is another area where we are exploring the use of various new technologies to achieve better outcomes for industry participants.</p>
<p>Last November, we opened an innovation lab in Singapore called ANZ BlueSpace. The facility is dedicated to innovation for institutional clients, and it has been set up as a place for us to collaborate with partners – including participants from industry, academia and government – who are also part of the fintech ecosystem.</p>
<h4>Is collaboration the way forward when it comes to developing solutions and new ways of doing things that can benefit the industry as a whole?</h4>
<p>I think it is important to acknowledge that no one can do everything alone, and no organisation can innovate in a vacuum. This was demonstrated when we held the ANZ-NUS Financial Services Innovation Challenge in September. The event challenged students from the National University of Singapore to apply technologies such as blockchain, data analytics and APIs to solve the inefficiencies in trade finance.</p>
<p>IBM, Thomson Reuters and GitHub were supporting partners of the event, with EY, UN Women and DXMarkets providing mentoring and coaching to the students.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>We, along with our partners, were able to educate the students about the real-world problems of trade finance, and IBM, for example, introduced them to the tools available in their apps and services platform Bluemix. This event demonstrated collaboration in action and was a vibrant meeting place for the various partners to put their minds together. The solutions the students came up with were impressive, and the quality of their work was outstanding. Many honed in on ways to use blockchain to reduce fraud in trade finance, something that we are also looking at. We believe it is important to include students in our thinking – they, after all, are our future. We are currently exploring with the students how we can develop the solutions they came up with.</p>
<p>With the distributed ledger proof of concept I mentioned, we saw some very tangible results in how the technology can be used for cross-border payments to address the inefficiencies in the correspondent banking system.</p>
<h4>Looking to the next 12 months and beyond, what do you believe will be the mega-trends that shape the region and what impact might these have on treasury professionals here in the region?</h4>
<p>I would anticipate that political instability will be a major issue in the next 12 months. We’ve seen some unexpected outcomes in recent months like Brexit, the election of Donald Trump, and the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye in South Korea. What we have learned is that predictions can easily be proved incorrect and that we should come to expect uncertainty. These kinds of events will likely continue in 2017, which could impact treasurers in terms of the value of the US dollar and the need to hedge their strategies effectively.</p>
<p>I expect there will be a continuing focus on compliance, particularly in the context of financial crime, capital and liquidity so banks and customers need to be aware and work together on embedding compliance into their business as usual.</p>
<p>Also, emerging technologies will continue to be a trend. Banks and corporates will need to be alert and agile so they can maximise the opportunities of the latest technologies while also managing increasing cyber-security risks.</p>
<h4>You have mentioned cyber security and the risk of fraud. This is something our readers show a lot of interest in. How does ANZ help its clients to mitigate such risks?</h4>
<p>Cyber criminals are becoming more sophisticated and cyber security is something our customers are increasingly asking us about. Previously cybercrime used to be a discussion for the largest corporates, and for chief technology officers or chief information and security officers, but in this digital age it is everybody’s problem. In an organisation, it is everybody’s responsibility to prevent it. Humans are the weak link – usually a cyber-attack happens because someone somewhere in the organisation did something they shouldn’t have.</p>
<p>Awareness is the first step in mitigating these risks. We embarked on a client education program, and have hosted a number of events for our customers where they heard from experts in the field and were in an environment where they felt comfortable asking any questions.</p>
<p>The issue of cybercrime can be overwhelming for corporates. Although mitigating the risks effectively requires significant investment, there are still some simple steps corporates can take to improve their people, systems, and processes. Internally, corporates first need to understand their exposures, educate themselves about the risks of cybercrime, and have a response process in place. Externally, they can leverage experts, look to best practices, and share and seek intelligence.</p>
<p>We are all stronger if we – our customers, financial institutions and other stakeholders – fight cybercrime together. It is a rising threat, but it is also a natural consequence of all organisations adopting new technologies. Cyber-security goes hand in hand with becoming a digital organisation, and we have been proud to share our knowledge on the topic with our clients.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>I had the pleasure of chairing at three conferences in the last month – ACTS/ATC in Singapore, SIBOS in Geneva and EuroFinance in Vienna. When I look through my notes, my head spins. My only conclusion is that we are at a confusing point. Here are some observations.</em></p>
<h3 id="regulatory-tsunami">Regulatory tsunami</h3>
<p>A major theme at the recent EuroFinance conference in Vienna was exponentiation – change has become exponential in line with Moore’s law. Feeding on exponentiation (and the murky mistakes of our simpler past), we have exponential growth of regulation. One source cited 400 new regulations per day affecting global banks. The regulations get more complicated so we need more complex systems and processes to work within and around them, then the regulators combat complexity with more complex regulations … hard to see a happy ending.</p>
<p>And from what the experts say we are barely in the warm up phase! “We are drowning in basics” set the tone for the corporate panel at SIBOS. No tech hype, no market gee-whiz, all we want is visibility and standards.</p>
<h3 id="swift-for-corporates-since-1996">SWIFT for Corporates since 1996</h3>
<p>At the same conference SWIFT for Corporates celebrated being 20-years old. So, treasurers who still think SWIFT is some new-fangled bleeding edge solution might need a re-think. SWIFT itself is 43 years old.</p>
<p>SWIFT’s target is to double corporate membership to 3,000 by 2020. On the one hand that sounds suitably exponential. On the other hand, it should be more like 30,000 corporates. This would make sense for all players. Banks created this utility (SWIFT) in 1973 to reduce costs and risks, and it has served them well; now they need to use it to save costs and risks in corporate connectivity. Corporates complain about lack of transparency and standardisation; SWIFT is the ideal solution.</p>
<p>SWIFT is also progressing its Global Payments Initiative (GPII) which addresses concerns about transparency and visibility by guaranteeing same day crediting of funds, up-front fee visibility, and payment tracking through the correspondent network. GPII has the advantage of leveraging the incumbent solution; rivals such as Ripple aim to bring these benefits with a clean slate.</p>
<p>At least at the moment. Plenty of fintech and bank owned challengers are working on new payment technology and maybe blockchain in some of its variants will take over the financial world (that is probably a subject for another article).</p>
<p>I had assumed that all central banks are revving up on blockchain, but I learned that only the Bank of England and the Monetary Authority of Singapore have specific fintech teams. Both countries are also front runners in implementing regulatory sandboxes for fintech.</p>
<h3 id="kyc">KYC</h3>
<p>We seem to be no closer to solving the KYC mess, and in fact the problem is getting worse. Corporates complain – banks ask for much more information than they need, each bank (and sometimes branch and/or department) dreams up its own requirements, it can take a year to change signatories, “you cannot automate a broken process”.</p>
<p>Banks don’t like unhappy customers but are terrified of massive fines if they don’t comply with regulators’ nebulous demands. Regulators want to avoid KYC becoming a box ticking exercise, so they leave the details to banks – which means banks dream up their own boxes to tick.</p>
<p>KYC is of course necessary, but there has to be a smarter way. Currently we are imposing a huge burden on the real economy, wrapping legitimate businesses in red tape, and barely affecting the criminals and terrorists.</p>
<p>Singapore is showing pragmatism in building a multi-bank KYC platform. Hopefully, they will align and share their solution with other countries.</p>
<h3 id="trade">Trade</h3>
<p>I had an interesting experience at SIBOS when I innocently asked what is the capital weighting for letters of credits. After all, SIBOS is an assembly of 10,000 transaction banking experts, so they ought to know – right? Wrong! A really helpful board member finally provided me with the correct answer – which is first “it is not clear yet” and second “it depends”.</p>
<p>Trade remains profitable for banks despite being paper bound. Trade is way behind its digital potential even though there are several working solutions.</p>
<p>Being a big trade hub, and needing to do more with less, Singapore has also launched a blockchain based trade solution to speed the paperwork around all those containers. Singapore processes the physical containers within twelve hours. It makes no sense for the paperwork to take days or weeks.</p>
<h3 id="fintech-and-regtech">Fintech and regtech</h3>
<p>Fintech is maturing. The technologies are better understood (although there remains a lot of confusion about blockchain, resulting in some hilarious panels). It is becoming clear that non-tech factors like liquidity, regulations and humans will determine the success or failure of fintech efforts.</p>
<p>Given the regulatory tsunami I mentioned above, it will come as no surprise (in hindsight) that regtech is the new buzzword.</p>
<p>I am not sure that more tech to deal with more regulation is such a great idea in the long term, but it fills a need in the current mess.</p>
<p>It was interesting to learn that distributed ledgers are not new – they have been around for 25 years – and they are in use already in industries like insurance and government.</p>
<p>Recognising that improvement will take more than tech, it is interesting to see the advance of API banking. For example, many of the new clearing systems being rolled out around the world have open APIs that are intended at least in part to allow non-bank players to enter the payments market. This might be more significant than all the pure tech hype.</p>
<p>Some banks are re-branding themselves as tech companies. Some are saying they have always been tech companies. Real tech companies say the whole world is going digital, so maybe the issue is moot. Certainly, finance is more amenable to digitisation than physical goods (in fact money is just information beefed up by varying degrees of credulity). UBS’ Sergio Ermotti said his bank is just a bank that is a heavy user of technology – which seems about right.</p>
<h3 id="cybersecurity">Cybersecurity</h3>
<p>If exponentiation was the dominant theme of EuroFinance, then cybersecurity was the dominant theme of SIBOS. The now infamous Bank of Bangladesh incident got everyone’s attention. Just to clarify, SWIFT itself was not hacked. Bank of Bangladesh was hacked. And, although the hackers gained access to Bank of Bangladesh’s servers (inter alia to spoof some reports so that reconciliation would not trigger alarms), the critical hack was social hacking to users’ credentials.</p>
<p>Needless to say, SWIFT is vigorously sharing the learnings and best practices to beef up security amongst its members.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting views I heard was that “you will be hacked, in fact you are probably being hacked right now”, so cybersecurity has to be more like building an immune system than (fire) walls. It’s about resilience not impregnability.</p>
<p>Of course, technical security has to be in place and up to date. That is generally an IT responsibility. The CEO has to own cyber-resilience – training and awareness for all staff, cyber response plans, cyber drills, and so on. When business goes digital, cybersecurity becomes everyone’s responsibility.</p>
<h3 id="resilience">Resilience</h3>
<p>Interestingly, both keynote speakers at EuroFinance were asked what they feared most. The first answered cybersecurity. The second answered pandemics. For me, the commonality is immunity. We cannot avoid hackers any more than we can avoid germs. We need to maintain basic hygiene, but we also need a few germs and viruses to train our immune systems. A strong immune system makes us resilient.</p>
<p>Both keynote speakers were also asked about education. Both refused to opt between STEM and humanities but rather emphasised the need to learn. Whatever we learn in formal education will probably be out of date very soon, so we need to keep learning throughout our careers (and lives). This makes us professionally and personally resilient.</p>
<p>Treasurers see how their jobs are changing. As said, we do not know what the future holds. We do not know what future jobs will look like. It is critical to avoid fear, and to embrace and prepare for change. The world of education is moving to enable this – apparently, MIT has committed to put all its courses online.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we need speed to thrive under exponentiation. On the other hand, we need organisational and societal resilience to survive the unknown future. Balancing these will require skill. Things like regulatory sandboxes are a step in the right direction that can be mirrored within organisations, in project teams and the like. This is a mind-set challenge.</p>
<p>Scenario planning is also a resilience booster that came up several times. Best practice treasurers make plans for macro, liquidity, and other risk scenarios to prepare for the unexpected.</p>
<h3 id="contradictions">Contradictions</h3>
<p>One keynote in particular was emblematic of this confusing situation. Its title was Renaissance 2.0 and the yet “history is not a good guide to the future”. We were told that if you are not making money now, you have only yourself to blame because corporate profits are at historically high levels. And then reminded that mean reversion will apply. We were told this is the best of times in terms of life expectancy, poverty reduction, etc. The Renaissance was a period of opening minds and ideas that ended in a fundamentalist backlash – Savonarola’s bonfire of the vanities.</p>
<p>A strong reminder that the future will surprise us.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><h4>What general challenges does the EU referendum result create for companies with respect to international trade?</h4>
<p>Aside from the sharp fall in Sterling against other major currencies, the main challenge stemming from the referendum outcome for our clients is the considerable level of uncertainty they are now facing. As the political negotiations begin to unfold the picture will gradually become clear. Until we reach that point, there is limited clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU and its other trading partners. Key questions, including whether the UK will continue to have access to the single market or use the World Trade Organisation’s free trade agreements, remain unanswered.</p>
<p>In the meantime, it is important for companies to begin thinking about how they can de-risk their end-to-end value chains in order to manage this uncertainty. Regardless of how political negotiations develop, there will always be plenty of new opportunities ahead for UK businesses.</p>
<h4>To what extent have you discussed the UK’s decision to leave the EU with your corporate clients? What are their key concerns?</h4>
<p>As a relationship-led bank we maintain regular dialogue with our clients so it was natural for conversations to turn to the referendum in the days before and after the vote. But we have also approached the issue proactively. Our economists offered their insights into different scenarios prior to the referendum, and we have been in discussion with our clients about their strategies for managing the financial impacts and how we can support them with financial solutions.</p>
<p>Our clients’ concerns vary significantly depending on the nature of the underlying business mix, the size of the company in question, its complexity and geographical footprint. If there is one single issue that has been talked about across the board so far, it is the currency impact. The fall in Sterling following the referendum outcome is already giving rise to a wide range of impacts across end-to-end value chains. Companies in the UK that are sourcing goods, services and inputs of production from overseas have been the most heavily impacted, and many are smaller clients who might lack the internal resources to implement a sophisticated currency hedging strategy. Net importers are now looking to understand to what extent rising costs can be passed on to customers and how that might affect their competitiveness domestically and internationally. On the flip side, exporters are becoming more competitive, something equally important to consider.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>We also have clients, particularly within the construction and services management sectors, that are worried about how leaving the EU might impact their ability to source skilled labour from the EU. Were the UK to adopt more stringent border controls or, perhaps a points-based system, accessing that labour could become a challenge. These businesses will need to think about adapting their recruitment strategies going forward in order to minimise disruption.</p>
<p>While some specific consequences of the referendum outcome are now beginning to crystallise, it is probably the general uncertainty that is giving companies the biggest challenge at the present time. For those companies that regularly enter multi-year contracts with their buyer and supplier base this could prove more challenging for example. A contract signed today could become very unpalatable in the future, not least because of the underlying currency values.</p>
<p>Such uncertainties may weigh on trade over the long-term, but the immediate impact on trading conditions has so far been rather muted. A lot of our clients are telling us that their buying and selling relationships have returned to normal quite quickly – although we have seen a minor decrease in volumes across the clients we serve, possibly linked to an element of ‘wait and see’.</p>
<h4>What role can Lloyds Bank play in helping clients face these different challenges and seizing the opportunities presented by the UK’s decision to leave the EU?</h4>
<p>In the lead up to the referendum, Lloyds Bank focused on understanding the impacts of both possible outcomes for both the bank and our clients. Most important to us was ensuring we would be able to continue serving our clients even in a business environment characterised by considerable uncertainty. From our perspective, nothing fundamental has changed at this point. We are continuing to grow in the UK, but are also following our clients internationally through our overseas offices in the US, Europe and Asia. Lloyds Bank is still there for its clients as a solid banking partner over the long-term; we remain resolute in our determination to help our clients prosper globally.</p>
<p>With our long pedigree in supporting international trade, Lloyds Bank is well-placed to help clients mitigate the risks of buying and selling in new markets, and provide them with tools to minimise their working capital cost. We support a broad range of clients, from small-to-medium sized enterprises through to major global corporates and financial institutions. To meet clients’ needs, we have a similarly broad range of products, from simple documentary collections through to bespoke structured trade solutions. A good example of how we can help our clients is through the Letter of Credit (LC), which we are able to offer in over 90 countries through our international network of partner banks. The LC is a great tool because it can be used by the exporter as a source of risk mitigation and liquidity, but also by the importer to ensure supply performance.</p>

<div class="copy__body"><h4>How do you envisage your work with the Department for International Trade and International Chamber of Commerce will prepare businesses to meet possible arrangements for the UK leaving the EU?</h4>
<p>In 2015, we became the first UK bank to enter into a strategic partnership with UK Trade and Investment (UKTI), now called the Department for International Trade (DIT). Under the terms of the five-year agreement, we will be supporting an additional 5,000 first-time exporters per year, every year. This target will help contribute to the UK government’s goal of helping 100,000 businesses start trading overseas by the end of the decade.</p>
<p>We added to this commitment in July 2016 by signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with DIT to work together on the development of a unique online database. This database matches importers and exporters to help UK businesses forge new relationships overseas. With the truly global reach DIT has through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the database has the potential to be a really useful tool for UK companies to link to contacts around the world. Another organisation we are also building a relationship with is the International Chamber of Commerce, which has a wide reach across the global economy. This is another resource that importers and exporters can use to support their international trading.</p>
<p>Lloyds Bank is entering into these partnerships principally because we recognise the importance of exporting for the British economy. Post-referendum, large and small UK businesses will increasingly need to look to overseas markets for growth opportunities. Encouraging more businesses to take advantage of the opportunities by looking to export to new markets should help to reverse the UK’s current account deficit, and help them to de-risk through accessing new revenue streams. The old adage rings truer than ever: with change comes opportunity.</p>
<h4>What investments are being made by Lloyds Bank in the trade space – and how will these benefit clients going forward?</h4>
<p>Increased investment in our digital capability is a strategic priority for the Bank. We are building a new processing platform which will process traditional trade instruments such as Letters of Credit, Guarantees and Documentary Collections and we are also investing in a new Supplier Finance platform. Recognising that corporate clients are increasingly telling us they want digital platforms that will enable them to operate in a multi-bank fashion, we are exploring how we open up our infrastructure to other multi-bank channel providers.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>This year we will also be launching a new International Trade Portal, through which businesses looking to import and export can identify new opportunities across the globe. This will allow a treasurer at a company that is expanding its overseas trading activities to find out exactly what the documentary requirements are, what the country looks like in terms of risk, and who they might be able to trade with in that country. Effectively, what we are doing is using our specialist knowledge and insight to create a rich picture of the business environment for our clients to use. And when one overlays that information with what is available on the DIT platform, we are left with a really powerful end-to-end offering for our clients.</p>
<h4>Finally, what key advice would you give to corporates as they look to manage uncertainty created by the UK’s decision to leave the EU?</h4>
<p>In the short term the UK will remain a member of the EU and will continue to trade business as usual. In our view our clients should use this transitional period to prepare for the future by considering ways to de-risk their value chains. Beyond the borders of the EU there are real opportunities for companies to trade internationally, particularly in some of the high-growth emerging markets. Now is the time for companies to start thinking about these opportunities and how they will manage the risks around importing and exporting into new markets.</p>
<p>How companies adapt to the challenges they now face will be key. For instance, a fall in the value of Sterling presents a significant risk management challenge for companies with international supply chains. However, if the company is also exporting internationally, it might see a net benefit from the fall in Sterling if it were able to find a way of sourcing more of its inputs domestically. Companies outside of the UK may need to be sensitive to the sharp increase in cost for British firms. Negotiating more favourable payment terms for their buyers may help ensure sustainability of the supply chain, and trade instruments are a great way to do this. These are the types of questions companies should be thinking about.</p>
<p>On the whole, our clients are responding positively to the referendum outcome. They are telling us that they are excited about the prospect of building their businesses in this new paradigm. And we will be there to help them on their journey of growth and diversification.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>Treasury metrics should link up to the departments overall goal, which will be some form of cost effective risk reduction. However, performance can only be properly defined in terms of parameters that are in practice subjective, and therefore must be set by the board of directors. In this article I explore the various metrics that treasury may wish to employ.</em></p>
<p>Corporate treasury has an incredibly diverse set of responsibilities and consequently varied goals. However, for most departments their objectives are likely to be some form of cost effective risk reduction (CERR). After all, non-financial corporates want to reduce financial risk so that more of the firm’s resources can be devoted to the core business.</p>
<p>But each firm will have a different view on what cost effectiveness means, and the same can be said for their risk tolerance. As a result, it is the board that has to decide on the parameters within which treasury has to work.</p>
<h3 id="capital-structure">Capital structure</h3>
<p>Capital structure is probably the core treasury related decision that the board has to answer, and its results ripple through the entire treasury operation.</p>
<p>At its simplest, treasurers need to know how much leverage to have and how much cash to hold. An important follow on detail is how much long tenor debt to issue – from a CERR perspective, long tenor debt is less risky but more expensive.</p>
<p>The target duration is, of course, closely related but I will cover that under interest rate risk.</p>
<p>From a CERR perspective, the optimal capital structure gives the lowest sustainable weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The strategic variables include leverage, tenor and cash. High leverage reduces cost and sustainability, and low leverage increases cost and sustainability (because equity is more expensive than debt but does not have to be repaid). Equally, short tenor reduces cost and sustainability, and long tenor increases cost and sustainability (because long tenor debt is more expensive than short tenor debt but reduces liquidity risk). And low cash balances reduce cost and sustainability, large cash balances increase cost and sustainability (because cash yields much less than WACC but reduces liquidity risk).</p>
<p>A quick scan of current corporate practice – especially with approximately $5trn of corporate cash – shows that boards seem to be leaning heavily in favour of sustainability, presumably fearing macro-economic uncertainty may increase both financial and commercial risk.</p>
<p>Although there are mathematical models, such as the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), which help to optimise WACC – they assume that the markets provide valid input about the riskiness of the firm. Certainly market inputs require consideration, but having lived through at least a decade of distorted markets, they cannot be the only input. Ultimately this decision is a key management responsibility, and from a governance perspective that means a board decision.</p>
<p>There are a number of methodologies the board can use to define capital structure, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fixed numbers and ratios.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Following peers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operational metrics (ie keep six months operating expenses in cash).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Target rating.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In all cases, there has to be some range that allows treasury operational flexibility.</p>
<p>My favourite is the target rating. This gives the treasurer (and CFO) more flexibility to optimise WACC, and provides an easy to understand metric for investor and customer relations. A common strategy is to target one level above “junk” to give some room to weather adversity. Again there is no one right answer – it depends on financial and commercial market constraints (for example, customers often worry about financial solidity of their suppliers).</p>
<h3 id="cash-management">Cash management</h3>
<p>Cash management can be broken down into balance management and flow management, and each require relevant metrics.</p>
<p>For balance management, the key issue is cash concentration – how much of total cash is available for corporate needs such as paying down debt, business development, etc? We want to minimise cash leakage in the form of trapped cash or simply lazy cash that we have not concentrated. The cost of concentrating cash is a material but secondary metric (depending on how critical cash is for each corporate).</p>
<p>Flow management is basically a cost game. It is important to realise that cost reduction in this context is more about eliminating bank fees (by taking flows out of the banking system with payment aggregation and netting) rather than haggling down bank fees. In this respect, in-house banks (IHB), on-behalf of structures (OBO), netting et al are all very helpful.</p>
<p>In case you think I am missing some important credit and operational risk metrics, consider that for balance management concentration maximises cash in treasury’s hands which implies that treasury will rigorously apply the group credit risk policy. And for flow management, cost reduction must measure all in cost, including in house FTEs and cost of errors, not just bank fees.</p>
<h3 id="foreign-exchange-risk">Foreign exchange risk</h3>
<p>Foreign exchange risk policy and metrics is another somewhat subjective area – which means board level decision making. For example, some groups forego hedging altogether for more or less philosophical reasons, others hedge only balance sheet exposures to avoid the hassle of hedge accounting, while others try to hedge the entire business cycle. Like capital structure, there is no Excel model that will give you the ineluctable answer, so it has to be a board decision.</p>
<p>The first decision is what to hedge – nothing, balance sheet (whatever causes FX revaluations in the accounts), or cash flow/margins (normally balance sheet plus orders and some forecasts). In the last case, we also need to decide what tenor to hedge (commonly six to 18 months, depending on the pricing cycle). Additionally, we need to know the hedge ratio – what percentage of the measured exposure should we hedge, and what variation around that target is permissible.</p>
<p>With those decisions put in place by the board, operational metrics for treasury are quite simple – basically have we followed the board policy and how cost effectively? To the extent that the board allows some discretion to treasury (small over and under hedging, use of options rather than forwards), then we can measure the risk adjusted cost compared to a benchmark (exactly following the policy using market forward rates).</p>
<p>The big benefits will come less from fancy hedging strategies and more from rigorous netting of exposures and even adjusting business models to reduce what has to be hedged in the market.</p>
<p>It is easy enough to play around with swaps and swaptions to try to beat the market – though actually beating the market can be hard absent central bank distortions. But what surprises me is how few corporates are clear about their benchmark duration.</p>
<p>In my experience, duration is hard to pin down in the real economy. Even long-term plant with thirty or more years payback tends to have revenues that follow business cycles, implying a relatively short duration – a big exception again is government distortions such as electricity off take agreements.</p>
<p>So once again, benchmark or neutral duration is a matter for the board to decide (because it cannot be calculated quantitatively) and of course they have to fix risk limits in terms of permissible deviation from neutral.</p>
<p>Once the benchmark or neutral duration is fixed, treasury can get on with trying to beat it – ie to achieve a lower than benchmark cost of debt within the board determined capital structure and duration constraints.</p>
<h3 id="other-metrics">Other Metrics</h3>
<p>The metrics described above are “strategic” for treasury in the sense that they come from the board. Metrics for forecasting and for front- middle- and back office are operational – treasury can decide how best to execute within the parameters set by the board (within the policy and cultural constraints of the firm, of course).</p>
<p>Once the board has set the parameters, treasury must set performance metrics on an ‘all in’ basis. This ensures that secondary issues such as internal control and process efficiency will be covered and built into the overall metrics framework. For example, outstanding reconciling items typically take expensive time to resolve and may incur overdraft and other fees, so metrics about outstanding reconciling items go beyond internal control (which is also important) and address all in cost.</p>
<p>Of course, there will often be control metrics around corporate Sarbanes-Oxley (and equivalents) compliance. The important thing is that treasury specific metrics should have clear causal links into treasury’s overall goal of cost effective risk reduction (CERR).</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Treasury metrics can only be set in the context of risk parameters that are company specific and somewhat subjective. Such parameters have to be set by the board of directors, because they affect the company as a whole and because they cannot be determined with empirical quantitative methods.</p>
<p>With the parameters established by the board, treasury can build a coherent framework of metrics to help them manage treasury towards the overall goal of CERR.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p><em>Amid all the recent market uncertainty, corporate focus on financial supply chain management has never been stronger. But for banks, identifying and delivering the right working capital solutions to corporates requires a strong understanding of not only their clients’ financial supply chains but their physical supply chains too. In this article, we talk to Wayne Mills, Head of Receivables, Asset Based Lending and Corporate Asset Finance at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking.

<div class="copy__body"><h4>In supply chain management, why is it so important for companies to focus on financial supply chains as well as the flows of physical goods and information?</h4>
<p>It is absolutely crucial to consider both the financial and physical supply chains when working to optimise working capital. How a company manages working capital – the time it takes to pay creditors and, conversely, be paid by its debtors – is heavily influenced by the physical supply chain.</p>
<p>It is therefore incumbent upon us as a bank to understand how our clients’ physical supply chains work so we can deliver the right solutions for their financial supply chains. It is about getting to know the client, and understanding the inherent risks when financial and physical supply chains are not aligned.</p>
<p>There is always the danger of a ‘disconnect’ if financial solutions are implemented without consideration of the physical supply chain. For any company endeavouring to optimise working capital, the level of internal stakeholder collaboration is crucial. Although most bank relationships are treasury-led, when we talk with clients about supply chain finance (SCF) there is often a need for a wider discussion with other functions such as procurement and IT. The need for positive engagement and support from those stakeholders (some of which may be working to different Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) from treasury) is, in my experience, one of the most significant barriers to the better integration of the physical and financial supply chains.</p></div>

</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Another major barrier to integration arises from definitional confusion. Often one of the first items on the agenda in meetings with new clients is establishing what, precisely, SCF means to them. There are a multitude of providers offering SCF solutions within the financial sector at the moment. Each tend to have their own terminology for what is essentially the same thing. When one bank speaks about SCF and another about reverse factoring it can become, quite understandably, very confusing for the client. The approach we take at Lloyds Bank is to recognise the simple truth that for every buyer there is a seller. This then allows us to speak in terms of a ‘seller-led’ Receivables Purchase programme or a ‘buyer-led’ Supplier Finance programme. This simple distinction allows us to clearly determine our client’s view on the extent to which they wish to control the programme. We have a number of clients who prefer to sell their receivables to us through their own “seller-led” programme whereas others are happy to on-board to their customer’s supplier finance programme.</p>
<p>Often there will be a choice for clients to make when thinking about the degree of control they wish to retain with any supply chain financing solution when compared against price advantage, for example, where a rating mismatch offers an ability to secure liquidity based on a better-rated counterparty.</p>
<p>This is why we need to develop a clear understanding of what SCF actually means to our clients. It is especially important for us as we continue to move away from what was, historically, a product-led model to one based on relevant and timely client-specific needs. The question we always ask ourselves is whether the solution is the right fit for the client – irrespective of the different nametags people may give it.</p>

<h3 id="bringing-physical-and-financial-supply-chains-together">Bringing physical and financial supply chains together</h3>
<p>To underscore why understanding both clients’ physical and financial supply chains is so important, we look at the role Lloyds Bank played recently in supporting a company’s efforts to improve working capital.</p>
<p>Lloyds Bank’s client is a UK-based industrials company with operations across EMEA and North America. As part of a wider working capital optimisation project, the company was looking for solutions to help it manage the impact of payment terms being extended by its customers. Discussions were initiated with Lloyds Bank. The bank was able to identify and deliver the ideal solution for the client – but only after it had considered the entire spectrum of who the client buys from and sells to alongside its approach to risk management.</p>
<p>A multi-currency seller-led receivables purchase solution was structured for the sale of outstanding trade receivables in the UK and in certain European territories. This would help mitigate the impact of payment term extensions. The solution had an immediate positive impact. Contract renewals increased and, largely thanks to the flexibility now provided by payment terms, better pricing was negotiated with some customers.</p>
<p>Lloyds Bank’s understanding of its client’s physical and financial supply chains also enabled it to identify certain relationships where the client could support its supplier base with its superior credit rating. A buyer-led supplier finance programme was accordingly set up for selected suppliers in the UK and Europe.</p>
<p>“When viewed on a combined basis, both solutions provided our client with the required mix of liquidity management, balance sheet treatment and control,” says Wayne Mills. But the bank’s commitment to understanding the client does not end at the point a solution is implemented. “We regularly keep under review the performance and relevance of the solutions as the client’s business grows and evolves,” Mills adds, “especially given the current volatility we see across markets.”</p>
</div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4>What role can banks play in facilitating the integration of financial and physical supply chains?</h4>
<p>Bringing it all to life is all about successful execution and, for a bank, this ultimately comes down to having the right business and distribution model to support clients.</p>
<p>To that end, having the right sector and solutions focus is obviously important. Lloyds Bank has experts focused on particular industries collaborating closely with colleagues focused on particular solutions such as trade or SCF. Having the right coverage model helps us ensure we are talking to the right clients at the right time and in the right way.</p>
<p>Our ‘client first’ approach is more than a mere vision statement: it is something all of us genuinely live at Lloyds Bank. That’s why we have focussed on building really strong internal collaboration across our teams so that we can work together to provide clients with end-to-end solutions. If a colleague from within our trade business, for example, identifies a suitable solution residing in a different area of the bank, our business model positively supports and encourages that colleague in collaborating across the business to deliver that solution to the client.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote>Overall this has to be a good thing for the market. Fintech is keeping the banking sector on its toes, and its rise is creating a more competitive landscape for clients. For Lloyds Bank it is a tremendous opportunity.</blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source"></p>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>As a recent case in point, we successfully supported a client with a funding solution involving multiple asset classes alongside more traditional trade solutions including Letters of Credit. The key to successfully delivering this for our client was a truly collaborative approach across internal teams, harnessing the common understanding of the client’s objectives.</p>
<p>Such collaboration is of critical importance when it comes to supporting our clients in the integration of physical and financial supply chains. The opportunities it presents for colleagues to interact with different areas of the business has an additional benefit to the bank. It helps our teams to broaden their knowledge and skill base, which in turn helps us in finding and delivering the appropriate solutions.</p>
<h4>With supply chains becoming ever more globalised, the support a bank can offer corporate clients cross-border is increasingly important. How is a UK-focused retail and commercial bank such as Lloyds Bank able to accomplish this and cover its clients’ end-to-end supply chain?</h4>
<p>Our aim at Lloyds Bank is always to support our clients’ trading activities, whether those activities are of a cross-border nature or limited to the domestic market.</p>
<p>Our ability to do that rests on two key elements. Firstly, we have local teams based in-country across our existing franchise which spans a number of markets in Europe. We have hubs in key locations – France, Germany and the Netherlands, as well as our franchise in North America. In addition to our presence in those markets, we recently opened new offices in Singapore which is our hub for supporting our clients’ business needs across Asia. Our clients informed us that much of their trade flows were passing through the Asia Pacific region, so we decided to invest and strengthen our capabilities there. Secondly, we look to utilise the other relationships we have through a partner bank model. In certain circumstances, it may not be economic to invest directly in a certain territory, but that does not prevent us from supporting our clients by, for example, utilising the local capability of another carefully selected financial institution.</p>
<p>Overarching all of this, of course, is the fact that Lloyds Bank has a sincere commitment to the UK economy. We recognise that our clients are trading far more widely than ever before and, indeed, often across borders. Helping them to do that is all part of meeting that core principle of supporting the growth of the UK economy and our clients.</p>
<h4>In a developed market where clients typically have good credit ratings and access to liquidity, how does the bank deliver relevant, capital efficient solutions to large corporates?</h4>
<p>Again it comes back to having a strong understanding of our clients and their operations. There are a growing number of providers of financial services and a considerable amount of excess liquidity in the market. Our response to that is to focus on our core strengths and capabilities. Honesty and transparency are important here. If as a bank you lack a particular solution in a particular market, you will only build a long lasting relationship by having an open, honest discussion with the client.</p>
<p>Clients understand and appreciate that. Treasurers do not expect banks to be able to service all their needs comprehensively in every jurisdiction across the globe – but they do expect, quite rightly, their relationship banks to be straightforward with them.</p>
<p>Fostering those longer-term relationships is the top priority for Lloyds Bank. That means striving to work very closely with clients and maintaining good quality two-way dialogue so that we can better understand what they need and when. It is a source of pride when I see the length of time we have had supply chain solutions in place where most have endured for longer than five years and some more than ten years. That tells me we have successfully identified an appropriate solution in each case and continue to adapt as markets and client needs evolve.</p>
<h4>What influence do you expect fintechs to have on this market?</h4>
<p>We have seen a deluge of new entrants in the SCF space in recent years, so naturally there has been a huge amount of industry discussion on the topic. From a personal point of view, I am absolutely convinced that rather than being a threat or a disrupter in relation to banks such as Lloyds Bank, fintech can be an enabler and a facilitator. Working together with fintechs can benefit our strategy in terms of supporting clients and delivering the right working capital solutions to help them optimise their financial supply chain.</p>
<p>Our client-first approach also puts us in a strong position to collaborate with the fintech sector. Through regular dialogue, we have a deep understanding of our clients’ physical and financial supply chains. This helps us understand, when we look at the new fintech entrants, which providers can offer solutions that would be beneficial to our clients. We can therefore evaluate whether they would be suitable prospects for partnerships. Some of the new entrants have developed solutions that we think are very credible.</p>
<p>Overall this has to be positive for the market. Fintech is keeping the banking sector on its toes, and its rise is creating a more competitive landscape for clients. For Lloyds Bank it is a tremendous opportunity. If we harness it in the right way, we can achieve our goal of better supporting our clients and delivering solutions that are relevant to them now and in the future.</p></div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>Following queries on my ‘Cash management tools compared’ article, it seems useful to follow up with another view of liquidity management. In the previous article, I analysed how different cash management tools can help treasurers. Here I will look at the issues facing treasurers around liquidity management, and show how the different tools address those issues.</em></p>
<h3 id="one-global-investable-balance">One global investable balance</h3>
<p>Broadly the goal of balance management (aka liquidity management) is to concentrate cash balances across the group and around the world with the end goal being one global investable balance.</p>
<p>Treasurers want their cash in one place. They want all their cash under their control. They want to invest all their cash according to their investment policies. Of course, the specifics may differ (Americans will often have cash onshore and offshore separated to avoid Subpart-F issues), but the principle remains the same.</p>
<p>Certain business models (reinvoicing, principal structures, etc) tend to concentrate cash in a single legal entity, but in practice material cash balances will always be dispersed across the foot print of the group. This is an inevitable consequence of global business.</p>
<h3 id="dispersed-cash">Dispersed cash</h3>
<p>Cash is dispersed on different dimensions, each creating different challenges for treasurers (and thus requiring different tools). The three main dimensions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Legal entities: at a minimum, cash will be in one legal entity per country. Concentrating cash across legal entities will have tax and possibly regulatory consequences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bank accounts: different legal entities will have their own banks accounts (except in an effective in-house bank (IHB). In an international group, these bank accounts will be with different banks. Even when mono-banking, the accounts will be with different branches of the bank, which creates many of the same issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Currencies: entities are likely to have balances in their operating currency, and often in other currencies as well. One global investable balance must somehow be in one currency; preferably a currency with deep liquid money markets.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that we have clarified the three dimensions of the cash concentration problem, we can look at the specific challenges in each dimension and explore which tools best address these challenges. Before looking at how we can address these three issues, it will be helpful to clarify the tools we can apply – sweeping and notional pooling and IHB.</p>
<h3 id="sweeping">Sweeping</h3>
<p>Sweeping means moving cash from one bank account to another. The bank accounts may belong to the same legal entity or to different legal entities. For example, cash may be swept from a legal entity’s operating account (often onshore) to the same entity’s pooling account (often offshore).</p>
<p>When used in conjunction with multi entity notional pooling to create an overlay, sweeping does not create intercompany balances (because cash is swept from an operating account in the name of the legal entity to a notional pooling account in the name of the same legal entity; thus the cash stays in the same legal entity). Sweeping between legal entities creates intercompany balances. Typically operating entities sweep to a treasury or head office entity. As stated above, intercompany balances create tax concerns including transfer pricing on resulting intercompany interest and related BEPS issues.</p>
<p>A pure IHB does not require sweeping, because operating entities do not have any bank accounts since the IHB handles all their payments and collections on behalf of the operating entities through the IHB’s bank accounts. In some countries, for regulatory or commercial reasons, the IHB may use local bank accounts in the name of the operating entity; in this case, the IHB will use sweeping to concentrate cash. In both cases, the IHB creates intercompany balances, so from a legal entity perspective the IHB has the same effect as sweeping (intercompany balances) even if from a bank account perspective there may be no sweeping (because the operating entity has no bank account).</p>
<p>Sweeping can be done in various ways – manually, by standing order, by corporate systems and by banks. The difference between these is in the degree of automation and the service provider. The result from both legal and cash management perspectives is substantially the same.</p>
<p>Sweeping can be one way and two way. One way sweeping typically moves excess cash from operating accounts to a pooling account, so that the operating entity is always depositing cash in the pooling account. Two way sweeping allows the operating entity to have an overdraft, so when the operating account is short of cash the sweep is from the pooling account to the operating account. In many arrangements, the previous night’s sweep is reversed the following morning so that the operating bank account reverts to its original balance during banking hours.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote>Multicurrency notional pooling is the only (cost effective) way to concentrate cash across currencies.</blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source"></p>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Even in mono banking, there will still be sweeps between the different branches and entities of the bank to concentrate funds. One advantage of mono banking is that the bank can sweep funds across its network at close of business with good value – this means that the cash is 100% concentrated with no leakage (not every bank will offer this to every corporate, the bank needs globally integrated liquidity management itself to do this cost effectively). Cut off and other technical issues mean that sweeping between different banks can never be 100% effective.</p>
<p>Sweeping cannot address the currency issue because the cost and complexity of the overnight FX swaps that would be required is prohibitive.</p>
<h3 id="notional-pooling">Notional pooling</h3>
<p>Notional pooling is fundamentally different from sweeping in that there is no movement of cash, and therefore notional pooling results in bank balances whereas (legal entity) sweeping results in intercompany balances.</p>
<p>Notional pooling has two facets. Multi-entity notional pooling avoids the problem of intercompany balances. Multicurrency notional pooling addresses the currency problem. Multi-entity multicurrency notional pooling is common.</p>
<p>To the extent that groups have a requirement to concentrate cash from different countries, notional pooling is combined with bank account sweeping in what is often called an overlay. Since cash is swept from an operating account to a pool account both owed by the same legal entity, no intercompany balances are created.</p>
<p>Multicurrency notional pooling is the only viable way to address the currency issue (because the overnight FX swaps required to do so in a sweeping arrangement are too expensive and complex). Because of this, single entity multicurrency notional pooling is often used to address the currency issue when sweeping or when an IHB has been used to concentrate cash across legal entities and bank accounts. In this scenario, the single entity multicurrency notional pool will concentrate cash across multiple currencies which belong to the pool master or IHB.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Legal entities.</h5>
<br/> <p>Concentrating cash across legal entities may create tax and, depending on the country, regulatory issues.</p>
<p>Since the regulatory issues are country specific, they are too diverse to address in this article. One key point is that regulatory issues are often less intractable than they seem when analysed with granularity.</p>
<p>The tax issues relate to possible intercompany balances and the tax treatment of interest (or even the lack of interest) thereon. Intercompany balances will generate transfer pricing and BEPS concerns.</p>
<p>The two common tools that address cash concentration across legal entities are sweeping and notional pooling.</p>
<p>Sweeping between legal entities creates intercompany balances, which have tax and regulatory consequences. Notional pooling results in bank balances. The distinction is fundamental. The decision about which is preferable depends on the tax position and corporate culture. Corporate practice seems to be roughly equally spread, with a mix of hybrids as well. One common practice is to use multi entity notional pooling for day to day liquidity combined with intercompany balances in the form of term loans for structural borrowing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Bank accounts.</h5>
<br/><p>Bank account sweeping is required for all but the simplest liquidity management. If all the operating accounts are at one branch of one bank, then bank account sweeping can be avoided. Since most groups cover multiple countries and use multiple banks, bank account sweeping will be required.</p>
<p>Notional pooling can only operate effectively (ie be capital efficient) in one branch of one bank.</p>
<p>It is practical to arrange an end of day sweep of the concentrated cash balance to an appropriate interest bearing instrument – commonly a money market fund or bank deposit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Currencies.</h5>
<br/> <p>The currency issue can only be addressed by notional pooling. Cross currency sweeping requires overnight FX swaps that are too complex and expensive to be effective.</p>
<p>Without notional pooling, treasury will have to manage the concentrated currency balances manually – either by choosing to trade FX spots or swaps (which will not be cost effective) or by investing each currency separately (which is a lot of work and negates the scale benefits that cash concentration aims for).</p>
<p>Notional pooling can address both the legal entity and the currency issues. These can be decided separately. So an IHB might use intercompany balances for the legal entity issue combined with a single entity multicurrency notional pool to address the currency issue. Other corporates use multi-entity multicurrency notional pooling to address the legal entity and currency issues combined with bank account sweeping to address the bank account issue – the result is often called a liquidity overlay or overlay structure.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="review-and-conclusion">Review and conclusion</h3>
<p>Pulling this all together, there are two key decisions for treasurers.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Intercompany balances or bank balances?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manual or automated currency management?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The answer to the first will determine whether to use sweeping or notional pooling to address the legal entity issue. The answer to the second will determine whether to use multicurrency notional pooling.</p>
<p>The two decisions are entirely separable as we have seen in the examples above. An IHB can also be adapted to any configuration of decisions.</p>
<p>The three issues in corporate balance management are to concentrate cash across legal entities, across bank accounts, and across currencies. Across legal entities the decision is between sweeping (resulting in intercompany balances) and notional pooling (resulting in bank balances). Sweeping is the only way to move cash between bank accounts, and is required in all but the simplest arrangements. Pure IHB does not require sweeping but results in intercompany balances and does not address the currency issue. Multicurrency notional pooling is the only (cost effective) way to concentrate cash across currencies. All of the above can be combined to suit the needs of diverse corporates.</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Listen in to any mainstream conference session where treasurers are asked what they want from their banks and the excitement is often ratcheted up a few notches. There will be more than a handful of responses listing what the particular audience does not want typically bemoaning the act of ‘being sold to’ rather than being treated as respected partners. But amongst the opprobrium will be found nuggets of information that all bankers in the room would do well to act upon. For treasurers, choosing the right banking partner is a matter of utmost seriousness, perhaps even the commercial equivalent of tying the matrimonial knot – and the earnestness with which that choice is made must be fully reciprocated for it to succeed.</p>
<p>Most financial institutions aim to provide intelligent solutions, build a stronger and more open relationship with their customers and deliver everything with a professional flourish. But the list of treasury requirements goes so much deeper than common platitudes. In no particular order (and with due credit to the Association of Corporate Treasurers), that wishlist is likely to include fairness, clarity, relevance, innovation, choice, proactivity, respect, confidentiality, and a keen eye on future developments. It is quite a list and one which, if delivered, will act as a mark of distinction.</p>
<p>One bank that has taken stock of the treasury community’s wants and needs and, in light of this understanding, sought to reinvigorate its strategic agenda, is Royal Bank of Scotland. For Paul Thwaite, the bank’s Head of Transaction Services, the measures it has implemented now set out its stall for the long term but, importantly, also serve as a timely reminder of who its clients are and why it is important to deliver what they need: in the current somewhat volatile economic environment, Thwaite is absolutely convinced that the true bank-client relationship needs to be acknowledged.</p>
<h3 id="a-broader-view">A broader view</h3>
<p>The corporate treasurer is today faced with a host of practical issues. Not least of these will be in trying to strike a balance between running an efficient day-to-day operation, and the unending pressure that comes from safeguarding the function’s capacity to support the organisation’s long-term goals. It can do the job today, but what about tomorrow?</p>
<p>Of course, cost efficiency has always been a key driver here and remains so, as indeed has the need to be operationally effective, delivering an optimal service to internal and external clients. “But most treasurers will have also perceived a mounting need to look beyond their immediate treasury remit, to engage with and support the wider business strategy, taking on an ever-expanding sweep of responsibilities: in essence, the role is more complex now than it has ever been.”</p>
<p>In seeking to meet the longer-term goals of the business, no one could fail to have noticed that the regulatory back-drop has seen intense activity in recent years, driven in the main by macroeconomic events that show little sign of dampening down. All such changes must be subsumed within the treasurer’s strategic and operational development plans, with the added challenge that comes as the rapid advancement of treasury technology tests the decision-maker’s ability to differentiate between fact and fiction.</p>
<p>Moving away from the old school view that treasury is a necessary cost centre, Thwaite is alert to the fact that today’s function will position itself as one able and willing to add value to the rest of the organisation. “This is a very healthy view and one which provides an opportunity for banks and other industry partners to work alongside the treasury community to enhance its value proposition.”</p>
<p>Indeed, partnerships with third-party providers should be leveraged by corporates because therein lies expertise and solutions to potential stumbling blocks, not least in the form of direct and indirect regulatory change. View the level of cash held by some corporates in the context of Basel III’s Liquidity Coverage Ratio, for example, and it is clear that close liaison with banks is essential. The issue of impediment is of course broader than the regulatory piece, notes Thwaite. The prognosis on the economic environment, for example, looks somewhat different today from how it did just a matter of months ago in late Q3 2015: contemplation of a ‘lower for longer’ interest rate scenario will force a different set of responses from the treasurer. The challenge of dealing with the ‘here and now’ issues – such as galloping regulatory change, tumultuous economic conditions and sinister cybercrime – whilst trying to equip and build treasury for the future is clearly ongoing.</p>
<h3 id="a-true-partner">A true partner</h3>
<p>When corporate treasurers seek to match commercial threats with the skills of their banking partners, it should be considered that opportunity is often born out of adversity. In other words, it makes as much sense to actively seek the support of a respected partner to discover every positive, as it does to seek their advice on the negatives.</p>
<p>It is the role of the true banking partner, in the words of Thwaite, be part of a “holistic relationship” where the sought-after balance between current and future corporate needs is met head-on with a tailored mix of ideas, advice, services and products. To this end, he feels that creating a transparent and open connection with the corporate across all touchpoints leads to an agreeable level of proactivity on the bank’s part. Such an empathetic approach yields honest discussion and the mutual development of ideas and insights which are capable of supporting the immediate goals of treasury and those of its progressively wider corporate remit.</p>
<p>Adding value in this way may further be established by the bank through investment in its own technology and innovation processes, improving the resilience and quality of its proposition. This in turn enables clients to develop more efficient and robust operational models of their own. “At RBS we are clear that we put the customer at the heart of what we are trying to develop in our transaction and treasury services business,” states Thwaite. “We have invested significantly both in the systems and infrastructure of today, and in the propositions that we will take to customers in the future.”</p>
<p>The positive experience of treasurers when dealing with banks can be undermined when the relationship is seen by the bank solely as an opportunity to up-sell and cross-sell its products. An aggressive sales-oriented push is much maligned by treasurers so when engaging strategically at a relationship level, banks must develop a deep understanding of what the corporate client and its treasury function is trying to achieve, insists Thwaite. In such a case, he feels proactivity that introduces industry insight or best practice alongside sales ideas “can add value to the broader aspirations of the corporate client”. Providing there is mutual understanding about what the priorities are, and the bank can deliver support and ideas consistent with that, he believes treasurers “will embrace the approach”.</p>
<h3 id="giving-clients-what-they-want">Giving clients what they want</h3>
<p>The capacity to deliver ideas and insights has been in the spotlight more since the onset of the financial crisis. Although he acknowledges that there is “still some way to go”, Thwaite comments that recent industry surveys have tended to indicate a higher degree of satisfaction amongst the treasury community with what their banks provide. The effort undertaken since 2008 has, for example, made deep inroads into the simplification of processes.</p>
<p>Development of the digital arena in particular exemplifies this positive evolution, enabling the removal of a significant proportion of costs. “There is a lot more transparency across the industry and banks have become more open to agnostic solutions,” he adds. The call for bank-agnostic technology as a means of easily unhitching from one provider, may send silent shockwaves through the industry but, says Thwaite, this is what customers prefer. “RBS absolutely embraces agnostic technology. We have invested in our understanding of the benefits of it for corporates and are committed to making sure we can align with it to deliver what the client wants.”</p>
<p>Necessarily broad in its viewpoint, the banking sector remains on the lookout for improvements. Account opening and KYC processes are constantly under the microscope, for example. And whilst progress is being made in the use of data, Thwaite notes an industry acceptance that “additional effort” is required to advance the ways in which banks harvest, process and deliver information to afford clients superior decision-making. Naturally, he adds, there is constant investment in the resilience and security of systems within this ever-evolving landscape. “All banks, including RBS, are increasingly looking to deliver in even better ways.”</p>
<h3 id="the-discovery-process">The discovery process</h3>
<p>Delivery of the right ideas, solutions and products by banks must commence with “open and clear conversations” at the outset of any partnership, states Thwaite. The goal is a solid understanding of what the corporate and its treasury function are trying to achieve. “It is very much a relationship-led discussion where we aim to clearly grasp what the short and medium-term priorities are for the treasurer.” Of course, priorities will vary according to indicators such as ownership, sector, industry and geography. But the early discovery phase will shed light on opportunities for mutual additional value.</p>
<p>There is a key difference that must be acknowledged when meeting the needs of new and existing clients, notes Thwaite, the latter requiring regular and structured conversations around the operational service and operational delivery of treasury. “It’s about making sure everybody understands the nature of that delivery, what is working well and where there are opportunities to improve.” The RBS approach in all cases, he adds, is to establish regular reviews to ensure that it is delivering “to its fullest extent”. Conversations will thus be had around the broadest strategic aims of the organisation – a process which affords the bank’s team the chance to review the client’s operational service “with forensic attention to detail”. This sets the scene for the subsequent delivery of insights and ideas, aligned with the treasury function’s stated targets and priorities.</p>
<h3 id="a-new-model-bank">A new model bank</h3>
<p>“We have always been and continue to be relationship-led,” says Thwaite of the RBS strategy. “We have historically made significant investment in our treasury and transaction services product set in the UK but we don’t just look at these core elements, we expand that to consider the whole relationship.” However, where many offerings – especially around core functions such as payments – have become largely standardised to the point of commodification, treasurers may find great difficulty in differentiating between one transaction bank and its corporate client services and another, especially when all tend to make similar claims around customer-centricity and product innovation.</p>
<p>For a bank that wishes to stand out from the crowd there is no dodging this issue. “It is a key focus for the industry and it is key focus for RBS,” admits Thwaite. For RBS then, its sources of differentiation are based around a ‘past, present, future’ approach to modelling perception. It starts with the “extent and longevity” of its relationships, with “very deep and long-standing connections with a significant proportion of UK plc”. History and public awareness clearly have a significant role to play in forming an emotional response but a bank still has to deliver. The second and ‘present’ strand for RBS is its recognition – not least through a variety of industry awards – of what Thwaite describes as its “very strong and compelling product set”. This extends across cash management, payments and trade finance and its breadth alone, he believes, “gives us a source of differentiation”. Complemented by “heavy investment” made in its service delivery model around core day-to-day treasury and transaction services, clients are assured of interaction “across the range of channels” as the bank seeks to enhance its future proposition.</p>
<h3 id="a-virtuous-circle">A virtuous circle</h3>
<p>RBS is characterised by the ‘focus on strength of relationship’ with its customers. Of course, acquiring new customers plays an equally important role too and this informs an additional ‘future’ strand for its differentiation model. “Acquiring new customers and delivering the products and services they want is a virtuous circle,” states Thwaite. “As new customers become the retained customers of the future, we continue to invest in our product range and service model so that as each relationship grows over the years, it deepens across those products and services,” he explains. “As those customers’ needs inevitably change in response to market forces, it helps us develop our future offerings, and so it continues.”</p>
<p>In delivering its wider strategic focus on the UK and Western Europe, transaction and treasury services remain at the heart of RBS’ corporate banking division. From SMEs through to the largest UK businesses, Thwaite speaks with confidence when stating that its investment in products and solutions, and realignment with the genuine wants and needs of its clients, perfectly positions RBS “to fulfil the strategic priorities of corporate treasurers, today and tomorrow”.</p></div>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>Derivatives have always presented delicate control risks and corporates, with their limited resources, are particularly exposed. This article explores these risks and suggests practical risk mitigation, specifically four eye FX dealing.</em></p>
<h3 id="rogue-traders">Rogue traders</h3>
<p>Some recent accounts of rouge traders in the press set me thinking about the risks for corporate treasury. Granted, many of the famous cases involving rouge traders occurred in financial institutions and trading houses. This makes sense because such institutions tend to trade huge volumes and to hold derivative positions for profit, entailing greater risk.</p>
<p>Corporates, on the other hand, generally use derivatives for hedging purposes alone and have relatively smaller volumes. That said, a derivative hedge is still an outstanding position in the derivatives book. Furthermore, corporates are often resource constrained, and cannot afford the organisational bulk and complexity that financial institutions deploy to mitigate derivative risk – leaving room for foul play.</p>
<h3 id="the-danger-of-derivatives">The danger of derivatives</h3>
<p>Most of the famous rogue trader cases involve financial instruments like stock indices, bonds, and some commodity instruments. In fact, many were in futures markets, which are relatively transparent but presumably the rogue positions were hidden in large complex positions.</p>
<p>For the corporate treasurer, the greatest dealing risk comes from pure derivatives with future settlements. Over the counter (OTC) products, often used by corporate treasurers, normally trade against credit lines which makes them more easily hidden than futures, for example, which entail margining and daily mark-to-market with brokers.</p>
<p>If we exclude commodities as a minority sport in corporate treasury, the main OTC derivatives used by corporates are interest rate swaps and FX forwards. Given that interest rate swaps tend to involve longer tenors and therefore more complex and hard to hide credit discussions, the most common vulnerability is probably from FX forwards.</p>
<p>In contrast, cash transactions such as loans, deposits and spot FX settle promptly (instantly or nearly instantly). Any damage caused from foul play can arguably be limited because the results of the transaction remain hidden for less time. There are of course exceptions to this rule. Take for instance structured notes or deposits which tend to be cash deposits with derivatives (usually options) embedded. These can pose nasty risks, but corporates should not be using these in any case.</p>
<h3 id="front-office-risk">Front office risk</h3>
<p>In the days of phone dealing, corporates simply had to trust their front office. There was little that could be done to stop a dealer who had gone off the rails from sneaking in a large unauthorised trade. And, even in the absence of malignancy, there was also the risk of human error – buying instead of selling or mistakenly adding an extra zero.</p>
<p>Whilst open plan offices have helped in creating a self-regulating environment, there is still plenty of opportunity – particularly in small teams with colleagues frequently travelling or in meetings – for a problem to occur. Moreover, small treasuries often don’t record phone lines and by the time a paper confirmation has arrived, it may be the case that the market has turned against you.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote>Visibility and segregation of duties are essential to mitigate the risk of rogue trading.</blockquote>

<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h3 id="fx-trading">FX trading</h3>
<p>For the majority of corporate treasuries, the control situation is now much better than in the days of phone dealing. Most corporates deal FX online through multi bank portals like FxAll, Currenex, 360T and Bloomberg. This gives a powerful audit trail that can be monitored by middle office in real time. A large number also use electronic confirmation, which provides near real-time awareness of FX deals – usually with segregation of duties where the front office deals and back office confirms.</p>
<p>In some parts of the world however, eFX is less well accepted. Treasurers seem to believe that they can obtain better prices from their buddies at the banks’ treasury sales desks. And some fear that eFX will damage bank relations. The reality is very different.</p>
<p>It is very clear that eFX dramatically aids price discovery. The ability to get multiple prices at once while viewing market rates is unbeatable. While it is not recommended to ask too many sources for each deal, treasurers can cover far more counterparties with eFX than by using multiple phone lines. And the risks are far lower because the eFX portals update in real-time, which is not possible with over the phone dealing.</p>
<p>On the bank relationship side, eFX allows treasurers to show more deals to more banks than would be possible by phone dealing. Thus it offers banks more opportunity to win business and can thus improve the relationships. In addition, during relationship reviews, eFX provides detailed bid data that helps banks understand how to win more business. eFX also reduces costs for banks, so everyone gains.</p>
<h3 id="four-eye-dealing">Four eye dealing</h3>
<p>A major source of dealing risk comes from one individual being able to deal alone. The Holy Grail in this respect is to have four eye dealing – segregation of duties within the dealing process itself. Note that the deal approval feature in most TMSs is no help because it happens after the deal is executed and cannot guarantee that the deal was correctly captured, or indeed captured at all, in the system.</p>
<p>One treasurer that I worked with resorted to doing FX deals by having a dealer and manager on the phone at the same time, and insisting that banks only book the deal when the manager has confirmed. This is extremely cumbersome and complex (which means operationally risky) for the banks, not to mention a waste of time for the corporate. The solution we found was to segregate roles within the eFX platform.</p>
<p>The different roles and user rights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>FX risk team.</h5>
<p>This team collects and analyses exposure forecasts from subsidiaries, and calculates the net exposure per currency to be hedged. Within the dealing platform, they have rights to enter the deal currency, amount, and maturity. They do not have the right to deal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Front office.</h5>
<p>This team comprises the dealers themselves. Within the dealing platforms, the dealers’ rights do not allow them to input currency, amount and maturity. They are only allowed to execute the deals that have previously been entered by the FX risk team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Middle office.</h5>
<p>This team monitors financial and operational risk to ensure compliance with policy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Within the dealing platform, they have read-only rights to the whole system, so they can see what is happening in real-time. They are notified with real-time emails of all significant events within the platform.</p>
<p>Obviously, confirmation, settlement and reconciliation are segregated to back office in the normal way.</p>
<p>In constructing this process, we have been able to create a system of enforced segregation between determining what is to be dealt and dealing itself – the FX risk team enters what is to be dealt but cannot deal while the front office executes deals but cannot enter what is to be dealt.</p>
<p>Not all corporates will have large enough organisations to allow different teams. That is not important. All that matters is to have different individuals take each of the roles above, to ensure proper segregation of duties.</p>
<p>Visibility and segregation of duties are essential to mitigate the risk of rogue trading. eFX platforms provide this for the most common derivatives traded by corporate treasuries. With the proper set-up of user access rights, a good eFX platform can even enforce four eye dealing – a segregation that was not practical with phone dealing.</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p><em>The burden of complying with unclear and fragmented KYC regulations is having wide reaching impacts on banks and global finance. It has also been a growing inefficiency for corporates which is intensely frustrating because meeting the authorities’ aim of transparency should not be difficult.</em></p>
<p>Regulators are wary of Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements, the global efforts to prevent anti-money laundering (AML), becoming box ticking exercises so they generally make banks liable for knowing their customers and customers’ customers (KYCC) without specifying what they consider to be adequate due process for KYC. Since this liability has amounted to considerable fines over the last few years, the banks are understandably anxious. Compliance departments are therefore showing surprising creativity in trying to manage KYC and AML liability. The result, however: corporates end up facing fragmented KYC requirements.</p>
<h3 id="the-corporate-view">The corporate view</h3>
<p>Corporates respect the authorities’ need for KYC and AML, and have nothing to hide; they would just like to see their needs met in an efficient manner. Currently, there is frustration with the lack of progress with electronic bank account management (eBAM) and electronic bank services billing (eBSB). On eBAM, banks seem to be slowing the process because their IT budgets, post the global financial crisis, are heavily skewed to compliance, despite the considerable savings that banks themselves could enjoy with better BAM processes. On eBSB, interfacing seems to be an issue as well, but we cannot help wondering if the opaque status quo is just too juicy a profit centre for banks.</p>
<p>The confusion around fragmented KYC cannot be beneficial for banks. It is bad enough that each bank invents its own (overly elaborate) wheel. It gets increasingly burdensome when different branches and departments within banks ask for different KYC documentation. This represents a huge workload on corporates at a time when macro-uncertainty, as well as slowing growth, severely limits resources. Burning time on zero value added work does not improve customer satisfaction.</p>
<h3 id="the-bank-view">The bank view</h3>
<p>Bankers do not like the current state of play either; compliance departments continuously up the ante with regard to KYC in their search for a safe haven from billion dollar fines. It is a Sisyphean task because no one knows what next year’s regulators will consider sufficient effort. The travails extend to the inter-bank space too. Previously, banks would tend to trust that their peers, being regulated entities, would be safer than non-banks. Western regulators’ AML zeal and appetite for fines has changed this. Problems with inter-bank KYC have become so fraught that KYC is threatening the global correspondent banking system, potentially leaving some developing countries unable to execute cross-border payments.</p>
<h3 id="the-regulator-view">The regulator view</h3>
<p>Regulators, keenly aware of the banking scandals of the last decade, have little time for banks’ challenges. They do however fear that if they set out clear guidelines as to what constitutes adequate KYC, such guidelines will become an alternative to deeper KYC – whatever that might be. This has resulted in a deliberate withholding of guidance while maintaining the threat of massive fines to terrorise the banks into trying to do thorough KYC, which they are arguably unable to do in reality. It does sometimes feel like this is a lazy solution to the lack of clarity in law and in regulation of the real economy that is being foisted unfairly on the banks. On the other hand, maybe it is fair to attach such burdens to rent extraction licences, but they weigh heavily on the real economy too.</p></div>

<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h3 id="current-reality">Current reality</h3>
<p>Using the US environment as an example, there are multiple layers – and levels of clarity – in KYC regulations. The first level is the customer identification process (CIP), which “enables the bank to form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of each customer.” This is reasonably well spelled out, but with the proviso that “bank must implement a written Customer Identification Program (CIP) appropriate for its size and type of business that, at a minimum, includes each of the requirements.” Hence some of the variations that frustrate corporates seeking a consistent process.</p>
<p>The second level is customer due diligence (CDD), the objective of which is “to enable the bank to predict with relative certainty the types of transactions in which a customer is likely to engage.” This is minimally detailed, and more in terms of objectives than methods, so here the banks get even more creative. And corporates get even more frustrated.</p>
<p>The third level is enhanced due diligence (EDD) for “customers that pose higher money laundering or terrorist financing risks present increased exposure to banks.” Determining which customers are “higher risk” is a judgement call left to bank compliance officers and their legal advisors, and it is open season when it comes to what is appropriate EDD.</p>
<p>In all this, the bank has to reach an understanding of the expected flows across its accounts, and thereby be able to identify potentially suspicious activity. There is also an obligation to ensure that CIP and CDD are kept up to date – another source of corporate frustration when they are in any case providing financial statements and regular business updates to their banks.</p>
<p>The reality amongst MNCs is that banks would not be banking them without commercial due diligence in the first place. So whatever the regulators’ intentions, with respect to MNCs, this is box ticking. In some ways, it feels like the regulators would like to turn the clock back 100 years to a time when your banker knew you because he lived next door and knew your parents and grandparents. Furthermore, it also seems like banks are being lumbered with responsibility for policing money flows to make up for society’s failure to properly identify people and businesses.</p>
<h3 id="pathing-the-way">Pathing the way</h3>
<p>Some possible solutions might include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Clear regulations.</h5>
<p>Regulators have a conscious – and (ironically) globally consistent – policy of leaving the details vague to avoid the risk of box ticking by the banks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Handing responsibility to more appropriate (public) authorities.</h5>
<p>Beefing up public registries to handle the responsibilities currently foisted on banks will be politically tough. As long as the banks are perceived to be doing an adequate job – and contributing generously to public coffers when they don’t – there is little motivation to change the status quo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Banks come up with a consensus position.</h5>
<p>In response to the threat of fines and the challenges to the correspondent banking model on which international flows are based, banks are working on standard platforms – notably SWIFT’s KYC registry. This is a solution that will help SWIFT’s 7,000 correspondent banks to streamline their 1,300,000 annual KYC requests – and hopefully reduce their use of the current expedient of closing correspondent relationships. Unfortunately, the banks are showing a distinct lack of KYC – or at least customer care – by refusing to let corporates join the KYC registry, even though corporates now account for 20% of SWIFT members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Corporates come up with standards.</h5>
<p>Corporates are generally not good at collective action, perhaps because they are a diverse bunch, whose goals may differ. Some notable successes in the past decade, including derivatives regulation et al, give reason for hope.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Based on recent evidence – including BCG’s corporate treasury survey, EuroFinance International in Copenhagen and SIBOS in Singapore – it seems we are close to a high enough pain threshold to trigger action. Some corporates have already started putting their data on a registry and telling banks to visit the registry rather than their offices. It can be made even better if corporates agree on common standards for corporate KYC data. This need not be complicated since the registries have already reached some degree of commonality with banks covering wide geographies. It would then be much harder for banks to insist on their in-house compliance requirements – and a strong corporate standard will make banks’ position with the regulators stronger as well.</p></div>

<p>This year’s EuroFinance international conference in Copenhagen kicked off in high style with a debate between Jose Barroso, EU President between 2004-2014, and Zany Minton-Beddoes, Editor, the Economist. It was impressive to watch these two intelligent and articulate people with very different viewpoints – Barroso relentlessly positive (while acknowledging the challenges) and Minton-Beddoes more sceptical.</p>
<p>Barroso made an interesting comment that: “Politics is making what is necessary possible.” Food for thought at a time when citizens have exceptionally low confidence in politicians. Reminds me of Friedman’s statement that “only a crisis makes the politically impossible become the politically inevitable.”</p>
<p>Barroso’s hard headed positivity seemed to set the tone for the conference. Despite many challenges (especially macro uncertainty and market volatility) and deep frustrations (in particular regulations and resource constraints), treasurers again and again shared how they are getting on with improving treasury with targeted and cost effective solutions to a broad range of challenges.</p>
<h3 id="hot-topics">Hot topics</h3>
<p>I expect that many readers could guess the key topics and challenges discussed, but the outlook on some of these seems to be shifting.</p>
<h4 id="regulation">Regulation</h4>
<p>One of the challenges most frequently cited was regulation – especially that treasurers simply do not have the time and resources to deal with it all. Yet, overall the tone was more about dealing with rather than lamenting regulation. Vendors explained how technology can help ease the burden with derivative reporting, for example. Clouds loom around Basel III extensions to intraday liquidity, but seem resolvable. Likewise it feels like all the fuss around LCR and NSFR will subside into elements in pricing discussions.</p>
<h4 id="kyc">KYC</h4>
<p>One regulation which was an enduring source of frustration was know your customer (KYC). I saw various spontaneous (and off topic) outbursts on KYC. This is clearly an area that needs rationalisation, and one where treasurers want help. Treasurers understand that the authorities want assurances that money is flowing legitimately, and are happy to do their part. What rankles is that each bank seems to be reinventing the wheel on KYC compliance, so that corporates have to meet KYC requirements in different forms and varying content for each of them and even for different parts of each bank. Banks say they don’t get clear guidelines from regulators. Regulators say they don’t want KYC debased to box ticking (which it is anyway). And so nothing gets resolved.</p>
<h4 id="notional-pooling">Notional pooling</h4>
<p>Although the treasury press is still energetically mining the rich seam of the ‘death of notional pooling’ storyline, the clear consensus from both bankers and treasurers in Copenhagen was that notional pooling is here to stay. Pricing and terms and conditions may adjust (though nothing dramatic is expected), and different players may enter and exit the market, but notional pooling is too good a tool to loose. Good news for corporates – bad news for scare mongering consultants.</p>
<h4 id="china">China</h4>
<p>China is always a hot topic – all the more so this year after the highly publicised double whammy of currency volatility and stock market wobbles has been driving fears about the success of China’s transition from export and investment fuelled growth to consumption based moderation. Most speakers were quick to point out that the CNY “devaluation” and stock market “crash” were, firstly minor blips compared to routine western market volatility and secondly well within the government’s fiscal capacity to manage. Despite all the excitement, China has increased the cross border flexibility for corporate lending and kept in place the reforms from which treasurers have benefitted. There was some concern about the recent divergence of CNY and CNH, but this is mostly an accounting issue since CNH is ipso facto at parity with CNY on delivery.</p>
<h3 id="sibos">SIBOS</h3>
<p>SIBOS is always a great conference. The 2015 edition brought over 8,000 bankers, vendors, and regulators and 200 corporates to Singapore for four days of transaction banking mayhem. Of course there was a lot of corporate, banking, regulatory, and tech discussions. What stood out for me in this SIBOS was the tech focus that seemed pervasive and brought up a lot of questions for banking and for society at large.</p>
<p>I had the privilege of moderating a panel of experienced treasurers representing regional associations from Singapore, Hong Kong, and Malaysia. This was the first time SIBOS has had an all corporate panel – even though SIBOS has had a corporate forum for several years, they have tended to have more bank than corporate speakers. Corporates are already over 10% of SWIFT members, and represent a high potential revenue stream for SWIFT, so this is entirely propitious.</p>
<p>Appropriately for SIBOS, everyone agreed on the need for seamless multi-bank connectivity (which is the major part of corporate SWIFT usage at the moment). Interestingly, reasons differed. One treasurer from a retail company cited the need to connect to local banks for deep in country coverage. Another treasurer cited the need to diversify banks in light of recent examples of banks pulling out of countries and regions. Both concerns drive the need for multiple banks, and therefore for multi-bank connectivity.</p>
<h4 id="age-of-transformation">Age of transformation</h4>
<p>Technology also came up as an area for improvement. Treasurers lamented that corporate banking lags far behind retail banking in user friendliness. American businessman, Jeffrey Immelt’s recent statement that “industry has yet to feel the benefit of internet the way consumers’ have” resonated with our panellists. This was especially felt because other streams at SIBOS were full of wonderful case studies of improved customer experience. Corporate banking awaits some spill over.</p>
<p>Fintech was all over SIBOS – impacting clearing, channels, trade, securities, compliance, and so on. Treasurers were excited about the prospect of fintech driving improvement in corporate customer experience, improving channels, and other peripheral activities. But they did not see fintech taking over banking per se – in other words banks will continue to be the store of value (bank accounts) and run core systems for transfer of value (clearing systems).</p>
<p>A recurring theme at Innotribe, SWIFT’s Fintech innovation initiative, was the move from enabling transactions (payments) to enabling commerce. It is a laudable idea. Yet, it is definitely not currently being felt over in the corporate forum. I suspect that the Innotribe crowd are thinking more about Amazon than Glencore or Lenovo when they talk about commerce.</p>
<p>Given the diversity of corporate commerce, enabling commerce will be a big job. It is not clear that banks are best equipped to do this, and even less that they can be cost effective. Most industries already have XML standards for the non-banking part of commercial processes, so perhaps banks should focus on easing the interface to existing commercial processes and platforms. This might include not losing customer reference data by ramping up ISO 20022, wider and more thorough support for remittance advices (remt.001 and industry versions), and faster and richer collection reporting.</p>
<p>This discussion reminds me of the decade old attempt to introduce e-invoices. Banks thought they could intermediate the delivery of e-invoices (and POs, DNs, etc.) between corporates. I tried to explain that corporates can send e-invoices between themselves using their own networks and standards (such as RosettaNet in the tech space) for free – why would they pay banking level fees for this? The whole thing quietly fizzled.</p>
<h4 id="fast-payments">FAST payments</h4>
<p>Whist the talk about the future of payments is extremely interesting, something that is with us right now and that was a hot topic is FAST(er) payments. Many countries have already implemented some kind of faster payments – including Singapore which implemented FAST last year – and most others are working on it. An early issue is what constitutes fast, immediate or instant” – most think same day is not good enough, but most existing fast payment systems cannot handle the 400ms required for public transport applications (imagine waiting 30 seconds to get through a turnstile).</p>
<p>There is also a schism between the RTGS crowd and those who prefer deferred net settlement. The latter creates credit risk for banks since they have to clear (credit customer accounts) before settling (receiving interbank money via central bank), however it is perhaps easier to implement and certainly less onerous for the central bank. It is good news that most fast payment systems are adopting ISO 20022 for clearing which will encourage banks to fully integrate XML in their systems and open up the value added that comes with richer data. The faster payment crowd are working together to ensure consistent ISO 20022 standards for the various flavours of faster payments.</p>
<p>Needless to say, faster payments also mean faster AML for banks. Real time system vendors will have a field day with this. And banks will have to beef up their processing of resulting exceptions.</p>
<p>Banks are working on how to deliver rich remittance advices between corporates (to aid receivables reconciliation). ISO 20022 now includes the needed standard (remt.001 et al), and the banks will handle delivery outside of the clearing systems. It’s very similar to the RosettaNet 3C6 programme we worked on a decade ago, except that remittance advices flow through banks rather than from corporate to corporate.</p>
<h4 id="a-closing-thought">A closing thought</h4>
<p>One benefit of attending SIBOS is that it gives corporates a chance to look under the hood of the banking system. A discussion on intraday liquidity did not throw up any alarms for corporates – it was mainly about banks having to report intraday liquidity under new Basel III rules. But there is (yet another) risk of unintended consequences – the morning liquidity buffers that banks typically hold to make sure payments go smoothly throughout the day may be interpreted by regulators as volatility requiring higher capital. So another rule intended to keep us safe may in fact create more systemic risk.</p>

<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>It is not just for Europe; it is used globally including countries like China, Japan and Russia that use non-roman character sets. It is not exotic; it is built on XML which is the lingua franca of corporate systems. It is not just for large companies; half of SWIFT corporate members are smaller companies. So what is holding ISO 20022 back? Largely misinformation and change aversion, says our Treasury Insider.</em></p>
<p>There has been a lot of coverage in the treasury press about new standards for immediate payments using ISO 20022. The immediate trigger was a recent announcement by Payments UK that said: “The landmark first draft announced today (10<sup>th</sup> August 2015) is the result of work by the ISO Real-Time Payments Group (RTPG), made up of over 50 global experts facilitated by Payments UK, which has been tasked with driving forward the project of developing the ISO 20022 messages required.”</p>
<p>This is good news for corporate treasurers indeed. Whilst we may be satisfied with same day value, immediate payments will encourage the move away from multi-day settlement that remains common in many low-value clearing systems, and will reduce costs as well as delays and float. Less positive has been the implication in much of the press that ISO 20022 is itself a new innovation.</p>
<h3 id="a-trusted-standard">A trusted standard</h3>
<p>ISO 20022 XML (eXtensible Markup Language) was started in 2004, and the first messages for payments went live in 2006. So whilst this is not novel, it may be perceived as such since the standards keep advancing to handle new needs like immediate payments. Moreover, the breadth of ISO 20022 has also expanded from payments to cover areas including: securities, trade, cards and FX.</p>
<p>Corporates, including my old employers, have been using ISO 20022 to communicate with banks for a decade. It is famously the basis for SEPA (Single European Payment Area) the pan European payment system. People are less aware that ISO 20022 is also used for clearing in China (CNAPS2), Japan (Zengin and BoJNet) and Russia (CMPG) and too many countries to list all over the world.</p>
<p>XML is simply the machine-to-machine counterparty for the more familiar HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) which we know and love on our internet browsers. You are already using XML – although possibly without knowing it – it is the glue that holds corporate systems together. For example, internal messaging within SAP – called iDOCs – is XML.</p>
<h3 id="the-gold-standard">The gold standard</h3>
<p>ISO 20022 has standards for every conceivable message a corporate treasurer would want, and in fact a lot more for other financial purposes. SWIFT’s FIN MT standards were designed only for cross border high-value flows like FX settlement. ISO 20022 on the other hand, covers cheques, bank drafts, local low-value (like payroll), bulk payments, cross border and trade.</p>
<p>A group of bankers, corporates, and system vendors called the CGI-MP (Common Global Implementation – Market Practices group) has standardised most payment instruments in most countries, and is working on the rest. This means there is one standard way to get each type of payment executed regardless of which bank you use.</p>
<p>Your systems therefore need only one standard for all kinds of flows, in all geographies, in all languages, and so on. FIN was ‘patched’ to handle some of these needs, but each bank created their own workarounds – causing nightmares for treasury interconnections – and major operational risks as market infrastructures around the world upgrade to offer new services like immediate payments.</p>
<h3 id="future-proof">Future-proof</h3>
<p>Global adoption by market infrastructures and rapid standardisation of corporate connectivity by GCI-MP mean that ISO 20022 is effectively future-proof. Whatever new payment technologies come along, they will most likely be cleared in ISO 20022. Even if they are not cleared in ISO 20022, the global breath and coverage of CGI-MP mean that corporate connectivity standards will be developed at the same time as any new payment systems are rolled out. This means that treasurers using ISO 20022 effectively hedge themselves against the operational risk and cost of future developments in payment technologies and services.</p></div>

</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Moreover, being a global standard developed by corporates and banks and system vendors means that ISO 20022 is extremely well supported by corporate systems – almost all ERPs and TMSs have ISO 20022 functionality built in. This means that treasurers using ISO 20022 lower their costs and operational risks by using established and well known standards (as opposed to implementing bank proprietary standards, Excel interfaces, etc).</p>
<h3 id="double-byte-means-truly-global">Double byte means truly global</h3>
<p>There is a persistent myth in treasury circles that ‘SWIFT does not do Chinese’. This error is based on the limitations of the legacy SWIFT standard FIN, which dates from the 1970s when bandwidth was limited, and uses eight bit bytes (computer letters) which allows only 256 characters, which in turn limits FIN to the Roman alphabet. In fact, FIN started in the days of telex, which had only six bit letters, which is why everything had to be in upper case with no punctuation.</p>
<p>ISO 20022 is based on 16 bit double bytes, which allows 65,536 characters, which is enough to handle all known writing systems. And sure enough, ISO 20022 has been adopted by many non-Roman market infrastructures including China, Japan and Russia.</p>
<h3 id="market-infrastructure-vs-corporate-connectivity">Market infrastructure vs corporate connectivity</h3>
<p>It is important to be clear that ISO 20022 is used both for market infrastructures and for corporate connectivity. Market infrastructures means bank-to-bank execution of payments via the central bank for most RTGS or a local central bank approved clearing house for most local low value payments. Corporate connectivity described corporate-to-bank communications; like sending payment instructions to your bank and receiving bank statements from your bank. Most central banks and clearing houses – in almost every major country around the globe – have concluded that ISO 20022 is the best way for them to manage local clearing.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for corporates to use ISO 20022 to instruct their banks to make payments through ISO 20022 market infrastructures – you can use bank legacy formats, or BAI, or UN-EDIFACT, or even Excel. But the more market infrastructures move to ISO 20022, the more compelling it is for corporate connectivity. Conversely, you can use ISO 20022 to instruct your bank to pay over legacy market infrastructures like ACH and FIN or even cheque – and CGI-MP have standardised exactly how to do that for each case.</p>
<h3 id="global-harmonisation">Global harmonisation</h3>
<p>Another persistent myth is that ISO 20022 is not globally standardised, despite the noble efforts of CGI-MP. In most cases, this stems from treasurers perception that ISO 20022 does not take away local requirements like withholding tax in Thailand, boletos in Brazil, purpose codes in China, and so forth. While I understand these frustrations, harmonising local laws across the planet is beyond the remit of CGI-MP.</p>
<p>What CGI-MP can and does do is to standardise the way local nuances should be coded in ISO 20022 messages, so that you only need to figure it out once and it will work with all your banks. In some cases, complaining treasurers may be dealing with countries that have not yet been standardised by CGI-MP. If this is your problem, step up and join CGI-MP.</p>
<h3 id="high-value-payments">High value payments</h3>
<p>Yet another persistent myth is that ISO 20022 is only for bulk payments and that you have to use FIN for high value payments. This is based on the misunderstanding that because FIN is the de facto standard for things like FX settlements, you need to send a FIN message to your bank to instruct such a payment. I repeat what I said above – ISO 20022 covers all payment types including cross border high value, bulk payments, payroll, bankers’ drafts, etc.</p>
<p>A subtler misconception is that ISO 20022 is slower than FIN payments. When this concern came up at the most recent implementation I managed, we tested the latency of ISO 20022 messages vs FIN messages as well as checking their non-repudiation statuses. As SWIFT told us, there was no difference. So save yourself the trouble – ISO 20022 is the only message set you need.</p>

<h4>How has the rise of technology, and in particular e-commerce, transformed the Asian market, not only with regards to business-to-consumer (B2C), but also business-to-business (B2B)?</h4>
<p>The evolution of technology has had an extraordinary effect on how business is conducted globally. For instance, in the B2C world a large proportion of transactions are now completed online – worth up to $4trn a year.</p>
<p>This is a huge number that has been growing exponentially year-on-year and we expect it to continue increasing for the foreseeable future. In APAC in particular, there is lots of room for growth in this space. Today, the region accounts for roughly 30% of these flows, but 60% of the world’s population resides in the region, as do 55% of the world’s mobile devices. Moreover, 50% of the world’s internet users are based in Asia – creating a colossal market for corporates to tap into. (Continues after video.)</p></div>

<p class="quote-block__source"></p>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>There have also been changes in the B2B space. For example, a farmer in China would traditionally look to sell their produce to a co-operative, which would then sell this on at a profit by leveraging economies of scale. Today, however, the rise of digitisation and e-commerce has allowed farmers to use an online portal to immediately connect to a buyer, disintermediating the co-operative and giving the farmer the opportunity to negotiate the price they want directly with the buyer.</p>
<p>More broadly, the escalation of digital channels has fostered the rise of some of Asia’s biggest companies and also led other companies in the region to alter their business models. Digital marketplaces are perhaps the prime example of this and also most synonymous today with the term e-commerce. These companies act as a conduit between the buyer and merchant, allowing a wide variety of goods to be sold to a local or global consumer base. Some companies, especially in the technology space, as well as selling their merchandise on these global marketplaces have also established their own proprietary stores that allow the user to customise the products – frequently these online stores are replacing bricks and mortar shops, especially for Western brand names operating in Asia.</p>
<p>Moving away from B2C, we have recently seen the growth of a number of digital aggregators, offering a wide variety of cloud based solutions including: websites, software and data storage. These companies have become very popular because their solutions are flexible and allow businesses to scale up (or down) their operations, making it easier for companies to grow and expand.</p>
<p>The growth of e-commerce and digitisation have also given rise to a new breed of payment service providers (PSPs), for example Alipay. These provide online merchants and consumers with a variety of digital financial services including; e-wallets, collection services, merchant acquiring and money transfers to name a few. Companies such as these are becoming increasingly popular and are constantly innovating, looking to provide easier and more efficient ways to pay and collect. Given the wide reach of mobiles in Asia, telecommunications companies have also begun to move into this space providing services such as direct carrier billing.</p>
<h4>What new opportunities has this created for corporate treasurers?</h4>
<p>The internal and external impacts of e-commerce and digitisation have had a profound impact on corporate treasury. Typically, the treasuries of companies in the region go through a natural progression. Firstly, they begin by simply responding to the demands of the company during its early stages and ensuring that the business can function financially.</p>
<p>Once the business has established itself, the second stage commences. This is when treasurers begin to act proactively and look for efficiencies in their processes. At this stage, improvements will be made to fundamental areas of the operation such as making sure payments are made efficiently, ensuring that the right information is collected for reconciliation, and better management of working capital and liquidity. Once the treasury completes this, it can begin to better respond to the needs of the business and become a more active business partner.</p>
<p>Stage three is where e-commerce and digitisation come to the fore. As the company shifts more-and-more of its business onto digital channels, the treasurer is able to begin thinking strategically by utilising tools such as big data. This is something that we have seen occur in the treasury departments of many of our North American and European clients, and we are now beginning to see this happen in Asia as well.</p>
<p>In leveraging these new tools the treasury is able to analyse information around consumer behaviour, how the supply chain is evolving, the direction of trade flows and the various payment solutions customers utilise. By having this information, the treasury can go above and beyond and channel this into insights for the C-suite, transforming the department into a strategic business partner and helping the business maximise its opportunities.</p>
<h4>Given these developments what are the key requirements that corporates are now seeking from banks?</h4>
<p>By their very nature, e-commerce and digitisation are global. For instance, a company can be created, build an online marketplace using a cloud-based web service provider and then sell globally in a matter of weeks. In reaction to this, corporates of all shapes and sizes are requiring a core banking partner with a global network.</p>
<p>I believe this is where Citi positions itself well, particularly in Asia, as we have a wide and deep presence across the region. Furthermore, with direct memberships to 232 cash clearing systems across the globe, we are well placed to represent client interests in various country organisations and committees. As a result of our embedded presence, Citi has a fantastic track record of helping companies overcome regulatory challenges when expanding into new, and often complex markets. Successes include regulatory approvals for clients to participate in pilot programmes and implementing innovative, first-to-market solutions in countries such as India and China.</p>
<p>Our reach also enables us to solve challenges corporates face around payments, collections and in particular foreign exchange (FX). When selling, online companies often like to price in domestic currency and then convert this back into their functional currency. However, in e-commerce there are frequent refunds that often need to be made for various reasons, requiring the merchant to convert their cash back into the local currency. Consequently, there is an increased FX risk for the merchant. We have therefore worked closely with both merchants and payment providers to build structures for corporates that not only mitigate this risk, but also ensure that the refund occurs seamlessly, with minimal human intervention and also quickly – speed is imperative in the digital space.</p>
<p>When a corporate expands into new markets with its e-commerce platform, they like to offer the local payment instruments that are most used in the country. These could be cash, cards or even specialist domestic instruments. When offering this service it is important to partner with a bank that can support treasury across multiple collection streams. Citi’s network again gives us the advantage in this space as we are able to collect, move and manage cash for our clients, allowing them to focus on the core business of selling their products.</p>
<h4>Looking to the future, how do you expect the Asian market to further develop, will e-commerce become the main method of conducting business? What does this mean for corporate treasurers and what can their banks do to support them?</h4>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, APAC is a market made for e-commerce and digitisation in both B2C and B2B. Great strides have been taken towards digital by many different players in the ecosystem and a large number of our corporate clients are already at the cutting-edge.</p>
<p>There is still more to do, however. The regulatory environment and bureaucracy that exist in some Asian markets, for example, have made it difficult for certain companies to move at such speed. But, I do expect this to change, because for these countries to remain competitive they will need to facilitate more digital innovation and accept e-commerce as the new norm.</p>
<p>For banks, the drive to digital means that we will need to strive to develop more solutions that continue to support our clients as their needs evolve. These will need to be scalable and agile providing treasurers with the ability to drive efficiencies at every turn. It is also imperative that we continue to offer new and innovative ways to serve up data to our clients, leveraging new and highly visual technology, further facilitating the growth of the treasury into a strategic business partner.</p>

</div>
<p>Established in 2004, Alipay is the world’s largest third-party payment provider, offering both online and mobile payment services. The company has more than 300 million users worldwide and handles over 80 million transactions daily totalling RMB 2bn.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>In 2014, the value of e-commerce in China grew by 31.4% from the previous year totalling over RMB 13.4trn. The figures highlight the proliferation of e-commerce in the country, a space that has grown exponentially over the past decade. At the heart of this growth has been the Alibaba Group and its various online services, such as its online marketplaces. But, behind every online transaction there is a payment and third-party payment processor. Alipay has played a vital role in facilitating the growth of Alibaba, and e-commerce more broadly, by providing secure, trustworthy and convenient online and mobile payment solutions.</p>
<p>In its formative years, Alipay was primarily focused on serving the domestic Chinese market. Yet, recently its operations are becoming global as the company expands into new overseas markets such as the US, UK and Australia. To support these new business flows, the company has bolstered its international teams to serve: Chinese exporters with their cross-border collection and working capital management; importers who are trying to tap into the Chinese market; and Alipay account holders outside of China.</p>
<p>Whilst expanding into overseas markets, the company was presented with a number of challenges – most notably understanding how these markets operate. As Chen Zhiyu, Head of Product at Alipay explains: “Given our historical focus on the Chinese market most of our staff have been based domestically. We therefore have an intimate understanding of the market and our customer base. This is not always the case however when we move into new markets.”</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote>Our methodology is conflicting to this approach and we require a particular set of attributes from our financial partners – primarily dedication and flexibility in order to adapt to the pace of change we have at Alipay.</blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source"></p>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Given the pace of Alipay’s global expansion the businesses needed to plug this knowledge gap quickly. To do this, the company has hired local experts in these markets, as well as relocating some of its Chinese staff overseas. In doing so, the company has been able to obtain domestic expertise while also ensuring that the company’s culture is sustained in these overseas outposts.</p>
<p>Aside from hiring local staff, Alipay has also leaned on its partners to assist in filling the knowledge gap. “Citi is a financial partner with an extensive global network and deep presence in many markets and has provided us with detailed information and advice on a number of areas including; market practice, commonly used instruments and regulation to name but a few,” says Chen Zhiyu. “To gain this information without their help would have been a time-consuming and resource-intensive process, something we cannot afford given the pace that is needed in the e-commerce space.”</p>
<p>Speed is also imperative for Alipay when it comes to implementing new solutions. As a result of this, the company acts differently to most corporates, adopting a trial and error methodology. As Chen Zhiyu explains: “We begin a number of projects simultaneously, evaluate their effectiveness within a short space of time (typically three to six months) and then cut those that are not successful and continue with those that are.” In doing so the company is able to match the expanding needs of its customers, minimise the impact of mistakes and also foster internal focus and competition that ensure the ongoing success of the company.</p>
<p>This approach does however create some unique challenges for Alipay’s financial partners. “Banks typically work on one or two solutions at a time for a corporate client and these are usually long-term projects that will be seen through to their conclusion,” says Chen Zhiyu. “Our methodology is conflicting to this approach and we require a particular set of attributes from our financial partners – primarily dedication and flexibility in order to adapt to the pace of change we have at Alipay. Consequently, especially given the increasingly conservative nature of banks in the post-crisis era, our financial partners are limited and selected carefully.”</p>
<p>Just as Alipay is crucial in facilitating the growth of e-commerce both domestically, and increasingly overseas, Citi has been a vital partner to Alipay since 2010 – providing knowledge, advice, solutions and support to facilitate the rapid growth of the company. “We have built a strong relationship with Citi that is based on mutual understanding and trust,” adds Chen Zhiyu. “They have the attributes that we require from a financial partner allowing us to develop and expand our business at the pace we require.”</p>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h4>We’re now several years on from the global financial crisis. In what ways are treasurers still being impacted?</h4>
<p>As we all know, the global financial crisis of 2008 resulted in an increased focus on cash management, balance sheet monitoring and liquidity. The role of corporate treasury therefore grew to be even more significant in this respect, with senior executives taking a very keen interest in cash positions, buffers and exposures, and expecting frequent updates. Today, cash is certainly still king.</p>
<p>Since the crisis, a wave of new financial regulation has also been introduced, impacting the treasury function both directly and indirectly. Aside from gaining responsibility for specific regulatory-driven projects, treasury has also become even more influential in the compliance sphere. The treasurer now has increased responsibility for all risks – ranging from market risk to sovereign risk, with counterparty risk at the heart of everything. Indeed, the desire to spread risk among reliable counterparties is certainly something we are still seeing today.</p>
<p>At the height of the financial crisis, it became obvious to corporates that not all banking partners had the same creditworthiness. The strategy of having as few banks as possible turned out to be too risky – and this led directly to a change in strategy, whereby the treasury now plays a key role in choosing the right banking partners, in finding alternative sources of funding and in improving the use of excess cash. What many corporates found, once this new strategy was in place, was they could actually create a more efficient cash management and banking set-up by engaging with strong regional banks, instead of implementing a set-up with one global bank. Finally, I would say that treasury departments are coming under increasing pressure to put more efficient systems in place in order to cope with growing complexity and transaction intensity in the post-crisis environment.</p>
<h4>How can treasurers look to embrace the crisis-driven change that is still happening?</h4>
<p>Change presents an opportunity and the steady elevation and expansion of the treasury team’s role within the organisation paves the way for treasury to become an even more important partner with, and strategic advisor to, business units. This means supporting globalisation, promoting efficiency, improving integration with trading partners and the supply chain, as well as greater sophistication in risk/return optimisation.</p>
<p>As I alluded to earlier, treasury also has the opportunity to become the source that senior executives and key stakeholders throughout the organisation turn to for instant reports on liquidity and risk positions and to assess the financial impact of major events whether economic, political or environmental. This should allow the treasurer to gain an even greater trust and respect from the C-suite, whilst raising the profile and value of the treasury function internally.</p>
<h4>What new solutions or techniques are being devised to help treasurers achieve their cash and liquidity aims?</h4>
<p>It is an old truth that the key to efficient liquidity management is greater control of intra-company cash balances through centralised cash flow management. What we see now is that new technology is making it possible for treasurers to continue to optimise the use of group liquidity by taking a wider responsibility for the subsidiaries’ working capital processes.Furthermore, new ways of distributing technology – such as cloud delivery – are making it easier for a treasury function to start using, or upgrade to, tools that are more sophisticated.</p>
<p>Another established way of improving efficiency is through the centralisation of payables management. What SEPA has done is to enable treasurers to take this to the next level, by centralising receivables management as well. The rationale for this is clear: by building a collections factory and applying the receivables on-behalf-of model, the organisation can benefit from economies of scale, better credit and risk management, rationalisation of bank accounts, faster use of incoming payments, and reconciliation cost savings.</p>
<p>In terms of pooling, which is of course a traditional cash and liquidity tool, I would say the attractiveness of notional pooling is likely to decline since Basel III imposes stricter requirements on offsetting balances, but instant access to group liquidity can be made possible through physical real-time cash concentration across borders. This technique, provided by only a handful of banks today, is probably the most efficient means to minimise cash traps and idle cash, as well as to enable better visibility and control over liquidity.</p>
<h4>What else can cash management banks do to help treasurers in this respect?</h4>
<p>Today’s treasurers require more data and more analysis around cash and liquidity than ever before. They need this to monitor and feed business demand in a timely manner. With that in mind, banks must be in a position to deliver what their customers require. This means providing presentational tools, such as dashboards, to help treasurers consume and interpret this data – and also in a mobile environment.</p>
<p>Whilst this is an obvious area for investment by banks going forward, some banks have struggled thus far to aggregate and coordinate data supply since many of them are using aged core systems that cannot cope. And although certain banks are managing with old technology at the moment, there will come a time that these legacy systems will have to be changed in order to enable banks and customers to embrace the benefits of new technology and move forward to the next stage of development. It may be a painful experience for many banks to make such a big change, but it will absolutely be necessary.</p>
<h4>Is centralisation still the best way to solve cash and liquidity visibility challenges? How is innovation enabling more treasury departments to achieve a greater degree of centralisation?</h4>
<p>In most cases, full optimisation in the use of group liquidity requires the centralisation of payables and receivables. But even though centralisation is a key enabler for efficient liquidity management, it has often been difficult for treasury functions to obtain, largely due to a lack of standardisation among banks and the need to invest in expensive technology.</p>
<p>Again, the introduction of SEPA has changed the rules here, making it possible to master euro payments and collections to and from counterparties in many countries through accounts (and in some instances a single account) held in one country. Whilst this may have seemed like a daunting step when SEPA was relatively new, the success stories from the first movers are now rapidly spreading across the corporate community. This is creating an incentive for more companies to establish payment and collection factories and to implement payables and receivables on-behalf-of structures.</p>
<p>Cloud technology and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) models are also playing a role in the drive towards centralisation. For example, they are making it less expensive for treasuries and shared service centres (SSCs) to employ technology solutions that are more sophisticated – and up-to-date. In turn, cherry-picking the relevant modules from the right technology vendors and outsourcing the hosting of data, as well as the support to the business units, will enable smaller treasuries to reach the next level of centralisation.</p>
<h4>Looking ahead, what do you see as the key themes for treasurers to concentrate on over the next 12-24 months?</h4>
<p>In Q4 2014, we conducted the Nordea Treasury 2017 report with the precise aim of taking the pulse of the industry. We surveyed 82 large corporate treasuries and interviewed more than 60 CFOs and treasurers, building a clear picture of where the treasury stands today, and how treasurers see their role evolving in the future.</p>
<p>The key findings reinforce much of what we’ve spoken about already, such as banking relationships being absolutely key, and the fact many treasurers are finding that a smaller number of core banks gives greater oversight of liquidity and exposure, without the counterparty risk of a single global bank model. Elsewhere, the survey found visibility and control over cash and liquidity remain significant priorities, with access to funding and optimising existing funding arrangements also high on the agenda. In addition, centralisation is widely recognised as ‘the future’: giving treasurers a better overview of their cash and liquidity positions, whilst also helping to deliver the efficiencies needed as treasuries take on an expanding workload and become strategic advisors to the business.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest change the survey results highlighted was the decline in trading activity undertaken by the treasury department over the last decade. Only a third of treasuries still have a trading mandate and, for them, the objective is usually to sustain market knowledge rather than to generate a profit.</p>
<p>Whilst trading may be declining, hedging is on the up. The survey results revealed large corporates are now hedging more risks than they were two to three years ago, and most expect they will be hedging even more by 2017. In particular, corporates are hedging to protect themselves against fluctuations in FX and interest rates, typically using futures. In summary, the Treasury 2017 report underlines that treasury has moved into a strategic role, but that is not to say the transactional element of the treasury’s role is going away – this remains just as important as ever.</p>
<h4>Looking at the transactional space for a moment then, how is innovation in the world of payments set to impact corporate treasurers and their payment providers?</h4>
<p>In its current form, ‘the payment’ is a standalone product for the transfer of funds to settle a transaction. And over the last decade, it has gradually turned into a low-priced commodity of little strategic interest. Due to the impact of new technology and regulatory changes, however, we can foresee a huge transformation in the role of a payment. In the future, the humble payment will become a value-adding solution that is integrated into broader commercial transactions. A key factor that will affect all stakeholders is the advent of the Payment Service Directive 2 (PSD2) as it will allow new non-bank players to enter the space. Of course, this could be seen as a threat by the banks, but the smart operators will use it as an opportunity; they can set themselves up (perhaps via subsidiary) as a non-bank and offer the same services to customers. So, this change should not be seen by banks as a threat but as a way of liberating them from some of the regulatory constraints they were subject to before.</p>
<p>And since banks already have the infrastructure, the compliance teams, and the knowledge of the industry, they are in a perfect place to better serve payments customers. Conversely, some of the new entrants will find that, as they expand, they encounter all the same regulations that banks now do – and they will struggle without the right resources and expertise. So, for smart banks, this could be the start of a new life. The PSD2 will focus the attention of the banks and they will have to build an appropriate response or, ultimately, face a bleak future.</p>
<h4>Another trend we are hearing a great deal about is digitisation. Why do treasurers need to be thinking about this?</h4>
<p>Digitisation is very much a hot topic. We foresee many innovative digital offerings entering the market with the potential to support the treasury function more efficiently than traditional bank services. For example, just as FX services have been made available in an auction format through portals that enable corporates to pick and choose who they want to deal with for a given transaction, in the future it may be possible for many other banking services to be consumed in this way, making the marketplace far more competitive.</p>
<p>Naturally, the banks will not sit idly by and watch while new entrants eat their proverbial lunch though, so we can expect greater innovation coming from the banks too. As discussed, the traditional payment offering will be redefined – it will also be further integrated with more comprehensive product propositions covering the customer´s process end-to-end. Treasurers should also expect to see banks making use of new technology to create multi-channel functionality based on real-time exchange of transactions and balances.</p>
<p>For the treasurer, the key messages around digitisation are to stay up-to-date and to be ready to exploit the new offerings. In a world of fast-shifting technology and rapid adoption of new digital solutions, it is important to be part of the flow. Simply waiting and seeing how it turns out is not likely to be a winning strategy, since you need to be in sync with your counterparties to stay efficient.</p>
<h4>Finally, how is Nordea embracing digital opportunities?</h4>
<p>In order to become very easy to deal with, whilst remaining relevant and reliable, Nordea is one of few banks in the world so far to embark on a simplification journey whereby the complete core banking and payment platforms are being replaced. This will enable Nordea to become highly efficient and agile, and at the same time to further embrace the digital opportunities ahead.</p>
<p>Nordea is also utilising new technologies to create innovative services and to establish omnichannel solutions which are more efficient in reaching and supporting our customers. We are increasing our spending on innovation and people working in a lab environment. We were one of the first banks to provide banking content for the Apple Watch and have many other interesting solutions cooking. The golden rule, and our ultimate goal, is to be available whenever, from wherever, and through whichever channel our customer chooses.</p>
<p>Beyond our own horizons, we believe digitisation is a key enabler for transforming the whole banking industry. Going forward, we will see traditional bank propriety solutions being replaced by more comprehensive offerings, whereby any given financial service will be closely integrated into broader commercial product propositions. XML will be the bedrock of much progress in this space, as long as it remains standardised, and Common Global Implementation will play a big role in keeping it as a true standard. And then we have blockchain technology which could transform banking fundamentally.</p>
<p>To be part of this digital evolution, banks will have to utilise the best of new technology and be willing to partner with other players when building and delivering new services. Another major component of this ongoing development is engagement with the customers; to ensure what the banks are working towards really taps in to their long-term ambitions. Digitisation is a primary strategic initiative and growing need on the customer side and banks must respond by facilitating discussions with their customers around the innovative use of digitisation. The payment execution is a central part of the commercial process but digitisation stretches far beyond that. Collaboration, for instance, could focus on potential cost reductions, efficiency enhancement, risk, reallocation of treasury staff from back office to more high-value front execution or even positioning treasury as a strategic business partner in the internal digital ambition.</p>
<p>We are increasingly assuming this role as a knowledge centre and strategic advisor where we facilitate the sharing of best practices, digital strategies and smarter ways of working between and together with our customers. This helps prepare treasurers for the next opportunities that digitisation will bring and arms them with relevant knowledge and viewpoints to carry into the C-suite. It is a new step in the customer-bank relationship and I would certainly encourage treasurers to proactively engage with their banking partners around digitisation and help shape the future of financial services and, indeed, drive the innovation agenda within their own organisations.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p><em>As a follow up to his article in the last edition of Treasury Today Asia, our treasury insider looks at four potential ways to strengthen the current fragile banking system, and considers their likely effectiveness.</em></p>
<p>The current regulatory approach is one in which I have little faith as a means to mend or even really change the financial system. So, what are the alternatives? Well, whilst there are doubtless other possible solutions, there are four interesting alternative views (spurred on by last issue’s article) that I’d like to explore here. Namely: Fintech will save the day; separate credit from money; revive Glass-Steagall and rolling sub debt.</p>
<h3 id="does-fintech-hold-the-answer">Does Fintech hold the answer?</h3>
<p>Clearly technology is having massive impacts on finance. From algorithmic and high speed trading to electronic and mobile payments; social investment, peer-to-peer lending and trading; private currencies; and more. Many of these technologies are impressive and appear to have the potential to disrupt banks and drive radical change. Peer-to-peer lending, for instance, shows great promise, as reflected in soaring IPOs of some firms. By cutting out the middle men (traditionally banks), they promise lower fees. By harnessing big data, they promise better credit assessment.</p>
<p>Three big questions remain: firstly, how will they survive the next downturn? Lenders are likely to lose their appetite when defaults mount. Secondly, how will they scale? Will these lenders be able to step in to replace conventional credit markets? And if so will they provide healthy liquidity? Finally, when they hit credit losses at scale, will they need to be bailed out like banks? If that happens, then we have just created new high tech banks with the same fragility that we face now.</p>
<p>These platforms currently appear to meet the criteria that both risks and rewards are private. Banks under the current moral hazard regime have private profits and social (eg tax payer) losses. If the new platforms become too big to fail, then we have not achieved sustainable finance. Similar problems face peer-to-peer trading – both retail and institutional. Traditional markets provided liquidity; this is already drying up under current regulations. Fintech platforms struggle even more without market makers. In many cases, Fintech is not really disrupting finance but simply building new channels to traditional markets. And it may not have the advantages that it boasts.</p>
<h3 id="separate-credit-from-money">Separate credit from money?</h3>
<p>Here, it’s important to explore the distinction between banks and banking. We have seen low tech shadow banking can quickly reach levels requiring government bailout. It is likely that Fintech will not just reach – but actively target – too big to fail. What business would forego privatised profits and socialised losses? One would be a fool to refuse a free lunch! The question though is not Fintech vs banks. The question is what to do about banking (whether performed by Wall Street, Silicon Valley, or any other player) which conflates money and credit to disastrous effect – driving leverage and moral hazard? New regulations will just push the banks themselves and their various non-bank competitors to find creative ways to build leverage again, to game the system, to force the next crisis and the next round of bailouts. What some industry commentators suggest is to separate money from credit. Money would remain government issued and controlled as a medium of exchange. Credit would be restricted by revising accounting rules.</p>
<p>As the authors of the book ‘The end of banking – money, credit and the digital revolution’ say: “The total value of financial assets of a company has to be less than or equal to the value of its equity. They explain that this reading highlights that companies have to back assets that are someone else’s liability with their own funds, that is, equity. Companies cannot finance credit with someone else’s credit.”</p>
<p>This would indeed solve the problem. It would also create wrenching change and radically reduce credit availability. Since we seem to be hooked on credit driven growth as a replacement for productivity driven growth, this could make the solution politically and socially unworkable.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote>Clearly technology is having massive impacts on finance.

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h3 id="revive-glass-steagall">Revive Glass-Steagall?</h3>
<p>Separating investment banking from commercial banking has been much discussed. Partial steps in this direction have been legislated – for instance the Volker rule in the US and ring-fencing in UK. The idea is to create ‘safe banks’ which would have deposit insurance and separate them from investment banks which would do the dangerous stuff without government support. The difficulty is in keeping safe banks safe. Safe banks used to pour deposits funds into housing. But the term ‘safe as houses’ seems laughable after the last crisis, which was largely one of housing leverage.</p>
<p>With all the technology available to banks now, keeping the separation intact will be difficult. So, as described above, the issue is probably more with banking than with specific banks. Separating money from credit (for all businesses whether they call themselves banks or not) is probably more robust than trying to segregate different types of banks. In any case, full reinstatement of Glass-Steagall would be a wrenching change for the economy and might be politically unworkable.</p>
<h3 id="rolling-sub-debt">Rolling sub debt?</h3>
<p>As described in my previous article, central bankers and others have proposed that banks be forced to issue substantial amounts of ten year rolling subordinated debt as a solution to financial fragility. The need to sell a material chunk of sub debt every year would focus management’s minds on their risk profile, and continuous market pricing of sub debt would provide a market view of the institution’s riskiness.</p>
<p>Of course, buyers of such rolling sub debt would want to understand the issuer’s business and risks. This would likely drive simplification, which is likely to take the form of downsizing (since size increases complexity) and specialisation (since universal banking is harder to understand). This might also provide economics for independent risk assessment, rather than the crazy conflict of interest built into today’s rating process.</p>
<p>Investors will demand reliable reporting from sub debt issuers, so this might provide impetus to clean up the current accounting standards mess which seems only to enrich advisors and confuse everyone else. Since transparency will equate with lower pricing, issuers have a strong incentive to be clear about their businesses.</p>
<p>As discussed previously, simple economics imply that banks will outspend and therefore out manoeuvre regulators. The beauty of the rolling sub debt concept is that it unleashes the markets to regulate the banks. Sub debt investors will be able to pay to keep on top of bank obfuscation, and thus to keep the banks honest. Dodgy banks will have a very high cost of capital. Markets are out of favour these days, but they are the most efficient method of capital allocation unless incentives are distortive. Pre-crisis politicians wanted more home ownership – markets delivered brilliantly.</p>
<p>The other advantage of rolling sub debt is that it allows the banks and the markets to figure by supply and demand how fast to adapt and in what direction. It is likely to be better to let banking evolve under market discipline rather than to ask regulators to decide what banking should look like. And since the markets will be left to determine how to reduce financial fragility (by deciding how to optimise risk and reward), the regulators will be freed to do a much simpler job – ensure honest reporting (and hopefully jail and bankrupt offenders).</p>
<p>Since it is not prescriptive on how, the rolling sub debt solution subsumes some of the others that I looked at above. We will find out from sub debt pricing whether investors prefer higher or lower tech banks, specialised investment banks separate from commercial banks, and so on. We may find some of the more inscrutable branches of finance go back to being partnerships, as was the norm in the past for investment private banking, because it is too hard to explain the business to investors. We might even end up in a situation from which the separation of credit from money becomes less jarring.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>There are many potential ways to reduce financial fragility. Since banks have more resources than regulators, regulation is unlikely to succeed because the banks will just find new ways to game the system. For now, of the options discussed in this article, forcing banks to issue material rolling ten year subordinated debt still looks like the most workable current alternative. It is a clean yet strong mechanism that imposes strict discipline on risk in banking without regulating micro behaviour. It allows the markets to find optimal solutions to this worrying financial fragility.</p>

<p>At a recent conference, the moderator closed a panel discussion on the future of transaction banking by asking for our thoughts on the future impact of the current regulatory tsunami. My answer: there is a structural asymmetry in bank regulation – bankers are paid more than regulators. Regulations essentially provide cover under which banks maximise their rents. When banks have finished the ‘cover your back’ part of compliance, they will start working on how to game the system, thereby sowing the seeds of the next banking crisis.</p>
<p>Is this just David having a rant against the banks, I hear you ask? Well, if so, I am in distinguished company. In fact, many of my closest friends are bankers and I have been working with bankers for 30 years. Bankers, like the rest of us, are subject to collective delusions, as the interesting research into many lost personal fortunes in the sub-prime debacle illustrates. Gillian Tett at the FT concluded: “it is groupthink and wishful thinking – not deliberate malevolence – that poses the biggest risk in finance.”</p>
<p>The root of our current fragile banking system lies in the conflicts of interest and distortive incentives that Western societies have created in the banks’ playing field. Our governments set the laws that define the rules of the game; bankers then go out and play their best. This is fair enough, if the rules align with societal needs. They do not.</p>
<p>In many ways, the global financial crisis was the result of banks responding enthusiastically to government incentives to increase home ownership. The policies that supported this supposed social good, and the institutions like Fanny Mae and Freddie Mac, were complemented by banks energetically slicing and dicing credit so that more risk could be absorbed. Of course, we have now seen that no amount of financial engineering can convert sub-prime into AAA – at least outside of the magical world of credit ratings.</p>
<h3 id="a-little-history">A little history</h3>
<p>It has not always been so. A multitude of metrics show that finance has grown enormously since the wave of deregulation in the 1980s. And the run of ever larger financial crises suggests that finance has grown out of control.</p>
<p>The FT’s Martin Wolf – interviewed by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) – made some interesting observations about the new normal: “The leverage we’re seeing now — 25 to one — is quite new. It’s not the way banks used to run in the UK and the US, which I know best, 60, 70, 80 years ago. They used to have leverage of, at most, ten to one, often even just five to one. So, moving to such extreme leverage as we see today, where the sound institutions have leverage of around 20 to one, is actually relatively new. Having such undercapitalised banks, in my view, is one of the reasons why they give us so little in terms of growth and development.”</p>
<p>Finance pay which ran around 100% of US average pay post war through the 1980s, has since blown out to 180% – nearly doubling – according to Simon Johnson in The Atlantic. Finance’s share of GDP quadrupled from 2% to 8% in the same period, according to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis. And it is the same story with finance’s share of stock market values and share of profits.</p></div>

<p>Some bankers would probably argue, and perhaps even believe, that these global and function-spanning masters of the universe with their hair raising leverage are contributing to a more efficient world; and that their generous salaries pale in comparison with the social good they generate. The data suggests the opposite. Not only are banks skimming off more and more value, they are doing it to the detriment of the real economy.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote>Research by economist Thomas Philippon at New York University shows that the cost of financial intermediation has risen from 2% to 9% over the last century. For context, retail and wholesale trade have both shrunk by about 20% in this period, on the back of the same lower costs and rising efficiency that is available to the financial sector.</blockquote>

<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Even more worrying is the extensive evidence that banks are not adding value to society, but on the contrary, are taking value out – extracting higher and increasing the cost of financial intermediation. As Martin Wolf told BCG: “If you look at what the banks have been doing, they’ve predominantly been lending to leverage up property assets. Most of it has been collateralised by property, mortgages of various kinds. They have been doing very little lending to small and medium-sized enterprises, while the big corporates are all dependent on the bond market. So, actually, the link between bank lending and growth has become incredibly weak.”</p>
<p>Indeed, US Bureau of Economic Analysis data shows that the growth of bank profits is a mirror image of the decline of manufacturing profits – the banks have been eating the real economy’s lunch!</p>
<p>And that’s not all. Research by economist Thomas Philippon at New York University shows that the cost of financial intermediation has risen from 2% to 9% over the last century. For context, retail and wholesale trade have both shrunk by about 20% in this period, on the back of the same lower costs and rising efficiency that is available to the financial sector.</p>
<p>Philippon concludes that ‘financialisation’ has been a disservice to society: “According to this measure, the finance industry that sustained the expansion of railroads, steel and chemical industries, and the electricity and automobile revolutions was more efficient than the current finance industry.”</p>
<h3 id="next-steps">Next steps</h3>
<p>If you accept my two main points so far (that bankers will end up gaming the post-crisis banking regulatory system because they structurally have more firepower than regulators, and that globe-spanning universal banks are draining value from the real economy) then you will want to know what can be done to improve the situation.</p>
<p>The answer, in a nutshell, is “not much” – now that Wall Street’s regulatory capture of Washington (and the equivalent on the other side of the Atlantic) has essentially set the rules for the current cycle. The key rule is that moral hazard is preserved. This means that banks are empowered to exploit the privatisation of profits backed by the socialisation of losses in the “too big to fail” sector.</p>
<p>Adding fuel to the fire, the complexity and newness of the latest wave of regulation gives bankers a massive playground of obfuscation in which they can confuse customers and shareholders alike to maximise their rents. They will be smart enough not to repeat the error of the banker who said of Basel III: “The client doesn’t want to do simple calculations because treasuries are full of morons.”</p>
<p>My conclusion is that we will probably need another derailing to stop this train. And it might not be too long coming.</p>
<h3 id="whats-the-alternative">What’s the alternative?</h3>
<p>Clearly something had to be done in response to the global financial crisis. Even if we accept that some of the problems, such as sub-prime and excess leverage in real estate, were politically driven, the crisis clearly showed the fragility of the banks. But rather than ever more complex regulation, and the inevitable collateral damage and unintended consequences of it, we might have tried structural reform.</p>
<p>Re-enforcing the separation of investment and commercial banking that was shattered by the repeal of Glass-Steagall in the 1980s was proposed by many eminent observers and experienced regulators. But, apart from limited take up of the Vickers report in Britain, the banks managed to quash the idea. In fact, the American solution to the systemic risk posed by Goldman-Sachs (previously a pure investment bank) was to inject a dose of heart-warming moral hazard by turning it into a bank holding company!</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Given the plethora of data I have referenced above, I doubt the bankers’ claims that universal banking brings scale economies that benefit the real economy. My personal experience has been that Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) and commercial bankers barely talk to each other within the same institution. That inclines me to believe that “too big to fail” is more like “too big to manage,” as concluded by the St Louis Fed and more recently by HSBC’s CEO.</p>
<p>Still, we have to assume – either because size brings benefits we have failed to discern or simply because of the depth of regulatory capture – that banks will not be broken up.</p>
<h3 id="market-discipline">Market discipline</h3>
<p>An intriguing idea surfaced in the immediate aftermath of the crisis. It was proposed mainly by central bankers, and I waited eagerly for the ensuing media discussion (it never happened). The common theme was to let the markets police the banks. Hedge funds and investment houses have the budget to hire bankers and physicists to keep up with the banks. So force banks to issue some fairly unpalatable funding, and the pricing of that will enforce market discipline on them.</p>
<p>William Poole (ex-President of the St Louis Fed) made a very clean suggestion in the FT in 2009: force banks, as a condition of their licence, to issue ten-year rolling subordinated debt amounting to 10% of their assets. The ten-year rolling part ensures continuity of assessment. The subordinated part ensures that investors will have serious skin in the bank game. And the 10% of assets keeps it material. Incidentally, Julie Dickson (Canada’s superintendent of financial institutions) also suggested sub debt and using market discipline to police the banks in the FT in 2010.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote>Corporate treasurers are often cited as a strong use case for global banks. But the truth is that no bank really spans the globe, so we have to multi-bank already. And megabanks are not as seamlessly integrated as their marketing departments would have us believe. As such, using a number of smaller banks is not so scary for corporates.</blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source"></p>

<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Although William Poole was structurally astute in his suggestion, he definitely got the regulatory psychology wrong when he concluded his letter with this optimism: “A return to the status quo ante, with banks enjoying the benefits of ‘too big to fail’, does not seem likely. Regulators will not dare risk a repeat performance. Bankers who think that their political influence will control the regulatory process are in for a rude surprise.”</p>
<p>I fear the bankers got the last laugh – at least for this cycle. Obviously, transparency is a prerequisite for market discipline. The markets cannot police the banks if the banks are not transparent. Bankers, whose primary profit centre is customer ignorance, detest transparency, and are endlessly creative about the benefits of opacity.</p>
<p>So, strict enforcement of accounting clarity (which I realise is not easy) will be needed. This will be coupled with pressure that will come from investors to disclose meaningful information about derivative and cash exposures, so that they can assess the risks. In the end, investors will not buy sub debt of a bank they cannot understand. So market discipline will likely succeed in shrinking and simplifying the banks where regulation has failed.</p>
<p>According to the St Louis Fed, “Most, if not all, of the megabanks would have failed without government support during the financial crisis. In other words, in a truly free market, most or all of those banks would have exited.”</p>
<h3 id="what-does-this-mean-for-treasurers">What does this mean for treasurers?</h3>
<p>Corporate treasurers are often cited as a strong use case for global banks. But the truth is that no bank really spans the globe, so we have to multi-bank already. And megabanks are not as seamlessly integrated as their marketing departments would have us believe. As such, using a number of smaller banks is not so scary for corporates. SWIFT and other providers can connect us to multiple banks.</p>
<p>Ripple provides an exciting model for even more seamless finance in the future. And we would benefit from banks collaborating more rather than aiming for world domination. So, for those treasurers with the bandwidth to look beyond the current regulatory tsunami and the possibility that it could trigger the next banking crisis, planning for a more heterogeneous banking ecosystem might be one for the to-do list.</p>

<h3 id="optimising-collections">Optimising collections</h3>
<p>Collections are intrinsically harder than payments. When you pay, you know what you are paying and you control when you pay. (If not, you won’t keep your job for very long!) For most of us, it is much harder to know when customers will pay and what exactly they are paying.</p>
<p>This is why there are a lot of reconciliation services from software vendors and banks. The situation is complicated by variations in national clearing systems and business practices. Although sometimes painful to set up, things like boletos in Brazil and payment references in Finland can greatly speed collection reconciliation. In other countries, short or non-existent reference fields in payments hamper reconciliation.</p>
<p>Best practice in auto-reconciliation of commercial collections is in the high 90% range. For treasury flows, it is easy to get close to 100% auto-reconciliation, because treasury transactions are usually low volume and high value and strictly value dated. Many treasury centres combine standard settlement instructions (SSIs) with formal net settlement arrangements, and further reduce cost and risk with CLS (Continuous Linked Settlement).</p>
<p>For timing, many studies have shown that the majority of payment delays come from invoice errors. The logical way to reduce these is to embrace straight through processing (STP) in order to cash (O2C) as well with e-invoicing, and encourage customers to do likewise. E-invoices do not get lost, do not get miscoded by manual operators, and therefore get paid promptly.</p>
<h3 id="inter-company">Inter-company</h3>
<p>Inter-company flows are necessary, but offer zero value added. So it is incumbent on treasurers to settle and reconcile them quickly, safely, and cheaply. The tools of choice for this are netting and in house bank (IHB).</p>
<p>Netting (multilateral inter-company netting) nets off the flows between subsidiaries, across currencies and across multiple subsidiaries, so that each subsidiary has only one net flow in its home currency per month. This saves float, foreign exchange spreads, and payment fees. An IHB nets off inter-company balances – simply put, all inter-company flows are booked to an IHB multi-currency account, and the resulting home currency balance can be settled or funded monthly or on some other frequency. The end result from a flow perspective is similar to netting, and an IHB also has balance implications.</p>
<p>The choice of netting vs an IHB is beyond the scope of this article. The key point from a flow perspective is that both eliminate inter-company flows through the banking system and the associated costs and risks. Furthermore, both techniques practically eliminate inter-company reconciliation issues, which also reduces costs and risks still further.</p>
<h3 id="balances">Balances</h3>
<p>Balances present a different series of problems including visibility, availability, credit and other risks.</p>
<p>Visibility is knowing how much cash you have and where it is. Availability is having access to use your cash when needed. The risks are what might reduce the value of your cash.</p>
<p>The context is critical here. Balances cannot be optimised without clarity about the desired balance sheet structure, and especially things like leverage and cash levels. From a cost perspective, zero is the ideal cash level, but for most people the resulting liquidity risk would be uncomfortable. From a risk perspective, we would all like to have $150 billion in cash, but the cost – currently zero interest income minus weighted average cost of capital (WACC) – is prohibitive for most. You cannot define optimal cash management without clarity on this.</p>
<p>In these days of exceptional corporate cash – some $5 trillion between US and EU multinationals – it appears that corporates are holding cash to mitigate fear uncertainty and doubt about the macro economic outlook and market liquidity. Since there is no financial formula to justify such high cash balances, the solution has been to segment cash into operating cash (with a policy formula and high availability) and strategic cash (with no strict formula and potentially longer tenor).</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote>Cash visibility is a cornerstone of effective balance management. If you do not know how much cash you have and where it is, you cannot manage it.</blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source"></p>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><h3 id="visibility">Visibility</h3>
<p>Cash visibility is a cornerstone of effective balance management. If you do not know how much cash you have and where it is, you cannot manage it.</p>
<p>Visibility is normally defined as ‘What percentage of my cash do I see next morning?’ Best practice on this metric is close to 100%. The denominator for this calculation should reconcile with cash reported in the financial statements. Some organisations look at percentage of accounts, but the amount of cash is ultimately more important, and small, difficult to report accounts may be a distraction.</p>
<p>Visibility is normally achieved through some kind of e-banking. If you have more than one bank, you will want multi-bank connectivity. This can be achieved through SWIFT, third-party services, or a bank offering multi-bank connectivity. The goal is to collect closing balances overnight, so that all interested parties can see the transactions (for reconciliation) and balances (for management) in the morning. Sometimes, the data is gathered internally by asking subsidiaries to input their own banks, but this takes time, is error prone, and is normally done weekly. At the opposite extreme, some corporates request real-time reporting, or multiple intraday updates, especially to be able to reconcile and process commercial collections as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Visibility in the best cases is complemented by forecasting. Just to avoid confusion, cash visibility and cash forecasting are different if related things. Cash visibility forms the starting point for cash positioning or short-term cash forecasting, but visibility is historic (last night) whereas forecasting is about the future.</p>
<h3 id="availability">Availability</h3>
<p>When you have visibility over your cash, the next step is to have control over it. Availability can be limited by issues like rights and connectivity to tax and regulation.</p>
<p>If the cash balance is in a joint venture, treasury may not have the right to deploy the money as it wishes. In extreme cases, recalcitrant subsidiaries may refuse to report balances. “Cash belongs to treasury” is an excellent motto I heard from one corporate.</p>
<p>With the right to the cash clarified, you need to establish connectivity and access rights to the bank so that you can move the money when needed. In the majority of countries, e-banking and SWIFT connectivity are available. Good practice in this respect is to make SWIFT capability a pre-condition for any cash management bank.</p>
<p>Any cross-border flow has tax consequences. When you move money from subsidiary to treasury, you need to know the tax implications, and whether they are acceptable or not. For example, many US corporates have the right and the connectivity to their cash abroad, but the cash remains trapped there by Subpart-F, costing 30% to repatriate. Hence the mountains of cash in their financial statements, coupled with apparently contradictory domestic bond issues to pay share buybacks. Regulation can also trap cash. Many emerging markets require documentation plus professional certification, plus government sign-off, before money can leave the country. In extreme cases, the central bank may not have enough hard currency to fund the payment.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, it is critical to segment visible cash into cash that is available and cash that is not. Preferably, you will have some understanding of how to make the unavailable cash become available, and how long that might take. For clarity, available cash + trapped cash = total cash. It is good practice to measure and track available cash as a percentage of total cash, but benchmarking against other corporates is difficult since trapped cash issues are highly contextual.</p>
<h3 id="risk">Risk</h3>
<p>If you are lucky enough to have cash, you do not want to lose it and you want it available when needed. Short-term cash is normally invested to ensure security, liquidity, and yield – aka SLY. Note that yield is the last priority. The main risks to cash include counterparty credit risk, sovereign risk, FX risk and interest rate risk.</p>
<p>Counterparty credit risk is the main risk treasurers think of when dealing with cash. The most common metric used is agency ratings from Standard &amp; Poor’s (S&amp;P), Moody’s and Fitch, despite their role in the global financial crisis. Best practice augments agency ratings with implied ratings, credit default swap rates, equity data, balance sheet analysis, and other metrics. When measuring counterparty credit risk, it is important to remember that risk comes not only from cash and deposits but also from letters of credit (LCs), derivatives, etc.</p>
<p>Sovereign risk is the risk alluded to above that either a country changes its regulations so that you cannot get cash out anymore (for example by imposing exchange controls) or the central bank does not have hard currency to pay out.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange (FX) risk is – broadly speaking – the risk of loss from depreciation of a currency in which cash is held. FX risk management is beyond the scope of this article, but clearly cash (and cash investments) must be considered in your FX risk management. It is also important to ensure clarity about the base currency for risk measurement and the relative importance of cash flow and accounting risk.</p>
<p>Interest rate (IR) risk is the risk of loss from changes in interest rates along the yield curve. IR risk management is beyond the scope of this article, but it is critical to have clarity on the benchmark duration of cash (and its different segments if applicable). Since most corporate balance sheets are not easily converted into duration, the benchmark duration(s) will normally be set by policy rather than by formula.</p>
<h3 id="cash-pooling">Cash pooling</h3>
<p>Cash pooling is a popular aid to balance management. The main tools used are notional pooling, sweeping, and an IHB. These tools can be combined in various ways. In a sense, the baseline would be manual inter-company loans from and to treasury; sweeping and an IHB essentially automate this but do not change the tax issues; notional pooling both automates the inter-company balance management and eliminates the tax issues arising with inter-company balances.</p>
<p>Notional pooling is an agreement whereby the bank offsets negative and positive balances to eliminate interest spread. No cash moves and the balances remain bank balances not inter-company balances, which takes away all the tax problems that come with intercompany lending. Best practice is multi-currency multi-entity notional pooling.</p>
<p>Notional pooling gets a lot of bad press because most banks struggle with the technical and regulatory challenges it poses for them. Whatever difficulties banks have with notional pooling, these do not diminish the considerable benefits for corporates. If your bank is trying to persuade you to do sweeping rather than notional pooling, I recommend you talk to a specialist – like Bank Mendes Gans.</p>
<p>Sweeping (also called ZBA) involves transferring balances to a designated master account. Interest spread is eliminated as with notional pooling. The big difference is that the balances move from being bank balances to inter-company balances. Inter-company balances attract a host of tax problems including withholding tax, debt to equity limits (‘thin cap’), transfer pricing, and so on. Essentially, sweeping is outsourcing to banks the transfers that treasurers could otherwise do manually (or with in-house (IHB) systems). An IHB structure, like sweeping, concentrates cash at the IHB, resulting in intercompany balances. It is the most common in house alternative to bank sweeping services. An IHB can be combined with notional pooling.</p>
<p>Sweeping in general can be used to automatically transfer cash from operating and non-core accounts into pool accounts and the IHB. Cash concentration (like cash pooling without debit balances) can complement pooling and an IHB to widen the reach of balance management.</p>
<p>Cash pooling brings many important benefits including increasing the real availability of cash, eliminating interest spread paid to banks, reducing investment risk, increasing investment yield and reducing FX risk (multi-currency notional pools only).</p>
<p>The target is to have all available cash in one place at end of day (even if it is then invested in different ways to avoid concentration risk). Trapped cash by definition cannot be brought into cash pools and IHBs, but onshore cash pooling is often possible.</p>
<h3 id="technology">Technology</h3>
<p>It is not good practice to try to accomplish your cash management on paper, and terrible practice to do it with Excel. Excel is a wonderful tool for playing with numbers, and it is a disaster for ongoing critical operational processes – no access control, no audit trail, error prone manual work. Good practice is a properly implemented TMS with multi-bank connectivity, with security, access control, audit trail, and preferably delivered over the web or intranet.</p>
<p>TMS selection is also beyond the scope of this article, but it is worth mentioning that the kind of functionality described here need not be expensive or complicated to implement. SaaS vendors often provide SWIFT connectivity built in and offer competitive pricing per user per module. Some banks offer white labelled solutions or partner with TMS vendors to facilitate this functionality for their customers.</p>
<h3 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h3>
<p>It is not possible to say precisely what best practice in cash management is because different corporations will have different needs. Nevertheless, I hope this article helps to clarify some of the desirable practices that can help lead towards best practice for your organisation, as well as some of the bad practices to be avoided.</p>

<h4 id="opportunities-for-the-uk-trade-market-in-2015">What opportunities do you see for the UK trade market in 2015? How do these translate into your client activities?</h4>
<div class="person n1">
<p><strong>KT:</strong> Closing the UK trade deficit will be a key consideration in 2015, not only to rebalance the UK economy, but also to pave the way for growth – so getting companies exporting is a real opportunity for the UK and for businesses of all sizes in 2015. In fact, exporting has been proven to bring companies fresh ideas, innovation, new revenue streams, improved profile and credibility. Yet, only 20% of UK SMEs currently export.</p>
<p>At Barclays, we want to support companies to take the leap into new export markets, or to export for the first time. As such, we are actively encouraging clients – via roadshows and meetings, as well as partnerships with organisations such as UKTI and UKEF – to have confidence in the strength that ‘Brand Britain’ provides. British products and services are still considered very high quality and remain in demand, so there’s an enormous amount of potential out there for UK Plcs.</p>
<p>Another area where we are challenging clients’ exporting perceptions is around access to finance. While this is still difficult for some, we often find that clients do not always fully explore the opportunities on offer. So, in an environment of low interest rates and high liquidity, we encourage clients to leverage the expertise and business investment of banks like Barclays who are actively looking to innovate through their products and services.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="which-sectors-within-the-uk-economy-are-poised-for-overseas-growth-this-year">Which sectors within the UK economy are poised for overseas growth this year?</h4>
<div class="person n1">
<p><strong>KT:</strong> The opportunities are numerous – ranging from the manufacturing, engineering, creative and service industries to food and drink. These are all examples of sectors that are well placed with strong reputations and brands that can stretch into new markets, but, regardless of sector, I would say that all companies looking for export-led growth must focus on their technology. For those entering new markets, technology, even in the form of a web presence, offers a lower risk and lower cost entry point than bricks and mortar.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="what-about-the-geographical-challenges-and-opportunities-faced-by-uk-exporters">What about the geographical challenges and opportunities faced by UK exporters?</h4>
<div class="person n1">
<p><strong>KT:</strong> With the Eurozone forecast for lower growth in 2015, and broadly half of UK exports destined for the European market, we are encouraging UK companies to consider exporting to higher growth markets, such as Africa, Asia and emerging Europe. Of course, some of those markets carry different political risks – and geopolitical uncertainty is a worry for exporters at the moment.</p>
<p>Also of concern are currency movements. We saw a strengthening of sterling across last year, and any further appreciation will be both positive and negative: it will cheapen imports; but for those companies looking at an export-based growth strategy, it will naturally affect competitiveness. That said, these concerns are not new – they are age-old exporting challenges – and it is the role of banks like Barclays is to support clients in mitigating these risks.</p>
<p>That means providing our clients with protection when trading overseas, helping them to generate liquidity, and to improve cash flow or to innovate on their balance sheets. Since Barclays is well equipped to do this, we believe there is more opportunity than challenge in exporting.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="why-is-barclays-so-well-equipped-in-the-trade-space">Why is Barclays so ‘well equipped’ in the trade space? What differentiates you from the competition?</h4>
<div class="person n1">
<p><strong>KT:</strong> From a UK perspective, we have a 325 year history that we’re extremely proud of. It’s a history of supporting clients’ growth both domestically and internationally through the provision of trade solutions. That enables us to lean on the vast experience of working closely with clients and listening to them in order to ensure that the solutions we are providing today are the most appropriate to support their trade and working capital requirements.</p>
<p>Take our recent decision to join our Trade and Working Capital departments together in the bank, for instance. In order to better serve our clients, we have combined our trade finance teams with (historically separate) receivables financing specialists for trade and working capital. As a result, we have been able to extend our geographic footprint within the UK, whilst deepening our product set in a way that means we can deliver broader solutions, to more clients, more efficiently.</p>
<p>We’ve also recently brought together our business and corporate banking under one roof, so that we now have one team in the UK fulfilling client needs for businesses of all sizes. And while that might sound quite simple, it is really effective as it ensures that we can enable client growth by seamlessly providing specialist products and services aligned to clients needs’ as they evolve and grow through the continuum.</p>
<p>By the same token, we recognise that SME clients will always need a different level of support and service to the corporate marketplace, so we have 250 Trade and Working Capital specialists partnering with our relationship directors to service all of those segments appropriately. Going forward, it is our ability to leverage the scale and breadth of the Barclays group and our willingness to innovate, not just our trade and working capital expertise, which will set us apart.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="can-you-talk-through-some-of-the-recent-innovations-that-you-have-made">Can you talk through some of the recent innovations that you have made?</h4>
<div class="person n1">
<p><strong>KT:</strong> We already have a great product range, so we can service any trade need, but a current example of a new market-leading product, that is not available anywhere else, is the Barclays Advanced Overdraft. This is a technology-based solution which is working capital directed. It offers higher levels of funding than a traditional overdraft but doesn’t have the sometimes perceived, or actual, onerous administration that goes with an invoice discounting facility. So, clients get the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>Technology is a key focus for Barclays and will continue to be pivotal in proposition and service development. By the end of Q1 2015, we will have launched our new trade operating system which is designed to improve efficiency, transparency, accessibility and connectivity for clients to the Barclays global trade network. This represents a significant investment which signifies the level of ambition that Barclays has to grow our Trade business. It is designed to improve efficiency, transparency, accessibility, and connectivity for clients to the Barclays global trade network. That is an immense investment that has been developed over years, which is a huge step forward for Barclays and our clients.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="how-do-the-banks-uk-and-international-trade-propositions-dovetail">How do the bank’s UK and international trade propositions dovetail?</h4>
<div class="person n1">
<p><strong>KT:</strong> The way in which we bring together our UK expertise with our international capabilities is certainly a differentiator. Barclays is very well-equipped to support clients to grow internationally, whether that is from a UK base or otherwise. We are one of the largest players in the UK market, we already have 7,000 clients within the trade and working capital solutions area and we have the scale and reach to support any client, across any segment in the UK, with a fantastic range of products. Furthermore, our track record of financing UK exports – from the smallest of transactions to some of the largest facilities ever financed – speaks volumes of our commitment across the marketplace.</p>
<p>Looking internationally, our support for UK clients to step into overseas markets takes the form of specialist trade teams based across all the major European markets. We’re also exceptionally strong in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, not forgetting our presence in New York. We readily share our understanding of these markets with our clients – and this, combined with our in-country expertise and direct financial support, is what clients need to feel comfortable when trading overseas.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="the-international-trade-boutique">The International Trade Boutique</h3>
<h4 id="barclays-has-been-restructuring-in-the-last-year">Barclays has been restructuring in the last year. How has this impacted the way that the International Trade team will be servicing clients going forward?</h4>
<div class="person n2">
<p><strong>BB:</strong> In May last year, our Chief Executive, Antony Jenkins, announced Barclays’ Strategy for the coming years. Within the Corporate Bank our International Trade &amp; Working Capital products are key to the strategy. We are focusing on regions and products where we have competitive advantage. At the heart of our strategy is a focus on our people and building up the new digital bank. Overall, we will focus on providing high-value add solutions-based approach: what we call the ‘boutique’ model.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="what-exactly-do-you-mean-by-boutique-model">What exactly do you mean by ‘boutique’ model? And how will clients benefit?</h4>
<div class="person n2">
<p><strong>BB:</strong> A boutique model means having a high-quality tailored product proposition with a very clear core strategic client focus. It’s about being best-in-class in the types of products that we want to offer in our chosen markets, and only offering them to a selected number of clients – rather than trying to be a bank for every product in every market for any client. In summary: being relevant to our clients where they need our expertise with focus on excellent execution.</p>
<p>We actually piloted this model in our US business in 2014, as well as in Spain, with great success. What the pilot confirmed is that the large corporate clients, who already have plenty of banks, now want a partner. Barclays’ boutique approach means that our International Trade team becomes part of the decision-making process inside the client’s organisation by helping to provide a large strategic solution, rather than just offering an LC confirmation, for example.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="could-you-give-any-examples-of-this-in-practice">Could you give any examples of this in practice, and how your approach differentiates Barclays’ trade team from others in the market?</h4>
<div class="person n2">
<p><strong>BB:</strong> A good example of this is our recent work with the American subsidiary of an Indian group, looking for a cross-border receivables solution. When we approached this relationship, we took the time to identify the real opportunity, rather than just trying to shoehorn in a solution adapted to our risk appetite on the transaction. As such, we set out to discover what the real client needs were – and we leveraged with the interaction between our Indian investment and corporate banking colleagues, as well as our US and UK investment banking colleagues, to achieve this.</p>
<p>We came up with a solution that fits the entire spectrum of the client’s needs by syndicating the transaction internationally on the client’s behalf. So by inviting other banks to join, Barclays was able to present the client with a very efficient end-to-end solution.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="when-will-the-new-model-roll-out-to-other-geographies">When will the new model roll out to other geographies?</h4>
<div class="person n2">
<p><strong>BB:</strong> Although we don’t expect the transformation to be fully complete this year, we are making rapid progress. Spain and the US are already complete, and we will be rolling out the rest of Europe during the course of 2015. Work is also in progress in Asia Pacific and the Middle East.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="what-client-type-is-the-boutique-approach-best-suited-to">What client type is the boutique approach best suited to, in your view?</h4>
<div class="person n2">
<p><strong>BB:</strong> Our ambition is to be recognised in the market as a leading transaction bank, offering boutique-style servicing not only for our existing clients, but for key new clients, too. At Barclays Corporate Banking, we are focussed on four key client segments: Global Corporates, Financial Institutions, UK Corporates (from SMEs up to the FTSE100) and Africa Corporates (of all sizes). From a trade perspective, Barclays has a global presence and have our strongest product capabilities in EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa).</p>
</div>
<h4 id="where-do-you-see-the-biggest-growth-opportunities-for-your-team">Where do you see the biggest growth opportunities for your team, given this new structure?</h4>
<div class="person n2">
<p><strong>BB:</strong> I would position the Americas business as the number one growth area for us. As I mentioned, we piloted the trade boutique last year in the US and we have had big success stories over there, where we were able not only to land interesting deals, but to also become lead arrangers for some major deals in both Q4 2014 and Q1 2015. These will soon be announced in the press.</p>
<p>While we are already large in Africa, it has also been one of our strongest growth areas. We recently hired a team in Lagos to ensure we had on-the-ground trade expertise in Africa’s largest economy Nigeria.</p>
<p>We had a super year in Asia in 2014, and I hope to consolidate and build on what we achieved last year across the region.</p>
<p>Despite the low economic growth predictions for 2015, Continental Europe remains the third priority for my team as we still need to finish up the implementation of our boutique model in Europe. We’re extremely excited about rolling this out to clients and we look forward to establishing even deeper partnerships with our existing, and new, clients over the coming months to years.</p>

<p>Cash management exists in a context; therefore optimising cash management must be contextual. The context is the business and its risk profile, as well as management’s risk appetite.</p>
<p>My working assumption is that the goal of treasury is cost effective risk reduction (CERR). Most of us want to reduce costs, especially since treasury is non-core to corporates. Likewise, we want to reduce treasury risks – but crucially not at any cost. No risk equals no reward. Nevertheless, we want to reduce treasury risks to maximise the risk capacity that can be deployed in the core business.</p>
<p>Treasury can only optimise CERR, and by extension cash management, if the risk profile is clear and agreed by management. This is not rocket science, just simple things like: how much cash should we hold? What is acceptable leverage? And so on.</p>
<h3 id="cash-management">Cash management</h3>
<p>At its core, cash management comprises flows and balances. Flows are about moving money into, out of, and around the business – payments, collections, and intercompany settlements. Balances are what end up on different bank accounts around the business.</p>
<p>Optimising flows is primarily about cost reduction and managing operational risks. Optimising balances may require more work on the CERR balance. For example, to one business, zero-balancing subsidiaries may seem cost effective; to another it might seem too risky.</p>
<h3 id="managing-flows">Managing flows</h3>
<p>The key to efficient flow management is to minimise both the internal and the external costs. This requires efficient processes – for example manual processing is expensive both internally and externally at banks – so straight through processing (STP) must be the goal. And the wider the STP, the higher the efficiency. Happily, STP is a no brainer from a CERR perspective, since STP reduces costs and risks (humans are expensive and error prone).</p>
<p>STP is often understood simply to mean ‘avoiding manual repair of payments by banks’. My meaning is much wider. I mean STP throughout the purchase-to-pay (P2P) and order-to-cash (O2C) processes. In direct procurement, the purchase decision can be made by the material requirements planning (MRP) software directly without manual intervention. In indirect procurement, procurement workflow can capture initial request, management approval, delivery, and then automate invoice matching and payment when due. In O2C, where customers order electronically, the workflow can be fully automated through to reconciliation of collected cash.</p>
<p>I hope it will be clear that best practice goes far beyond the treasury department and the banks. Best practice involves optimising CERR holistically across business processes. This is not ‘pie in the sky’ either – I know plenty of corporates that operate as described above, and have neither (particularly) simple, nor purely virtual, businesses.</p>
<p>That said, the integration described above may not suit all businesses or may not be accessible to all treasuries. There are a wide variety of solutions between writing cheques and full electronic integration that can suit diverse corporate needs.</p>
<h3 id="optimising-payments">Optimising payments</h3>
<p>Here are some more specific observations that flow from the above.</p>
<p>Approving payments is nonsense. It is too late anyway. The moment for key controls is when the legal obligation is created – for example, a purchase order (PO) for commercial transactions and entering into a deal for treasury transactions. If the purchase was legally valid and the seller has delivered as contracted, withholding payment will only lead to court.</p>
<p>And if the payment approval is intended to verify that the seller’s banking information is correct, then manual approval is a lousy way to check this kind of data. It’s time to get a decent ERP and TMS, and secure them correctly. The key control points here are changes to the vendor master data (especially banking details – or, for treasury, the SSIs standing settlement instructions) and initial contracting (POs for commercial transactions and deals for treasury transactions).</p>
<p>Depressingly, I frequently hear things like “But my FD likes to sign the telegraphic transfer form.” In any material business, the FD or CFO cannot possibly know the details of every payment, and signing payments cannot be a productive use of senior management time. Furthermore, despite all the current excitement about spying and data security, paper is – by any reasonable measure – a much more dangerous medium than electronic. In short, this predilection massively increases CERR by raising costs and pumping up risks.</p>
<p>Since the PO is the critical legal document of the business’ obligation, it makes sense to pin the P2P process to it. Many CFOs have the mantra of “No PO, no pay”, in other words if an invoice comes in without the PO number on it, it is returned to sender forthwith. With that number connecting PO, delivery, and invoice, it becomes easy to build efficient P2P processes that are both safe and cheap.</p>
<p>On the external cost side of payments, best practice includes ensuring lowest-cost routing, which generally means making payments locally. This in turn implies paying on behalf of (OBO) – ie treasury (or SSC) has accounts in each country so that it can make payments locally on behalf of subsidiaries anywhere in the world. Of course, it is also good practice to code payment instructions in your ERP and TMS so that they avoid manual repair at banks.</p>
<p>Best practice in OBO is when subsidiaries have no bank account at all. Many multinationals have consolidated all payments and collections to IHB (or payment factory), in other words 100% of flows are handled through IHB accounts on behalf of subsidiaries so the subsidiaries have no bank accounts at all. This results in one bank account per country owned by IHB.</p>
<p>Note that none of the above is about squeezing service providers and banks – it is about improving internal processes. None the less, there is no point in paying more than necessary for payments. As a guideline, local low value payments should be free or cents, and international payments should be $5-10. Percentage based fees are not acceptable, especially since they normally have minimum floors. Market practice is not a justification for abusively high fees. There should be no float or compensating balances (unless you have transparency over pricing and are able to calculate the benefit precisely).</p>

<p>As an early impetus, payment factories (which centralise payment processing), gained from the spread of shared service centres (SSCs). These SSCs sought to improve control in response to Sarbanes-Oxley through standardised processes and contain costs in response to increasing competition through economies of scale, taking advantage of the opportunities for centralisation offered by the internet.</p>
<p>Once accounts payable (AP) was centralised to an SSC, it made sense to handle the payments there as well. Since SSCs tend to run on a single-instance ERP, payment factories are a large, secure pipe connecting the ERP to banks – typically via SWIFT.</p>
<p>The benefits of SSCs in terms of control and costs continue to be attractive, which is why the SSC bandwagon is still rolling on strongly over a decade after the initial boom. More and more operational back office-type processes, that can often be considered hygiene rather than core, are put into SSCs. The objective is to free the customer-facing teams from routine administration so that they can focus on the core business.</p>
<p>However, the high-volume pipe connecting the ERP to banks is not the only argument for payment factories. And not all groups want a centralised model, nor is it suitable for all businesses. Examples include conglomerates spanning different businesses with divergent operational needs, and groups that comprise individual businesses that need to remain independent for various reasons, as well as groups (often in regulated industries) that expand through joint ventures where, lacking control, they cannot avail themselves of SSCs.</p>
<p>Even without the centralisation and standardised processes implied in SSCs, there is a strong case for payment factories to enhance control and reduce costs through economies of scale and efficient payment routing.</p>
<h3 id="payment-factory-mass-customisation">Payment factory mass customisation</h3>
<p>When a group, for one reason or another, does not want to go down the route of centralisation and SSC, how can they benefit from payment factory technology?</p>
<p>For treasurers who do not want to interfere with their subsidiaries’ operating processes, one model might be simply to replace bank proprietary e-banking with a multi-bank e-banking solution. This need not be disruptive at all, and can preserve the subsidiaries’ existing bank relations and ways of working.</p>
<p>At least when it comes to making payments and receiving bank statements, most banks’ web portals have similar functionality, along the lines of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enter or upload payments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Re-use payment templates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Approval matrixes by value and seniority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Payment status tracking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read and download statements and advices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A multi-bank replacement for proprietary e-banking allows treasurers and head office in general increased visibility over flows, balances, controls, and costs – discretely and without interfering with subsidiaries’ autonomy and process idiosyncrasies. SWIFT’s Alliance solution can cover these functionalities, as can many other products.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Even without the centralisation and standardised processes implied in SSCs, there is a strong case for payment factories to enhance control and reduce costs through economies of scale and efficient payment routing”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many variations between the low-tech e-banking swap out described above and the high-volume pipe connecting ERP to banks. SSCs normally rely heavily on the integrity of their ERPs – purchase orders (POs) and delivery notes (DNs) are approved by business operations, the ERP checks that invoices match the relevant POs and DNs and often pays the invoices automatically – “No PO, no pay”.</p>
<p>Many companies are not fully confident in the security of their ERPs; they want a final check before the money flows out of their accounts. Banks cover this scenario by reading in payments in host-to-host mode (ERP-to-bank file transfer) then allowing authorised signatories to log on to their e-banking and approve payments. Multi-bank solutions offer the same functionality.</p>
<h3 id="payment-factories-and-obo">Payment factories and OBO</h3>
<p>Payment factories have long been associated with payment on behalf of (POBO) and receipt on behalf of (ROBO) (together, on behalf of, or OBO). Basically, instead of using subsidiaries’ bank accounts to collect and pay, the payment factory opens accounts in its own name in relevant countries, and pays and collects from these accounts on behalf of subsidiaries. A variation is that the payment factory commandeers subsidiaries’ accounts in each country for group use.</p>
<p>This eliminates subsidiary bank accounts and thus reduces the number of bank accounts in the group and their associated costs and operational risk. More importantly, OBO facilitates efficient payment routing by eliminating expensive cross-border flows.</p>
<h3 id="payment-factories-and-ihb">Payment factories and IHB</h3>
<p>Another logical extension of the payment factory is to warehouse payments for planning purposes and to concentrate intercompany settlements to reduce payment fees, FX spread, float, and operational risk.</p>
<p>In-house bank (IHB) functionality provides for all of this by allowing payments and receipts to be posted on an intercompany account, together with intercompany flows, and settled once a month.</p>
<p>IHB maintains the goal of preserving subsidiary independence. An external bank account is simply replaced by an intercompany account. The intercompany account can have limits such as zero or other overdraft limits, pay credit interest at arm’s-length rates, in addition to other features. This can be helpful if the group does not use value-based management metrics like ROIC, EVA, or other WACC measures.</p>
<p>One caveat is that IHB balances, being intercompany balances, bring tax risks. They may be attacked on transfer pricing, withholding tax, thin capitalisation, deemed dividend, and other fronts. Notional pooling, when done properly, has many advantages in this respect. Another simple workaround is to arrange local third-party funding combined with a zero overdraft on the intercompany account.</p>
<h3 id="payment-factories-are-global">Payment factories are global</h3>
<p>There is a myth that none of this works in developing countries. In fact in Asia, the majority of these benefits are available in most commercially important countries. Flexibility can bring many of the benefits while complying with regulations. Examples include dropping OBO and using “gross in – gross out” in countries that prohibit netting.</p>
<p>Both OBO and IHB work (and are being done) in China and can be applied cross-border under the new regulatory framework. Being new, it will take some explaining to banks and regulators in far flung corners – for example letters explaining OBO for vendors to show to their banks. Some companies have decided to zero balance IHB accounts for Chinese entities at month end.</p>
<h3 id="payment-factories-for-decentralised-groups">Payment factories for decentralised groups</h3>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, I want to state here that I am a big believer in centralisation of back office operations in SSCs, payment factories, treasury centres, etc. I believe that front-line management should be free to focus on attracting and retaining customers – which Peter Drucker called the core purpose of business – not bogged down in back office administration duties.</p>
<p>That said, centralisation does not suit all business models and cultures, so there is a need for effective solutions for such groups. Groups who find the centralising plug-and-play model unsuitable, will find this payment factory functionality allows them to materially decrease costs and reduce operational risk without interfering with their subsidiaries’ unique business models and processes.</p>

<p>For many companies today, the cheapest source of funds remains their own cash. In the years following the financial crisis of 2008/09, corporates of all shapes and sizes made significant efforts to free-up trapped cash from within their operations in order to optimise working capital. Fast forward to the present day and companies are starting to take that process one step further.</p>
<p>While there are still significant working capital efficiencies for companies to explore, forward-thinking corporates are now looking at their operations through a longer lens. Rather than seeking short-term wins alone, they are looking holistically at the ways in which the company’s operational, organisational, process, and systems architecture interacts with their financial and commercial flows — with the twin goals of increasing visibility and creating value for the business as it looks to accelerate growth.</p>
<p>In short, smart companies are asking themselves: “What is our plan for success? Where are we going on our corporate journey? What high-level goals should we be setting over the longer term? And how can we best structure the company to maximise efficiencies?”</p>
<h3 id="the-treasurer-as-change-agent">The treasurer as change agent</h3>
<p>With an ever-expanding remit that has spilled over from traditional cash and FX responsibilities into areas such as the supply chain and shared services, the treasurer’s role in this transformation process is pivotal. No longer bound by departmental silos, treasurers are able to use their extended reach to act as an interface between the financial and commercial activities of the company.</p>
<p>By working collaboratively, treasurers are perfectly placed to act as change agents — and to ask the questions that really matter: “Is the group’s account structure optimally arranged so that it captures the maximum amount of liquidity to support the company’s working capital goals? And are ERP and Treasury Management Systems (TMS) being leveraged to their full extent?” Getting to the bottom of these questions often requires expert help, which is precisely why many companies looking to plan their way forward, mitigate future risks, and maximise shareholder value, call on trusted advisors to assist them. In fact, Citi is currently working hand-in-hand with its clients, in both developed and emerging economies, to help them build a tailored blueprint for success. Citi has established three Innovation Laboratories located in Dublin, Singapore and Miami that collaborate to develop enhanced diagnostic tools and solutions for their clients globally, whether located in Asia, Europe, Middle East, Africa or the Americas. Clients are also invited to visit any of the Labs for detailed blueprinting sessions to assist them in accelerating the development of the core framework for their global treasury transformation activities.</p>
<p>The first step in this analysis process is to undertake a diagnostic survey of your treasury and operational processes, risk management and governance policies in order to benchmark your company against its peers.</p>
<h3 id="lets-run-some-diagnostics">Let’s run some diagnostics</h3>
<p>“Citi® Treasury Diagnostics (CTD) is an award-winning tool Citi has developed for corporate treasurers. It enables treasurers to compare, on a confidential basis, their current treasury finance practices and policies with other companies, both industry peers and best-in-class companies from other sectors. This helps to identify current strengths and areas for improvement,” explains Michael Guralnick, Global Head of Corporate and Public Sector Sales and Global Marketing, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi.</p>
<p>So how does it work? “Well, CTD is a web-based, easy-to-use, tool which securely collects information about your company’s fundamental treasury disciplines through an online survey conducted with the company’s treasury team. Since the survey questions have been carefully crafted by treasury practitioners and market research specialists, they are targeted to extract precisely the right information for the task in hand. Naturally, all responses are absolutely confidential between the client and Citi,” explains Guralnick.</p>
<p>Currently nearly 500 clients around the world have taken the CTD survey and have had diagnostic sessions to review the benchmarking results. Citi® Treasury Diagnostics benchmarks in six critical areas of treasury and finance activities, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Governance and controls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liquidity management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cash and working capital management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Entity funding and repatriation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Risk management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Systems and technology.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tailoring-the-fit">Tailoring the fit</h3>
<p>With the benchmarking data now complete, the next step is to jointly evaluate the results and look to build a blueprint that is specific to the company’s needs. “This is the stage where our advisory services really come into play,” says Guralnick. “When we start to peel the onion and look at what’s going on beneath the surface, it’s important that we not only put clients’ objectives first, but actually take the time to understand what makes sense for the business in the longer term. This is not about plugging holes with products.”</p>
<p>As such, the process is highly bespoke. While best practice is the name of the game, it’s also about finding the best fit for the company. “For example, certain clients, based on their own resource capacity, may elect to address just one or two of the six pillars initially. Whether they want to put in place a plan to address the rest, and in what timeframe, is their decision entirely.”</p>
<p>There is no one size fits all blueprint. “So, whether a company should be centralised, decentralised or partly centralised is not a decision you can simply make on paper,” he explains. “We sit down and have a detailed discussion about how the company’s financial and commercial activities, as well as legal entities are organised. Because whatever finance or treasury does, and however it is structured, it needs to be optimally organised to support the commercial activities of the company”. The benchmarking results help provide direction and a framework for continued discussion and must fit with the overall corporate strategic goals and investment direction.</p>
<h3 id="asking-tough-questions">Asking tough questions</h3>
<p>This advisory process will usually be followed by a fair amount of corporate internal discussion, not least around the difference between an effective process and an efficient process. It will also provide a good opportunity to question the status quo, Guralnick believes. “So, where a highly decentralised company is using a significant number of local banks, for example, we would highlight the possibilities to simplify and standardise the company’s banking architecture and interfaces to eliminate inefficiencies.”</p>
<p>Analysing the return on investment (ROI) that the company is getting from its ERP system is another good example of how the evaluation process adds value. “Many companies have invested a significant amount of capital to install what they believe to be best-in-class platforms and systems. Now, after these investments have been made, most companies are asking if they are deriving the maximum ROI from them, and if not, what plans do they need to put in place on an enterprise basis to achieve the initial expected benefits,” Guralnick explains.</p>
<p>The good news is that, given the fast pace of technological development, better and cheaper connectivity models are emerging all the time. And with greater collaboration taking place between banks, vendors and clients, re-thinking the systems architecture of the company is helping accelerate the benefits initially envisioned.</p>
<p>Helping corporates to fully understand the benefits of big data is an additional key part of Citi’s advisory process. “Big data is driving next generation treasury solutions. By turning data into useful information for decision-making, corporates can better manage their overall transactional activities including supplier payment options, and global and regional liquidity pools. “In fact, big data analytics and related advisory is set to transform how business decisions are made across the procure-to-pay cycle. And that’s where Citi comes in,” Guralnick says.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier Citi’s network of Innovation Labs, is dedicated to reinventing the client experience for digital banking. These centres of innovation allow Citi and its clients to work in collaboration to create and deliver the next generation of financial products and solutions. Citi can assist companies in digitally enabling their financial operations and visualising their supply chain operations. By turning intelligent data into actionable insights, Citi can deliver innovative solutions that transform client’s banking processes, improve productivity and generate new ideas for commercial opportunities.</p>
<p>Citi’s Interactive Solutions is a treasury application, developed by Citi’s Innovation Lab in Singapore. This treasury solutioning tool leverages Citi’s global proprietary data and publicly available industry data, combining it with the latest real-time visualisation technology. The application gives Citi clients the ability to benchmark their treasury and liquidity management performance against peers using publically-available data, thereby enabling them to develop new blueprints and gain increased visibility, mobility and control over their working capital.</p>
<h3 id="getting-the-blueprint-right">Getting the blueprint right</h3>
<p>What is important to remember about the blueprint, says Guralnick, is that it’s a guideline. “When you’re building a house, the architect will draw up plans, but then you’ll amend them, adding a window here and a door there. And even during construction, you’ll make little changes. Similarly, with the company’s treasury transformation blueprint, flexibility is critical. The plan should be designed to evolve with the company’s commercial activities, and as global forces, such as regulatory and macroeconomic variables change, the company will need to adjust its model.”</p>
<p>Citi itself is a prime example of this in action. “We’re absolutely looking to the future and thinking about how we should adapt our business model to the changing environment,” says Guralnick. “As such, our aim is to be the world’s digital bank. Not only because technology is driving innovation, but because digitisation leads to a whole host of benefits to our clients in terms of consistency, control and compliance. We want to ensure that we are providing standardised processes and platforms, because that leads to productivity and cost benefits to our clients.</p>
<p>“The fact that we are in over 95 countries around the world means that our clients can rely on a consistency of platform and service, wherever they are operating. Citi has a pedigree dating back more than 200 years, and having invested in the international markets since 1902, we understand how businesses evolve — and what makes them successful in the long run.”</p>

<h3 id="smart-thinking">Smart thinking</h3>
<p>Once the client has agreed to the new blueprint, it’s all about execution. “What also sets us apart are our certified project management teams, who follow a very detailed process to construct the rollout plan with the client, assisting them every step of the way to achieve their goals. While it may sound like a cliché, our success is defined by the success of our clients,” says Guralnick. “Additionally investment in our Treasury Advisory Group, made up of former corporate treasury practitioners, enables us to bring a deep understanding of corporate treasury activities to the blueprinting sessions, and how to address the challenges our clients are addressing. These Citi experts have been in our clients’ shoes and they understand important industry nuances to benefit our clients. Their insights allow us to understand what tools actually add value to the treasurer.”</p>
<p>Guralnick sees this as the way forward for transaction banking. “Citi will continue to provide added-value to clients through analytical and decision-support tools, driven by big data and data mining.” Complementing those tools, a diagnostic and advisory approach will increasingly allow Citi to differentiate itself from other financial institutions; through helping clients work smarter by providing world-class advisory services and solutions to help them prepare for the future.</p>
<p>At a time when treasurers are working harder than ever, Citi’s approach will surely provide significant productivity and commercial benefits to its clients.</p>

<h3 id="from-benchmarking-to-blueprint">From benchmarking to blueprint</h3>
<h4 id="the-challenge">The challenge</h4>
<p>Transform the treasury of one of the world’s largest mining companies to support the $22 billion company’s global growth plans.</p>
<h4 id="the-blueprint">The blueprint</h4>
<p>Citi worked with a leading Brazil-based mining company to understand the strategy and business model of the company and the nuances and constraints presented by the local and global environments in which it works. The first step was a complete benchmarking of the organisation’s treasury operation. Then, together, Citi and the company designed a blueprint for success, which comprised three missions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Identify and address tax, legal and technology discrepancies across the enterprise</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consolidate information and clean up processes to optimise cash flow forecasting and planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop a clearly defined cash management approach unique to the company</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Any treasury transformation blueprint, by design, rationalises and simplifies a complex task, and in this case, the end result was a more efficient and agile treasury operation. Citi’s effective, knowledgeable and global network of expert Treasury and Trade Solutions managers on the ground, combined with the company’s new streamlined and powerful internal processes, made possible advanced cash forecasting and planning, and lowered risks of idle excess cash in uncertain markets.</p>
<p>Now, the company’s treasury operation secures the liquidity necessary for the execution of projects and ongoing operations, and ensures that financial resources in the appropriate amounts are in the right place at the right time to fund projects. That is the way to ensure the success of the company’s long-terms goals, and a true blueprint for success.</p>

<h3 id="swift-messaging">SWIFT messaging</h3>
<p>SWIFT runs two messaging systems. The old system is called FIN with messages many are familiar with like MT101/3 and MT940. FIN’s age means it was designed as a single byte system, which does not have capacity for large and diverse character sets.</p>
<p>The newer (more than ten years old now) system is ISO 20022 XML or MX messages like ‘pain’ (payment initiation equivalent to MT103) and ‘camt’ (customer account statement equivalent to MT940). Being more recent and XML based, ISO 20022 messages use double bytes and support a practically unlimited number of character sets.</p>
<p>What this means is that ISO 20022, pain and camt messages can handle Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Cyrillic, Arabic, Sanskrit, Hebrew, and any other character set you can think of. Of course they also handle Roman character sets.</p>
<p>If you need proof, consider that almost all countries either have recently implemented or are in the process of implementing ISO 20022 for local clearing. That includes several non-Roman character sets in my back yard (Asia), such as China (CNAPS2), India (ACH), Japan (BOJNet), and so on. Incidentally, many are also immediate payments systems too – the beneficiary is credited immediately and the banks do an end of day net settlement through their central bank, so a bit different from the high value RTGS clearing systems.</p>
<p>To achieve end-to-end straight through processing (STP), we need all parties to be able to handle whatever character set we need to use.</p>
<p>Logically when you pay CNY onshore, all parties can handle Chinese character sets so there should be no loss of information. Likewise, any local payment will go through parties who are all onshore and therefore adapted to the local character set.</p>
<p>Be aware, however, that not all clearing systems support all ISO 20022 functionality. A key potential issue for treasurers concerns data payloads. Corporate to bank pain messages allow 1MB or more of data to be transmitted as part of the message as beneficiary information – typically remittance advices and invoice details. Not all clearing systems, even those based on ISO 20022, support this feature, so alternative arrangements (typically bank to bank transfer of data payloads) must be made. The central banks and clearing houses seem to feel they are in the settlements business not the data carrying business. We, as a profession, have failed to communicate to them that cash is nice but cash we can apply is even nicer.</p>

<p>Assuming a corporate to corporate payment, we have to consider multiple parties.</p>
<img alt="Corporate connectivity vs clearing | Holistic STP" class="center" height="300" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/2014/07/2014-07and-08-tta-11-pv-corporate-connectivity-vs-clearing-holistic-stp.png" style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block;" width="126"/>
</div>
<h3 id="erp-connectivity">ERP connectivity</h3>
<p>Of course, even when all the connections described above are aligned, corporate ERPs have to be able to handle the required character sets. I will illustrate using SAP as an example.</p>
<p>Assuming your SAP is primarily in Roman characters, and using Chinese payments as an example, you will set up alternate vendor master records for Chinese characters including the beneficiary and bank names that will be used in CNAPS2. Chinese characters from these alternate records will be used when you run the payment proposal to create a payment file. This is what will generate the ISO 20022 pain records in whatever tool you use to communicate with your banks.</p>
<h3 id="fin-workaround">FIN workaround</h3>
<p>For those who are congenitally opposed to XML, a handful of FIN workarounds were developed 20 years ago, before XML caught on. The three most common workarounds are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use a modified FIN protocol with double byte characters. This can work fine between corporate and bank. It will require tweaking the software at both ends, since these are non-standard FIN messages. And of course they will not work across SWIFT itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put your vendor code or number in the beneficiary field after separately uploading your non-Roman vendor bank details to your bank. Your bank can then substitute the non-Roman characters for the vendor code and process the payments. First this is non-standard, the messages will go across SWIFT but the resulting payments would be gibberish. Second, you have to make sure the non-Roman vendor bank details at your bank are up to date and have not been tampered with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agree some kind of double byte layered on FIN’s single byte character set that can be used between you and your bank. This will be hard work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since many have to work with ISO 20022 anyway for SEPA and increasingly other payment infrastructures, XML just feels like the path of least resistance. But there are (inconvenient) alternatives.</p>
<p>As an aside, let me dispel another SWIFT myth. “ISO 20022 is for bulk payments. You have to use FIN (MT) for high value urgent payments.” Although FIN interpretation is built into the SWIFT network, whereas XML normally goes through FileAct (a different SWIFT service), the speed and the repudiability of both types of messages are the same. I base this statement on extensive testing with three banks when I faced this myth during a SWIFT implementation.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>SWIFT can do Chinese and any other character set. FIN cannot but XML most certainly can. FIN is a 40 year old standard based on telex. XML is the standard of the future, already used in your ERP, the internet, and so on. And its reliability has been established over more than ten years. Which would you rather use for your corporate to bank messaging?</p>

<p>Until recently, exchange controls dominated cross-border flows in and out of China. Trade flows were allowed but an arduous process of pre-approval by the State Administration for Foreign Exchange (SAFE) took time and effort from local staff of MNCs in China. Employees had to take stacks of forms, invoices, customs documents, and so on to SAFE offices to be chopped before taking them to their bank for verification and payment. We got this down to a fine art, but it still drove delays and inefficiency.</p>
<p>Capital account flows were much tougher. Long pre-approval through multiple government agencies was the norm, often including the ministry responsible for the industry sector. Short-circuiting the system could have ruinous consequences – for example improperly registered loans might be treated as income, thus taxed at 25%, and then there would be no paperwork to document getting the money out again.</p>
<p>Dividends have always worked – as long as you were prepared to graft to make them work. First you need audited accounts, then sign off from the tax department, then SAFE and possibly ministry approval – all this took three months at best, not to mention the expense and effort required. In short, cross-border loans out from China were only possible on an exceptional basis, with challenging approval requirements.</p>
<h3 id="cnh-trade-flows">CNH trade flows</h3>
<p>CNH is the unofficial currency code for CNY circulating offshore. The “H” refers to Hong Kong where offshore CNY first started. CNY is the ISO code for Chinese Yuan – sometimes called RMB (‘renminbi’ or ‘people’s money’) – and is the only code recognised by SWIFT and other official platforms. Despite occasional arbitrage, CNH = CNY – just as USD circulating in a developing country behind exchange controls may attract different interest rates than offshore USD, but is still USD.</p>
<p>CNH has been popular in Hong Kong since 2004. So much so that Hong Kong citizens regularly cross the border to Shenzhen to get cheap food and shopping and load up on CNY, well up to CNY 20,000 (sometimes for each child too) which is the cash limit crossing the border.</p>
<p>In June 2009, China allowed selected companies to trade cross-border in CNH. Since September 2011, any Chinese company (both local and foreign owned) can pay and receive CNH cross-border. Furthermore, since CNH is not foreign exchange under the remit of SAFE, cross-border CNH payments are not subject to ex-ante SAFE approval described above. CNH payments are approved by banks, can be 100% electronic (with an obligation to produce paper if audited), and thus fast and efficient. China has deliberately made it easier to pay out in CNH than in foreign currency, to boost internationalisation of CNY.</p>
<p>I still hear people saying that CNH flows are restricted to DMEs (Designated Mainland Entities – the lucky few in 2009), I want to reiterate that since September 2011, all Chinese entities can pay and receive CNH cross-border. This is a substantial benefit to any cross-border business in China from multiple perspectives. It opens the possibility of more efficient FX hedging and streamlined cash and working capital management.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I still hear people saying that CNH flows are restricted to DMEs (Designated Mainland Entities – the lucky few in 2009), I want to reiterate that since September 2011, all Chinese entities can pay and receive CNH cross border.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="cross-border-loans">Cross-border loans</h3>
<p>Last year saw the spread of two routes for inter-company lending from China to offshore. SAFE introduced a programme for inter-company loans in foreign currency. This has been popular with MNCs who accumulate FX onshore and do not want to convert to CNY. The downside is that SAFE requires case by case pre-approval of each facility.</p>
<p>SAFE also introduced FX Concentration Header Accounts through which onshore entities can manage FX with bank accounts in Shanghai. Their purpose is to facilitate bringing corporate treasury onshore in line with China’s goal to make Shanghai an international financial centre by 2020. Amongst other things, FX Concentration Header Accounts are used to sweep funds cross-border thereby connecting onshore pools with global cash pools offshore.</p>
<p>The most popular cross-border inter-company lending scheme is the PBOC’s. PBOC has liberalised cross-border lending rules to support the internationalisation of CNY. Onshore entities can, reasonably freely, make cross-border loans to related parties offshore. In most regions, PBOC has delegated approval to commercial banks. In some regions it seems the local PBOC is approving facilities itself, but firstly the approval is not onerous and secondly, it is easy enough to do the loans through bank accounts in Shanghai (where approval is delegated to banks) so this is not a big impediment.</p>
<p>These cross-border inter-company loans can be implemented as simple bullets, or as term loans under a facility, or as a bank-automated sweep. The latter provides a route to integrate China liquidity to global liquidity pools in a fully automated and efficient manner.</p>
<p>Sweeping is allowed in both directions – out from China and into China – but the net balance (for the time being) must be a net loan from China to offshore. Treasurers are keen to see full two way sweeping, and PBOC is trialling this in the new Shanghai Free Trade Zone. This trial is widely expected to go nationwide soon.</p>
<p>The maximum amount of these inter-company loans is capped at the total capital of the onshore entity. There is some disagreement amongst commercial banks about the group limits when connecting onshore pools to global pools. In any case, the cap is high enough to allow considerable flexibility for MNCs operating in China.</p>
<p>I imagine many readers are thinking this is too good to be true. China is a large and complex country, and will provide years’ more excitement for treasurers, but what I describe above really is available, and really is not that hard. Treasurers who have implemented these solutions – even when they needed to get pre-approval – generally report that the internal issues (like getting board resolutions to open new bank accounts and change management) were more challenging than the external ones (like regulators and banks).</p>
<p>Yields on CNH are lower than CNY, so, once you have got your CNY offshore, you need to do something with it. The most common choices are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Keep CNH in a notional pool offshore (and drawdown other currencies).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use CNH to pay internal or external suppliers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Swap CNH to another needed currency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A combination of the above.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="farewell-to-trapped-cash">Farewell to trapped cash?</h3>
<p>To sum up, as of now: any entity can pay and receive CNH cross-border without pre-approval; FX can be swept on and off shore with SAFE approval; CNY can be swept offshore without pre-approval.</p>
<p>Surely, that should pretty much take care of trapped cash? Well, at the very least, it certainly gives rise to a more nuanced view of trapped cash. We can say that regulations and particularly the exchange controls are no longer such a big problem in China. The tax constraints (both onshore and offshore) are likely to remain unchanged, but that is another can of worms entirely. So, yes, I think we can say this is the end of (regulatory) trapped cash in China.</p>
<p>As a postscript it is remarkable how quickly these changes have been rolled out. It shows that China is very serious about internationalising CNY and also very serious about bringing more market discipline to onshore markets. Watch this space very closely.</p>

<h5 id="how-is-this-impacting-their-priorities">What are the major challenges that corporate treasurers face in the Asia region today and how is this impacting their priorities?</h5>
<p>There is growing uncertainty regarding the economic outlook in Asia and globally. In any situation where the direction of the economy is not clear, there are three main areas corporate treasurers in Asia need to focus on – maximising liquidity, optimising working capital, and increasing accuracy in their cash flow forecasting.</p>
<p>The first of these is the management of corporate liquidity pools across disparate local markets. For example, trapped cash or money stuck in restrictive markets for diverse reasons such as regulatory constraints, capital requirements, currency convertibility and transferability, and tax issues, is a real barrier to efficient global cash deployment for multinational companies that operate in Asia. In fact, the more successful a company becomes, the greater the need to effectively manage and mobilise profits or cash reserves to maintain competitive advantage. Leading companies in the region, whether they are western or emerging markets corporates, would generally pursue the dual strategy of generating cash and then optimising the cash generated.</p>
<p>In Asia, corporates have to navigate a diverse blend of markets. On the one hand, the region has highly developed markets such as Singapore and Hong Kong while, on the other, there are tightly regulated markets such as India, and Indonesia. Since corporate treasurers often find visibility over liquidity in such conditions difficult to achieve, we try to help our clients by performing diagnostics with them and assisting them to benchmark their performance against their peers. Once that has been achieved, we can also help them to mobilise their liquidity with pooling structures that can be used to distribute any excess liquidity they are holding across the operating accounts of business entities with liquidity shortages.</p>
<p>The second consideration is that volatile market conditions necessitate a stronger focus on working capital. That is not just for the benefit of the corporate’s own balance sheet, but also to lubricate their supply chain, both on the buy and the sell side. In certain markets – India, Korea, Hong Kong and, to an extent, China – we have seen growing interest amongst our clients in supplier finance solutions, both in terms of the financing of receivables and payables as a result.</p>
<p>The final item is cash flow forecasting, which nobody wants surprises with. It might be that there is a large debt payment suddenly due or a large inflow that the treasurer needs to find a good use for. Either way, the treasurer doesn’t want to be scrambling for cash or planning the allocation of funds at the last minute.</p>
<h5 id="how-does-that-correspond-with-your-plans-for-citis-treasury-and-trade-solutions-tts-going-forward">With those three macro challenges in mind, how does that correspond with your plans for Citi’s Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS) going forward?</h5>
<p>In Asia, one of our big strengths is our international footprint. Since many of our clients are large western multinationals or large local emerging market companies, both of which are also very international, our first priority is making sure our network is easy for our clients to access and use. That has been the driver of a significant proportion of our investment in recent years.</p>
<p>One of the other things we have been doing is expanding the size and the scale of our local product suite. This investment in the local capabilities of our network allows us to compete with local banks. But what we do then, and this is what really differentiates us from other banks, is to overlay that with a technology platform that is common across all countries. So, if you are a treasurer trying to deal with multiple markets, you can use tailored products for each local market and access them through our common horizontal technology layer. It is a very powerful combination.</p>
<p>We are also investing heavily in our liquidity management products and services. The cornerstone of our market-leading global liquidity network is something we call the Global Concentration Engine, a platform for automated cash mobilisation services that offers our clients a great deal of flexibility with respect to how they want to do their cash pooling. One of our main objectives at the moment is investing in this platform – making it available in even more markets. As a result of recent deregulatory initiatives, our clients are now able to use the platform in Singapore and Hong Kong for renminbi transactions.</p>
<p>With the increasing digitisation of financial services, more companies are now seeking efficient technology solutions to drive automation in their treasury services. Citi has continued to enhance our integrated set of channels, platforms and products to provide one-stop solutions for multinational clients. CitiDirect BE, our flagship next-generation corporate banking platform is core to our digital strategy, enabling access to comprehensive cash management capabilities and advanced analytical tools via a single, global portal. New e-channels such as mobile and tablet banking are also enabling clients to manage their accounts and transactions while on the go. For example, our CitiDirect BE Tablet, launched in Asia last year, provides treasurers with advanced data visualisation features, including geographical driven graphical results of account balances, and drill down options to global, regional, country or individual account level.</p>
<p>So, in summary, we are working to expand out our local capabilities while striving to have a uniform platform across the region’s markets. The investments we have made to this end over recent years have enabled us to roll out very sophisticated products across Asia’s markets. For instance, we recently concluded a pilot of a set of risk management tools to help clients identify and track occurrences of fraud or non-bona fide transactions, which we were then able to take and roll out across 16 markets in the region. Another example is a product we recently rolled out on the receivables side that can take invoice data and overlay it on top of an incoming payment, before it is automatically reconciled through the client’s ERP system. Again, we rolled this product out across all 16 countries – which is a great feat.</p>
<h5 id="what do-you-feel-are-the-next-big-steps">What is Citi’s involvement in helping liberalisation of the renminbi in China? What do you feel are the next big steps?</h5>
<p>Since it is a constantly evolving issue, it is important to step back and take in the bigger picture. Looking back, the progress that has been made over the past 12 months has been truly phenomenal. It is amazing to think that just over a year ago there was little or no movement of money out of China and a lot of multinationals had years of cash just sitting in China. Suddenly, around June time last year we saw the first string of regulations and ever since then barely two weeks passes without another development. The first approvals were for one-way loans, but this was soon extended to an ongoing two-way sweep and further liberalisation within the recently established Shanghai Free Trade Zone (SFTZ).</p>
<p>Citi has, without a doubt, been at the forefront of these initiatives providing access for our clients as new capabilities are piloted and approved. This allows our clients to do two fundamental things. First and foremost, it allows them to release their trapped cash from China to aid group working capital, thereby reducing the dependence of other entities on bank finance for funding. Likewise, it allows China entities to access funding from the pool when they themselves are short of liquidity.</p>
<p>Liberalisation also presents other opportunities for multinationals. We are seeing a growing number of companies using RMB as an invoicing currency, for example. A lot of western multinationals that traditionally invoice in dollars are beginning to think about using renminbi for invoicing as it can offer a natural hedge for FX exposures.</p>
<p>Although we have seen enormous progress in terms of liberalisation, there is still work to do. The next step for the Chinese regulators in the coming years is to bring in measures that will improve the depth of offshore RMB markets because right now, China really has two separate currencies; onshore and offshore. I think there is also a need for a more sophisticated clearing infrastructure if we are to see the renminbi gain the robustness it needs to develop into a truly international currency.</p>
<h5 id="what-projects-are-we-seeing-there-that-are-particularly-significant-at-the-moment">How important is the Shanghai Free Trade Zone and what projects are we seeing there that are particularly significant at the moment?</h5>
<p>It is hugely important. I visited our branch which we opened in the zone recently and believe the Chinese regulators are showing signs of serious intent with what they are doing there. Ultimately, if the zone is successful, the plan is to roll the pilots out into more geographies within China, as we saw previously with other economic initiatives such as the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone.</p>
<h5 id="to-what-extent-are-treasurers-in-asia-embracing-mobile-technology">To what extent are treasurers in Asia embracing mobile technology?</h5>
<p>I used to be quite sceptical about the application of mobile technology in the treasury space, but about three years ago my view began to change. At Citi we began to realise that consumer trends in mobile technology were really something we needed to embrace in our corporate finance offerings, to make it easier for the treasurer to access his or her work on the move.</p>
<p>Just over two years ago, we launched the award-winning CitiDirect® BE Mobile solution and we were amazed with the uptake and the sheer volume of transactions we saw flowing through the mobile channel. In 2013 alone, over 2 million transactions valued at more than $140 billion had flowed through our mobile platform, of which, over $36 billion has been in Asia.</p>
<h5 id="what-do-you-think-are-the-key-geographies-to-watch-in-asia-at-the-moment">What do you think are the key geographies to watch in Asia at the moment?</h5>
<p>The China market is a hugely exciting and vibrant opportunity for us. The pace of liberalisation continues to step up, and the timing is opportune as we assist our clients to link their Chinese franchise with their existing global and regional treasury and liquidity structures. Also Chinese parented companies are increasingly widening their footprint around the world, and this once again is a very rich partnership for us as we support them in this journey.</p>
<p>India remains one of the world’s most important markets – and they are reforming their economy and financial system. We have been helping clients to evaluate treasury management changes and provide optimal structures and processes to take advantage of these reforms. These include optimisation of funding options for investments, digitisation of payments with the launch of their national automated clearing house, and growth in mobile payment solutions.</p>
<p>Markets such as Singapore and Hong Kong continue to have a high level of importance, given their status as regional hubs where corporate pooling is concentrated. But I also think the Korean and Taiwan markets are hugely significant at the moment, given that a large number of exporters are based there. Then there are key markets such as Australia and Indonesia. Both of these countries are important regional markets due to their size, more than anything, but are at opposite ends of the economic spectrum. Australia is highly developed and advanced while the other, Indonesia, is still an emerging economy. But that is precisely the fun of the Asia Pacific region!</p>
<h5 id="from-a-trade-finance-perspective-is-the-support-always-there-for-corporates">What are your views on intra-Asian trade? From a trade finance perspective is the support always there for corporates?</h5>
<p>Intra-Asia trade flows are continuing to give rise to new opportunities for companies in the region. If you look at the figures about 53% regional trade flows are directed to other Asian economies and, to add to that, more than half of Asia’s imports or exports end up or originate within the continent. So this is evidently a hugely important component of the Asian economy.</p>
<p>In terms of trade finance, there is no shortage of supply at the moment for large corporates across countries such as Singapore, Korea, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Australia. If anything, demand is now beginning to slow down as overall exports on the continent begin to drop off.</p>
<p>But if you go down a level, the story is rather different. For small and medium sized businesses trade finance is not so readily available. This is why, when we talk about trade finance with our clients, we try really hard to understand their ecosystem. For example, we try to find out who their obligors are, who they sell to and where they buy from, and try to provide liquidity to those counterparties for the benefit our client.</p>
<h5 id="what-tools-would-you-like-introduce-if-you-could">If the Asian regulatory environment was not so complex, what tools would you like introduce if you could?</h5>
<p>My answer goes back to the challenge of accurate cash flow forecasting which I raised earlier. Regrettably, that remains an unfulfilled challenge for many of our clients and one that we are working hard to resolve. If it could be solved in a bank agnostic fashion – not just between a client and Citi – it could be a tool that would make life for corporate treasurers in Asia considerably easier.</p>
<p>And then there would be further development of tools to take advantage of big data. This is already happening, it is no longer just an idea that we are toying with, it is actually driving our conversations with our clients. Having this more interactive way to communicate with clients, backed by analytics, is pretty transformational as far as transaction banking goes.</p></div>

<p>What a difference those few years make!</p>
<p>The India of my memories was a caricature nightmare of clearing times measured in weeks for so-called “up country” or “out station” cheques and byzantine bureaucracy. It was so awful that you just had to laugh – a lesson in acceptance worthy of any ashram.</p>
<p>Of course the licence raj is still thriving, and – regrettably for India’s people other corruption and inefficiencies remain problematic. However, someone lit a fire under India’s payment infrastructure and the progress has been remarkable in absolute terms and amazing in the context of India’s progress in most other areas.</p>
<p>For high value payments, India has a real-time gross settlement (RTGS) clearing system which is fast and widespread. Clearing is through the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and is final. RTGS is also the final inter-bank clearing for the low value systems.</p>
<p>The early low value clearing systems are national electronic funds transfer (NEFT) and electronic clearing service (ECS). NEFT has become common for credit transfers. NEFT is a net settlement system with 12 clearing cycles from 08:00 to 19:00 daily. ECS is commonly used for direct debits, but its popularity is limited because of its paper-based mandate management. The newer NACH (below) addresses this and other issues.</p>
<p>In 2008, the RBI established a private company called the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) to set up and run low value payment systems. The shareholders are banks, including two foreign banks – HSBC and Citi.</p>
<p>NPCI started by setting up an efficient low value clearing system based on international best practice. The National Automated Clearing House (NACH) provides both credit transfers and direct debits including electronic mandate management, using ISO20022 standards. NACH is being phased in to replace NEFT and ECS.</p>
<p>Electronic settlement already accounts for some 95% of value of INR (Indian Rupee) settlement and 50% of volume. These are nationwide figures – MNCs (multinational corporations) report higher figures. Even for companies using a lot of cheques, the situation has improved greatly.</p>
<p>The RBI mandated that all banks implement a core banking platform (CBP) to support electronic settlement and to enhance cheque processing. CBP enables so-called SPEED clearing of cheques using magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) and cheque truncation system (CTS). The net result is that 99% of cheques now clear within 48 hours.</p>
<p>CBP and electronic payments support a 30-character alpha-numeric account number field. Many local and global banks have built robust virtual account capabilities on the back of this. The best allow corporate customers to define virtual account codes on the fly, without the administrative overhead of setting up virtual account codes at the bank before use. And the RBI mandate means that the virtual account code entered by the payer will survive through any intermediary bank systems to arrive intact at the beneficiary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In 2008, the RBI established a private company called the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) to set up and run low-value payment systems. The shareholders are banks, including two foreign banks – HSBC and Citi”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A very interesting, albeit still early stage, initiative of NPCI is IMPS. Initially, IMPS stood for Indian mobile payment system, but the evolution and use case has been so rapid that IMPS has been rolled out as a multi-platform service and renamed IMmediate payment system.</p>
<p>IMPS provides real-time and final settlement retail payments, requiring only an online device and a bank account. So it enables the shift from cash to electronic in markets and bazaars all over India. IMPS has also generated enthusiasm from insurance companies, telecom operators and other corporates with high volumes of retail collections.</p>
<p>It is a fast-moving space globally, but IMPS has to be a strong contender for the most sophisticated and usable mobile payment system worldwide.</p>
<p>Where cash is still unavoidable – think field force petty cash and so forth – India’s ATM network works across banks and although there is a nominal fee for inter-bank cash withdrawal most banks seem happy to waive it for corporate customers. An adjacent technology that is gaining popularity in such cases is the use of corporate-issued debit cards.</p>
<p>Statutory payments used to be a nightmare, requiring companies to maintain accounts with state banks solely to pay local taxes. The government is pushing for all statutory payments to be multi-bank, taking advantage of the new electronic payment platforms. Further, most global banks and large local banks have the correspondent banking relationships required to handle statutory payments nationwide. This helps treasurers to drastically reduce the number of bank accounts required in India.</p>
<p>Cynics might at this point be thinking that all this impressive bank payment infrastructure must be confined to limited pilot schemes in the big metropolitan areas. Not so. These are all live nationwide rollouts. Building on the back of RBI-mandated CBP, almost all banks are online. India is a huge country so I am not sure whether a remote corner like Port Blair in the Andaman Islands would be online, but 99% of India’s GDP is covered and all of the big banks, both global and local.</p>
<p>My focus has been primarily on domestic INR settlement but I would be remiss if I did not mention a couple of adjacent issues.</p>
<p>FX controls have traditionally been a drag on productivity and efficiency because of the requirement for paper documentation for all cross-border flows. Much of that remains, but the RBI has delegated checking of trade documentation to commercial banks. This allows the banks to provide process efficiencies such as allowing scanned supporting documents to be provided online through e-banking along with payment instructions. (Of course, paper documentation must be available for subsequent audit where required.)</p>
<p>On a less positive note, India’s Companies Act 2013 has made cash concentration even more difficult. Cash pooling has never been easy in India – notional pooling is not allowed and sweeping creates what the Act calls “inter-corporate deposits” which are strictly controlled to stop local conglomerates from shifting funds between partially floated affiliates. MNC cash management is collateral damage. The new Act makes cash pooling more difficult but care with company directors can normally resolve issues arising from the common directors rules.</p>
<p>India has leapfrogged several generations of payment technology in an astonishingly short time – broadly five years. In terms of payment infrastructure, India is now in the top league. For the sake of a billion Indians suffering from corruption and inefficiency, I hope this astonishing leap in payment technology becomes the model for other reforms.</p>

<h5 class="title">Regional Head of Payments and Cash Management, HSBC Middle East and North Africa</h5>

<br/>
<p>Sunil Veetil is Regional Head of Payments and Cash Management, HSBC Middle East and North Africa. Based in Dubai, he is responsible for growing the Cash Management franchise across the region. Veetil relocated from South Korea where he was responsible for connecting the fast growing Korean businesses to the outside world, whilst positioning HSBC as the leader in Cash Management in the country.</p>
<p>Prior to South Korea, Veetil was in HSBC Indonesia heading the Payments and Cash Management business for three and a half years. Veetil started his career with HSBC in Dubai where he acted as the deputy head of transaction banking and regional head of product management for the Middle East region. Throughout his tenure in the Middle East, Indonesia and in South Korea, HSBC has been consistently recognised as the leading cash management provider in all these markets, as evidenced by the accolades received during that period. Prior to joining HSBC, Veetil worked with the logistics group FedEx and the rating firm Standard &amp; Poor’s. Veetil is a Chartered Accountant, Management Accountant, and Certified Treasury Professional and is a graduate of Mathematics.</p>
</img></div>
<p>Corporate treasurers operating in the MENA region are increasingly being faced with the challenges of operating in a cross-border, multi-currency environment. Sunil Veetil, Regional Head of Payments and Cash Management – MENA at HSBC, explains how treasury professionals can overcome these hurdles to make the most of the opportunities that these challenges present.</p>
<h5 id="how-has-the-mena-region-progressed-in-the-eight-years-that-you-have-been-away">You recently moved back to the Middle East to take up the role of Regional Head of Payments and Cash at HSBC. How has the MENA region progressed in the eight years that you have been away?</h5>
<p>There has been a great deal of positive growth in the MENA region in recent years, with one of the most obvious areas being trade volumes. This is certainly a trend that we at HSBC believe will continue to blossom, given that the MENA region sits as a strategic gateway between East and West. While the developed economies continue to be key trading partners for the MENA region, there is a definite move among businesses to expand their trade links with the emerging economies in Asia and Africa, too. Eastern Europe is another area of interest for MENA companies looking to open up new trading partnerships.</p>
<p>Intra-regional trade flows are also growing, which is helping to boost confidence in the sustainability of the MENA region, and the UAE in particular, as a trade hub. The UAE has also made remarkable strides in becoming a popular treasury hub. In the same way that locations such as Singapore and Hong Kong are top of the list for establishing centres of excellence or regional treasury centres in Asia, the UAE now has that reputation within the MENA region. This is in no small part thanks to the country’s developed infrastructure and the government’s work towards e-readiness.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, other countries in the region are also making significant advancements and are becoming increasingly attractive as strategic business locations as a result. Egypt, for instance, now has its own Digital Law and is extremely forward-thinking when it comes to intellectual property rights. And this is just one example – there are positive developments such as this happening right across the MENA region.</p>
<h5 id="what-have-been-the-most-noticeable-changes-or-greatest-leaps-forward-in-the-MENA-region-of-late">In terms of payments and cash management, what have been the most noticeable changes or greatest leaps forward in the MENA region of late?</h5>
<p>There have been numerous important changes which represent real progress in the world of payments. First and foremost, countries including Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have moved towards an IBAN-led bank account structure. This assists greatly with standardisation in the region.</p>
<p>The introduction of new or more efficient settlement infrastructures across many MENA countries is another important development. Egypt now has an established direct debits system and the UAE is following suit with UAEDDS. Although work is still ongoing for UAEDDS to be fully live, since very material payments infrastructure changes have been necessary, there is a two-phase approach in place that seems to be working well. Phase one went live on 5<sup>th</sup> October 2013 and saw DDs become available for the first time for mortgage payments and retail financing such as car loans. All UAE collections for personal financing can now be done through direct debits.</p>
<p>The next phase, which is likely to go live in Q2 2014, will see all other recurring payments, such as utility fees, service fees, insurance premiums, rent, school fees, retail loan repayments and credit card payments being carried out by UAEDDS. This will be of benefit to corporates operating in the region and will allow greater automation in their day-to-day payments and collections. Additional positives will include increased transparency and reduced usage of cheques.</p>
<p>Other countries within the GCC region, such as Qatar, are also now looking to adopt their own direct debits systems. This is something that HSBC sees as an extremely positive move. And having consulted on such projects across the globe, we are in an excellent position to not only be a vital part of these growing direct debit clearing infrastructures, but also to advise on best practice.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Lebanon has made enormous changes to its clearing and settlement infrastructure. After the successful launch of its Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system in 2012, the Central Bank of Lebanon unveiled a new Automated Clearing House (ACH) in November 2013 for the clearing of credit and debit transfers, including cheques and cards payments. This has vastly improved the safety, security and efficiency of the clearing and settlement of payments in Lebanon.</p>
<p>In the UAE, Oman and Qatar, image-based cheque clearing systems have been successfully introduced in recent years. These have boosted the efficiency and speed of cheque processing.</p>
<p>As such, it’s clear that individual countries across the MENA region have made great strides forward where payments and clearing are concerned. The next step will be the introduction of a GCC-wide clearing infrastructure, tailored to the specific needs of the region. Talks are already taking place among GCC authorities to work towards this natural progression.</p>
<h5 id="do-you-see-the-use-of-mobile-payments-increasing-in-mena">Do you see the use of mobile payments increasing in MENA?</h5>
<p>If you go back to the early 2000s, the Middle East was comparatively slow in adopting e-commerce. There were no real government-led initiatives to get the right infrastructure in place for the adoption of e-commerce, so the region was somewhat behind its Western counterparts. Fast forward a few years to the advent of smartphones though, and the MENA countries have been able to skip ahead.</p>
<p>A number of initiatives driven by regional governments have assisted with this ability to leapfrog the ‘PC age’, and a good example is the UAE’s Emirates ID card. Similar to a social security card, all UAE residents are issued with an Emirates ID card, which has a chip and PIN, and represents state-of-the-art technology in the field of smart cards. By May 2015, residents will be able to make payments to government offices by mobile phone, thanks to the creation of a nationwide mobile payments, identification and authentication system. This forms part of the UAE’s aim to create the world’s most sophisticated mGovernment.</p>
<p>Thanks to the improved payments and clearing infrastructure that I mentioned earlier, mobile initiatives such as this are now filtering down from government entities across the MENA region to the corporate sector. Over the next three to five years, we therefore expect the adoption of mobile payments among corporates to really take off, as well as the usage of apps that provide visibility into transactions.</p>
<p>Statistics from our award-winning HSBCnet Mobile solution certainly back this up: since our regional launch in November 2011 up until the end of September 2013, we processed over $900m worth of transactions. This figure not only reflects corporates’ open attitude to new technologies, but also that HSBC is very well positioned to capture the mobile opportunity.</p>
<h5 id="how-sophisticated-are-corporate-treasury-functions-in-the-region-in-terms-of-automation-and-technology">How sophisticated are corporate treasury functions in the region, in terms of automation and technology?</h5>
<p>When I was working in the region eight years ago, treasury technology (other than Excel spreadsheets) was merely a pipe-dream for many corporates. But revisiting these same corporates today, and looking at how they manage their treasury function now, there is a great deal of sophistication. One of the main drivers behind this gearing up is that MENA companies are increasingly expanding across the region and out into other markets. Managing treasury in a multi-country, multi-currency scenario is very challenging.</p>
<p>Technology is a good tool to help overcome these challenges. Through automation and FX solutions, for example, companies can quickly reduce their cross-border payments processing costs. Connecting with the right bank is also imperative to ensure smooth cross-country operations. At HSBC, for instance, we can help clients make the most of the opportunities that operating internationally presents. Perhaps by improving their regional concentration of funds, helping them to establish a shared-service centre (SSC), or even setting them up to use SWIFT.</p>
<p>What makes HSBC unique in this respect is that we have true global connectivity, with a presence in 75 countries and territories. We can connect an Asian, European or Middle Eastern MNC to various geographies both within the MENA region and outside it. In addition, we have sophisticated liquidity solutions available across all of these geographies that offer visibility on a real-time basis, as well as the ability to move currencies on a real-time basis. It’s about making a client’s money really work, regardless of geography or currency.</p>
<p>In short, while technology remains a key enabler for treasury functions, strategic partnerships with key relationship banks can leverage that technology to deliver even greater benefits.</p>
<h5 id="are-sscs-becoming-more-popular-in-the-region">Are SSCs becoming more popular in the region? If so, in which locations are they being established?</h5>
<p>We are certainly seeing a number of corporates, including family owned companies, setting up in-house banks, or broader SSCs, to centralise and bring greater efficiency to their treasury function.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, although the UAE ticks all the boxes in terms of infrastructure for telecommunications and travel, access to resources, political stability and lifestyle, that does not preclude other countries in the region from attracting SSCs. In fact, I know companies that have regional treasuries in Bahrain and Oman, for example. All of these locations offer a tax-free environment and are favourably placed from a time zone perspective to deal with both European and Asian operations. So we are seeing more and more treasury SSCs being established in MENA.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we are also seeing more Asian companies come to the region – not just to set up SSCs, but in terms of extending their general operations. Previously, the main influx of foreign companies was from the West. The quality of goods being produced by Asian companies has increased dramatically in recent years and this has helped them to gain traction. Asian companies are also more likely to enter riskier markets than their Western counterparts. We are therefore seeing a number of Korean, Japanese and Chinese companies coming into this region and around 50% of the large EPC contracts are now being awarded to Asian MNCs.</p>
<h5 id="is-there-a-growing-call-for-the-use-of-renminbi-rmb-among-your-client-base">With Asian MNCs gaining a good foothold in the region, is there a growing call for the use of renminbi (RMB) among your client base?</h5>
<p>Absolutely – the RMB is a huge focus for our clients, and for HSBC as a bank. As an institution, we have a major presence in all RMB centres, including Hong Kong, which means that we have enough RMB liquidity to cater for any client’s requirements. In addition to handling the currency, we also offer RMB advisory services. Given that the RMB is a relatively new currency, a number of corporates are looking to discover the best way to settle trades in RMB. At HSBC, we have a team of consultants who can assist clients to switch from their previous trade settlement currency to using RMB.</p>
<h5 id="what-do-you-expect-to-be-speaking-with-clients-about-whilst-there">You will be opening the EuroFinance Dubai conference at the end of March. Why are conferences such as these so important and what do you expect to be speaking with clients about whilst there?</h5>
<p>Being present at industry conferences provides an independent forum through which we can demonstrate thought leadership and help clients to understand new developments in the market.</p>
<p>Topics that are high on regional treasurers’ minds at the moment include counterparty risk and bank relationship management. Companies don’t want to have to manage ten different bank relationships across ten different countries – the amount of time spent on filling in each bank’s KYC documentation alone is a real negative for treasurers. At the same time, corporates are looking to minimise their counterparty risk. Since HSBC has a strong credit rating and balance sheet, and has a global footprint, we will no doubt be speaking with corporates looking to consolidate their banking relationships.</p>
<p>Other topics of conversation are likely to include SEPA, for those companies with European operations, and the RMB for those trading with Asia. Of course, any conversation about MENA wouldn’t be complete without mentioning the UAE’s Expo 2020 and Qatar winning the honour of hosting the World Cup in 2022.</p>
<p>Going forward, we will see significant investment taking place in the infrastructure of these countries, which can only be positive for businesses located there. These events will also have a positive impact on the tourism trade and the amount of FDI coming into the UAE and Qatar. Naturally, HSBC will continue to work closely with our corporate clients to help them leverage this growth to their advantage.</p></div>

</div>
<h5 id="what-are-the-major-trade-and-cash-management-challenges-facing-corporate-treasurers-in-europe-today">What are the major trade and cash management challenges facing corporate treasurers in Europe today?</h5>
<p>The primary issue facing corporate treasurers is still related to the twin challenges of addressing the continued slow growth macroeconomic environment in the region, and an increasingly slower growth trajectory in the emerging markets. While we are beginning to see tentative signs of recovery in some regions, we are seeing slower growth in key emerging markets such as China and India, when compared to growth patterns over the last ten years. However, concentrating on their home region, there is still a great deal of uncertainty coming from governments and central banks. Such uncertainty is not conducive to corporate investment and is therefore impeding a faster recovery, as companies are seeing higher shareholder returns allocating investment capital to faster growing regions outside the European Union (EU). Companies in Europe, coming out of the recent economic crisis, have adopted a strategy to protect principal and have accumulated substantial amounts of liquidity on their balance sheets. As markets slowly improve, their companies are seeking to deploy that capital either through M&amp;A activities, as a means to acquire market share, investments in new plant and equipment to enhance productivity, or by returning cash to shareholders through dividend repurchases. Along with these strategies, revenue growth remains central to their goals, along with the need to manage the financial and operational risks as they expand further into new markets. So, when we discuss with our clients their core strategies for 2014, cost minimisation, productivity gains, supply chain management and working capital management remain essential underpinnings in this environment.</p>
<p>Our clients, be they corporates, financial institutions, or public sector leverage Citi TTS’ global liquidity platforms in order to manage costs and mitigate risks including operational, settlement and counterparty risks. In Western Europe, the dominant issue at the moment is Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) compliance. The recent announcement to extend the transition period for six months from 1<sup>st</sup> February 2014, will help major utilities with their migration to SEPA transaction formats. Most corporate clients have been addressing SEPA readiness for the past 12 months. The extension is likely to require continued acceptance of legacy transactions types and therefore maintain dual transaction processes (and dual costs), however the countries have adopted different positions, complicating matters for those who are not fully compliant yet. This will need to be monitored closely by companies. We are feeling comfortable about where we are. Most of our customers have either migrated successfully, or are on schedule to do so this month.</p>
<p>The lack of preparedness in other areas of the market is most concerning. Firstly, too many SMEs – within our client’s supply chain – and some of the smaller local banks are not yet fully compliant and this will present substantive inefficiencies for those transacting with those companies or banks. Secondly, we are seeing local nuances of SEPA in different countries which runs against the spirit of SEPA. The original objective was to facilitate the movement of capital by harmonising pan-European schemes for credit transfers and direct debits, however this may have been sacrificed along the journey. Some of the markets have maintained local transaction codes and discrete processes which was not the intention of the Payment Services Directive (PSD). Nevertheless, our message to corporates is that you cannot postpone the inevitable. Sooner or later the legacy systems will be switched off and companies who have not migrated by that point will be caught in a really unenviable position.</p>
<p>Some domestic payroll service providers have also been slow in their preparations for SEPA and this will be a concern when the final deadline for adoption of SCT arrives. SEPA presents an excellent opportunity to look at payroll processing for improved efficiencies and reducing operational risk and costs. Moreover, Payroll is one area that has traditionally been the domain of the human resources department, but is now viewed as an area that would benefit from corporate treasury’s guidance in ensuring the proper controls exist around the payment process, including cross-border payments for expats, and even in the selection of payroll service providers.</p>
<h5 id="what-support-is-citi-providing-its-clients-in-terms-of-regulatory-compliance">How do you see the regulatory landscape in Europe developing in 2014, and what support is Citi providing its clients in terms of regulatory compliance?</h5>
<p>The regulatory environment remains very challenging for banks and corporates; Basel III, SEPA, European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) plus additional local regulatory changes, including more capital controls. Our clients benefit from our global knowledge and strong industry alliances with regulators, infrastructures and associations. We’ve recently issued a Global Regulatory Guide to provide clients with updates on major regulatory developments, and address issues and implications for corporates. Additionally, we maintain Country Regulatory Guides with local regulatory information and market practices and share these globally with our clients.</p>
<p>In relation to the increase in regulatory requirements, one of the outcomes has been the acceleration of corporate treasurers improving the visibility and control over bank accounts. Those that have not started yet are well advised to design a game plan with their banking partners because all the key stakeholders – regulators, tax authorities, corporate boards, shareholders – are demanding greater visibility, as well as enhanced reporting related to anti-money laundering and know your customer activities. The fact that regulation is increasing the focus on transparency is a global trend and not one which is necessarily exclusive to the banking sector. It is also reflected in demands from regulators and clients, for greater transparency in transaction content and pricing. Some of the payment systems were prone to abbreviating or cutting off some of that information. But now some of the regulators are requiring more complete issuer and beneficiary details in messages. Of course, ISO XML will address to an extent this issue of data truncation, especially in SEPA countries, and will have the added benefit of improving identification and facilitating straight through reconciliation.</p>
<p>Corporate treasurers also want greater transparency and efficiency around invoicing for bank services. Some companies are asking their banking partners to provide TWIST BSB statements in ISO XML format or other electronic formats to expedite the reconciliation of invoices. We have been working on this at Citi and we are now able to provide invoices in electronic formats throughout most of our more than 100 country network.</p>
<h5 id="what-services-does-citi-offer-clients-to-help-them-improve-their-wcm">What services does Citi offer clients to help them improve their working capital management (WCM)?</h5>
<p>Improving the cash conversion cycle and working capital management remains the key priority. At Citi, we offer clients bespoke solutions to help companies optimise their working capital management. For corporate treasurers embarking on such initiatives, we recommend benchmarking your company to your peers as a first step. Citi Treasury Diagnostics is a tool we developed for corporate treasurers to compare on a confidential basis their current treasury and finance practices with other companies in their industry to identify areas for improvement. Based on the results and the corporate’s objectives, we’ll then recommend solutions that might encompass liquidity management structures, trade finance, transaction processing optimisation, and corporate card programmes. Once compliance is achieved, SEPA presents an opportunity to improve working capital management by simplifying cash forecasting thanks to the consistent value-dating that will be applied for SEPA Credit Transfer (SCT) and SEPA Direct Debit (SDD) transactions.</p>
<p>Many clients have implemented our regional or global commercial cards programmes to improve working capital. At the simplest level, cards provide visibility, transparency and control over expenses and procurement by turning variable outflows into predictable cash flows. But procurement cards (p-cards) can add additional value by streamlining the procure-to-pay process and reducing the cost of procuring low-value items. Studies have shown that the cost for a requisition, purchase order, invoice and payment can range between $50 and $75 per transaction. P-cards can reduce that cost by eliminating the requisition, purchase order and invoicing element.</p>
<p>However, travel cards play an even greater role in the emerging markets. In China, for example, total business travel expenditure has been estimated at over $150 billion per annum. It’s a big problem for companies today as they have little control or visibility over travel expenditures. Citi rolled out its commercial cards programme in China about a year ago, the first global bank to do so. Initially it was challenging due to local regulations but now there are many companies using our cards and we see significant demand in the market for such solutions.</p>
<h5 id="what-opportunities-is-this-process-opening-up-for-multinationals-in-china">What opportunities is this process opening up for multinationals in China?</h5>
<p>When I first arrived in China, everybody thought it would take at least 15 to 20 years to see renminbi internationalisation. The reality is that it is going faster than anybody predicted, although there is still some way to go before we can expect to see full capital account liberalisation.</p>
<p>China remains a complex market but it is one which corporates need to watch closely. Early adoption is important. Companies should take advantage of the new reforms and the pilot programmes being introduced by the Chinese regulators who want to see participation.</p>
<p>The issue of trapped cash in China is not entirely solved but there is definite progress. Multinationals can now move excess cash out of China in RMB by loaning it to another group company. Regulatory approval is no longer required. The next step is to automate the process by pooling and target-balancing, and we are working on new solutions to leverage the reforms in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone (SFTZ).</p>
<p>For corporates in China, converting inter-company and even third-party cross-border payments to renminbi should be considered. The benefits of this approach are significant; it allows companies to centralise and aggregate foreign exchange exposures from local operating companies to centres of expertise, simplify and automate the payment processes as reduced supporting documentation is required, and improve management of RMB and foreign-currency liquidity from faster payment cycle timeframes.</p>
<h5 id="how-can-banks-support-corporates-as-they-expand-in-emerging-markets">How can banks support corporates as they expand in emerging markets?</h5>
<p>What global banks bring to the table is a strong partner for corporates, one which understands their business, how they operate and can then link the company to the local market in an efficient and compliant manner. Additionally, Citi’s Treasury and Trade Solutions network spanning more than 100 countries provides clients a consistent technology backbone, which helps clients control their investment spend. I spent much of my time in Asia explaining to clients how to best manage treasury in China and, how that compares to what we do in Europe and North America. For example, there is a lot of talk in China at the moment about payments-on-behalf-of (POBO) and receivables-on-behalf-of (ROBO).</p>
<p>However the permitted uses of POBO and ROBO in China are different to how the same techniques are used in Europe or North America. Global banks add value in the translation between East and West. We use the knowledge of our clients to adapt solutions to fit within their broader goals and objectives. Really, it is all about connecting the clients and the markets to make it easier for corporates to navigate the globe.</p>
<h5 id="you-have-spoken-about-the-need-for-best-fit-technology-but-what-does-this-mean-for-treasurers">You have spoken about the need for ‘best-fit’ technology, but what does this mean for treasurers?</h5>
<p>We all acknowledge companies operate with complex organisational structures, cultures, and geographical footprints and therefore have different treasury technology requirements. Even within companies it is often the case that there are business units with different ERP platforms or different business processes. Clearly one solution doesn’t fit all and for that reason we see companies maintaining multiple connectivity solutions. Treasury and major business units may be using SWIFTNet or host-to-host connectivity with XML file formats, but then there are always outliers in the business that cannot be integrated onto the main platform. That’s not a problem as long as the platforms provide the functionality and integration needed along with strong security. Treasurers should maintain their efforts on achieving visibility and implementing proper controls. Fortunately, we offer a broad range of connectivity solutions that can accommodate the needs of complex organisations. Connectivity remains an area in which we continue to invest.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-the-signs-that-the-mobile-model-is-beginning-to-gain-wider-acceptance-in-the-treasury-community">Citi has an ongoing mobile solutions programme, but what are the signs that the mobile model is beginning to gain wider acceptance in the treasury community?</h5>
<p>We’re tracking activity on our mobile solutions and we’re seeing strong momentum. As of Q4 2013, TTS processed $115 trillion in payments actioned using CitiDirect BE Mobile. This technology is going to be liberating for treasury managers.</p>
<p>We announced CitiDirect BE Tablet at EuroFinance in Barcelona last year and I am really impressed with what has been achieved. It’s been designed for senior treasury and finance managers to provide anytime, anywhere access to data to support decision-making and action single and batch payment approvals. So far, treasurers who have seen our new app in action see value in the added productivity that this financial tool will bring.</p></div>

<p>When I ran Asia Pacific treasury for a western multinational, BADs and CADs were a real headache – ‘bad’ news indeed.</p>
<p>BAD is the acronym for Bank Acceptance Draft and CAD is the acronym for Commercial Acceptance Draft. They are sometimes called BAN and CAN ie Bank Acceptance Note and Commercial Acceptance Note; and sometimes called BAB and CAB ie Bank Acceptance Bill and Commercial Acceptance Bill.</p>
<p>Bank Acceptance Draft Discount – 星展银 行中国- 个人银行、中小企业</p>
<p>银行 = bank = Yínháng</p>
<p>承兑 = acceptances = Chéngduì</p>
<p>汇票 = draft = Huìpiào</p>
<p>BADs and CADs are basically bills of exchange issued respectively by banks and commercial companies in China. It might sound similar to BAs that banks discount with their respective central banks in the west, but their usage and effects are very different.</p>
<p>BADs and CADs are essentially promises to pay by the issuer. It sounds fair enough. Something akin to the promissory notes that have been helpful in Korea. But this belies the considerable issues these instruments have created in China.</p>
<p>BADs and CADs are legally and regulatory recognised transferrable instruments. Unlike for instance fapiaos – tax invoices – which are not transferrable (thus stymying factoring and receivable sales in China). As such BADs and CADs have oiled the wheels of China domestic commerce for decades.</p>
<p>I can hear readers lighting up with the supply chain finance possibilities of these instruments. And yes, BADs and CADSs can be and are used for supply chain finance and much more besides. But remember these are paper instruments in an often chaotic developing market. BADs and CADs have caused considerable systemic and operational risk in China.</p>
<p>Although the so called shadow banking system in China – mainly wealth management products sold by banks through off balance sheet vehicles to get around the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) mandated deposit and lending rates – has been more in the news recently, longer-term China watchers will be familiar with the term triangular debt. This recycling of corporate obligations, often without final settlement, has thrived on the basis of BADs and CADs.</p>
<p>Since BADs and CADs are transferrable and endorsable, companies would pay their suppliers with BADs and CADs collected from their customers – putting a whole new spin on supply chain financing. Instead of clean bank transfers, you would see accounts receivable converted into a thick wad of BADs and CADs of dubious quality. Naturally, you would want to pass them on as quickly as possible. It became a dangerous national game of pass the parcel.</p>
<p>Because BADs and CADs were paper instruments, they have been hard to track at a national level, driving significant levels of systemic risk in China. In an attempt to control this risk, PBOC has mandated a maximum six month tenor for BADs and CADs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When I first learned about ECDS, I enthusiastically signed up as a pilot. I was very excited when I heard that PBOC would soon ban paper drafts and force business to move to EDCS once it had stabilised the platform.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their paper form and the Chinese predilection for chops drives massive operational risk in BADs and CADs. Simply put, it is extremely difficult to verify that the BAD/CAD you receive is indeed valid. Even the original issuing chop was hard to verify, especially if it came from a remote location. Even the four state banks had difficulty verifying chops from their own remote branches. And this was compounded by often long chains of transfer endorsements.</p>
<p>I ended up with a policy decision to discount all BADs and CADs received immediately – even for good names whose credit we were comfortable with – simply to address the operational risk of fraud on these instruments. This was expensive and difficult. In some cases impossible. So material collections had to be approved by our banks in advance with confirmation that we could sell the BADs and CADs with which customers proposed to settle. This was extremely painful because – especially in China where collecting accounts receivable can be challenging – you do not want to refuse your customers offer to pay, whatever the format.</p>
<p>In addition to the external operational risks described above, companies find BADs and CADs very hard to manage internally. Sales people may receive them in person from customers. What should they do to them? China is a big country. Do you trust local courier services? Do you trust your own people not to try to cash the drafts and claim they were lost? At best it is a lengthy and administratively costly process which materially delays converting accounts receivable to cash.</p>
<p>The sheer volume of paper involved in this has driven a profitable service from banks called BAD warehousing, which is analogous to the (equally odd) lockbox system for cheques in the USA.</p>
<p>Since negotiable drafts are useful in trade flows, we would not want to eliminate BADs and CADs altogether. The obvious solution is to make them electronic. This is exactly what PBOC concluded a few years ago. They launched Electronic Commercial Drafts System – an online platform to replace the legacy paper BADs and CADs. When I first learned about ECDS, I enthusiastically signed up as a pilot. I was very excited when I heard that PBOC would soon ban paper drafts and force business to move to EDCS once it had stabilised the platform. This is not implausible in China, but it has not happened yet.</p>
<p>Five years on, paper is still the majority sport. Banks still profit from BAD warehousing and discounting to manage the multiplicities of paper risk. But I am heartened by two big developments.</p>
<p>First, instead of the blank (and often incredulous) looks I used to get a few years ago, treasurers mostly know what I am talking about when I ask about ECDS. Better still, large numbers of treasurers are using ECDS, most in conjunction with warehousing for the old paper habit they have not yet been able to kick fully.</p>
<p>Second, although PBOC has not yet banned paper, they are heading in the right direction with incentives. Paper drafts are limited by PBOC regulation to a maximum six month tenor. ECDS drafts can go up to 12 months. This is a significant benefit, especially in China where access to credit can be erratic, and I believe it will speed the move from paper to electronic.</p>
<p>ECDS puts China ahead of most western countries by providing a nationwide platform for safe and reliable negotiable commercial drafts that will drive supply chain finance across the country that is home to the world’s biggest and most extensive commercial supply chains.</p>
<p>I believe the demand is there – it is no coincidence that China is an early and leading adopter of SWIFT’s TSU/BPO solution for cross-border trade. The awareness is building according to my anecdotal inputs. And the regulators are nudging this along consistently.</p>
<p>If ECDS piggy backs the internationalisation of CNY/CNH, then it might become the world’s favourite way of conducting international trade. Why not? UnionPay is showing the way in consumer settlement.</p></div>

<br/>
<p>Hugo Parry-Wingfield is the Investment Director and EMEA Head of Liquidity Product for HSBC Global Asset Management. Based in the UK, he has responsibility for the development and implementation of the liquidity product strategy in EMEA. Parry-Wingfield joined HSBC Global Asset Management in August 2013 and has been working in the cash management and liquidity industry for over 15 years. He joined from Citibank’s Treasury and Trade Solutions business, where he was Co-Head of EMEA Liquidity and Investment Products and Head of Liquidity Market Management. Prior to that Parry-Wingfield held senior liquidity sales, product management and consultancy positions at J.P. Morgan and at PwC.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="why-is-liquidity-a-key-area-of-focus-for-hsbc">Why is liquidity a key area of focus for HSBC?</h5>
<p>Liquidity is the lifeblood of any company, and its management has consistently topped the corporate treasurer’s agenda over the past five years, both from a risk as well as a utility perspective. In order to protect their company’s business, treasurers need to know where their cash is and how quickly they can access it. They need both visibility and control.</p>
<p>HSBC is responding to our clients’ key requirement for effective liquidity management, by servicing them across all the markets we are present in, and providing a range of services to support their liquidity management activities. This core competency stretches across the whole Group, including HSBC Global Asset Management.</p>
<h5 id="based-on-feedback-from-your-clients-what-are-the-biggest-challenges-facing-corporate-treasurers-in-todays-environment">Based on feedback from your clients, what are the biggest challenges facing corporate treasurers in today’s environment?</h5>
<p>The risk of a loss of principal due to a counterparty default has not gone away and, therefore, the importance of robust investment policies and processes is as important today as it ever was. Protecting a company’s capital requires the ability to mitigate counterparty risk as best as they can.</p>
<p>A closely associated challenge is the ability to effectively diversify cash without diluting core investment principles. Today, corporates are sitting on historically high levels of cash, which clearly puts greater pressure on their investment policies and underlying liquidity management principles.</p>
<p>The changing regulatory environment is having a direct impact on corporates, as well as indirectly via banks and service providers. Although many incoming regulations are intended to benefit business, the pace and diversity of change is making the job much more difficult. For those corporates operating in multiple jurisdictions, treasurers are tasked with navigating complex and divergent regulatory environments.</p>
<p>The growing footprint of most corporate operations is another challenge. Clearly, this is a positive driver for change, as corporates are actively taking advantage of new market opportunities; however, it is creating new challenges for treasurers expanding their cash management operations into new markets and currencies. Above all, a consistent global risk-managed environment is best practice.</p>
<p>The low interest rate environment has also continued to be a challenge and is expected to persist for some time. Clearly this environment provides limited, if any, reward for cash. But on the other hand, it is driving best practice in terms of risk management if there is less focus on yield and greater focus on risk.</p>
<p>Getting the balance right in managing their access to liquidity, both in terms of meeting near-term cash flow needs and also being prudent when investing cash, due to concerns about what might be coming around the corner, is a growing challenge for many of our clients. But remember, holding ultra-liquid cash can come at a cost.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-these-challenges-begin-to-change-treasurers-behaviour-particularly-with-regards-to-their-investment-strategies-and-policies">How do these challenges begin to change treasurers’ behaviour, particularly with regards to their investment strategies and policies?</h5>
<p>The market events over the past five to six years have fundamentally changed the investment environment. The decisions a treasurer has to take today are not the same as they were during the earlier phases of the financial crisis, let alone before the crisis.</p>
<p>Therefore, first and foremost, it is important to constantly evaluate investment policy – which includes the mechanics, process and strategy, as well as the written policy – to ensure its relevance. In addition, building a deep analysis of counterparty risk and classes of investment allocations, much more than previously and well beyond external credit ratings, is a key to success. The problem treasurers often come up against is that it is not easy for a treasury team to achieve this level of scrutiny, because they don’t necessarily have the resources or expertise.</p>
<p>Today, treasurers are putting more emphasis on segmenting their liquidity profile. Essentially this is based on a better understanding and profiling of their own liquidity, as it relates to their balances around the world and, more importantly, as it relates to their cash flows in and out, that generate that daily position. In response, many banks have been developing more flexible products, such as flexible call accounts – which are deposit products that reward stability with higher yields but still give the treasurer access to liquidity.</p>
<p>On the asset management side, as an add-on to their money market fund allocations, some clients are expressing greater interest in segregated mandates to better deploy cash in line with liquidity profiles, as well as seeking incremental yield, where available, compared to shorter-term options.</p>
<p>We also see increased demand for alternatives to traditional deposits, such as repos. An increasing number of treasurers are interested in using repos to enhance security, using collateral to underpin an otherwise unsecured deposit. Repos also provide opportunity for different yield profiles, so a treasurer could potentially enhance their yield over a normal short-term deposit depending on the collateral used.</p>
<p>In addition, clients continue to look for ways to automate investments, where possible, in order to ensure they are maximising the amount of cash deployed into their chosen investment strategy, in a controlled environment. For example, some are using daily automated sweeps from cash accounts or cash pools into money market funds (MMFs). This effectively links their cash and liquidity management activities with their end-of-day investments.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-think-the-proposed-money-market-fund-regulations-will-affect-where-corporates-place-their-cash">How do you think the proposed money market fund regulations will affect where corporates place their cash?</h5>
<p>In the US and Europe the regulatory changes have yet to be finalised, so it would be premature to conclude how they will change treasurers’ behaviour, and we should keep in mind that it may be several years until any actual implementation. That said, HSBC supports regulatory proposals that aim to deliver a more robust or secure environment for MMFs and investors. We are engaging with the regulators, politicians and governments on both sides of the Atlantic, especially where we believe the changes will achieve greater stability in the market. In addition, we are providing feedback where we think that the proposals, as written, will not achieve the goals described by the regulators themselves or in some cases, where they could even have the opposite effect.</p>
<p>We do not expect the proposed reforms will remove the utility value that MMFs have provided to investors; professional credit management, credit diversification, a high degree of liquidity, a competitive return compared to short-term money market interest rates, and a high degree of transparency, all achieved through one transaction. For this reason we believe that investors will continue to use MMFs as part of their day-to-day cash investment needs. If the proposals are implemented, including any move to a floating net asset value, or a removal of external ratings paid for by the funds, then investors will rightly need to consider the implications.</p>
<p>HSBC is working with its clients to help them address these issues. Although we can’t have all the answers at present because it remains a moving target, we do, and will continue to, provide analysis and information to help investors make informed decisions at the appropriate time, as well as develop solutions that could help mitigate some of the impact to an investment process.</p>
<h5 id="the-tough-environment-is-also-affecting-the banks-what-should-corporates-be-aware-of">The tough environment is also affecting the banks – what should corporates be aware of?</h5>
<p>As well as numerous other demands, banks require significant resources to prepare for Basel III. Basel III’s new capital rules clearly influence the banks’ preference for different types of deposits. Already some banks are aligning their options against the deposits that have the best liquidity treatment – which affects how they price and position specific types of deposits, and to which types of clients.</p>
<p>MMFs are not directly affected by Basel III, as they are off balance sheet and not a capital-based investment product. However, the industry is facing its own regulatory reform, as mentioned previously.</p>
<h5 id="how-should-investors-consider-counterparty-risk-specifically">How should investors consider counterparty risk specifically?</h5>
<p>Most corporate investment policies remain heavily weighted towards bank deposits, which means counterparty risk must be closely managed. Yet maintaining adequate lines with the highest quality counterparties continues to be a challenge, especially at a time when corporate liquidity continues to be historically high. Investment quality should be independent of a change in size of liquidity – eg it is recommended that treasurers should not take more risks, raise limits beyond previous tolerances, or use banks they previously avoided just because they have more cash to deploy.</p>
<p>Many corporates have not changed their attitudes to core relationship banks and also ‘national champion’ banks, or large domestic banks. The historic rationale behind this is that treasurers want to, rightly, ‘reward’ their relationship banks with deposits, but they also might think that they have some leverage with their relationship banks should a problem arise. Equally, the logic behind using a national champion bank is the perception that they are ‘too big to fail’ or that there is a high degree of likelihood that the government would step in to save the bank and protect its investors or deposit holders.</p>
<p>Yet, the political and regulatory landscape is changing. Much of the regulators focus is on putting in place processes to allow a bank to fail. But the focus of these new ‘bail in’ regulations is often geared to protect retail investors, rather than institutional investors, such as corporates.</p>
<p>It is no longer reasonable to make the assumption that investments are safe, either due to the relationship or the national position of the bank. Therefore, investors may need to rethink and revisit their policies and ensure the counterparty selection is first and foremost based on credit quality, before the lens of relationship is applied.</p>
<h5 id="so-how-are-treasurers-adjusting-their-credit-analysis-in-order-to-respond-to-this-new-environment">So how are treasurers adjusting their credit analysis in order to respond to this new environment?</h5>
<p>Most investors active in the money markets have made great progress since the financial crisis, in enhancing investment policies and risk management. However, when assessing counterparty risk, some continue to predominantly use external credit ratings.</p>
<p>Although ratings are a useful reference point, analysis of a counterparty’s credit quality needs to be supplemented with other inputs, for example financial statements, asset quality, historic and projected earnings, and liquidity and funding mix. These are key elements HSBC uses for selecting and monitoring our counterparties within MMFs specifically, and more generally across our investment teams.</p>
<p>Credit analysis is not just a one-off activity aimed solely at putting a counterparty on an investment list, but additionally, they should be regularly monitored. Once a counterparty is approved, there needs to be an ongoing assessment as to the appropriateness of that counterparty, and its corresponding limits; HSBC believes this should be done on a daily basis and adjustments made accordingly.</p>
<p>All this requires resources and expertise. Many treasurers see the advantages to using a professional investor whose job it is to manage risks and liquidity, has scale and expertise to fully understand issuers and instruments from many angles and the ability to apply their own scoring and monitoring, transacts volume in the market daily and operates within the boundaries of a robust policy with sufficient flexibility to adapt to changing risks day-by-day.</p>
<h5 id="how-can-treasurers-develop-a-more-consistent-global-approach-to-their-investment-policy">How can treasurers develop a more consistent global approach to their investment policy?</h5>
<p>A key aim of many treasurers is to have a consistent global approach to liquidity management. Moving into new markets presents a challenge in integrating the new market and currency into a controlled treasury environment, which may have been in place for many years across more established markets. Local practices can create a further layer of confusion. Therefore, a treasurer might look to leverage a global bank’s presence in a new market and plug into its existing framework in order to achieve the visibility and control they desire.</p>
<p>This is also true on the investment side. A global asset manager that has capabilities in different markets and currencies can provide a level of consistency in a treasurer’s approach through using the same underlying investment standards, processes and risk management framework that the asset manager provides in other markets. Investors are, for example, looking for more investment options in markets such as China and India, as well as across Latin America.</p>
<p>There is so much going on in the cash investing world, facing the investors directly and the markets they serve, as well as the banks and asset managers who provide much of the solutions. This is driving innovation – new products, currencies, and so on – and providing increasing choice; however, investors must continue to focus on the fundamentals and evaluate what they are equipped to manage themselves as opposed to where there is value in using an external manager. Either way, any decision should be a thoroughly deliberated one that is reviewed on a regular basis.</p></div>

<p>Technology as an enabler is very much how it should be. Within Danske Bank this view is a fundamental belief driving an approach to solution, process and service delivery that, combined with a unique advisory methodology, places it ahead of the pack. Erik Zingmark, Global Head of Cash Management, SVP at Danske Bank, explains the rationale.</p>
<h5 id="can-you-define-what-it-is-that-sits-at-the-heart-of-danske-banks-philosophy">Can you define what it is that sits at the heart of Danske Bank’s philosophy and how this approach influences your cash management offering?</h5>
<p>Danske Bank is a bank with a long history, having been around in one form or another for more than 140 years. Being a Danish bank it also has a strong tradition of trade and, like the country itself, we cover a lot of ground with a small footprint. From an early stage we understood the importance of having sophisticated technology and took a major decision almost 20 years ago to deliver upon that understanding, giving us that reach with one technology platform.</p>
<p>Coming to Danske Bank in January 2013 has enabled me to fully appreciate the implications for the bank and for our customers of having this one real-time technology platform; it gives economies of scale that are seldom found in other banks, it provides a quicker time to market for products and services and it allows us to provide solutions to customers that are more bespoke than they would normally expect to find, simply because we can make the changes in one place for all the markets in which we are present.</p>
<p>This can come as a surprise to customers, especially those with a parent company or group treasury outside of our part of the world. A truly multinational company may look at Northern Europe or the Baltic rim and see almost ten of everything – from legislation to regulation, from language to currency and so on. But then they find they can operate – transferring and receiving data and even from a terms and conditions perspective – through one point of entry with Danske Bank. It can be a genuine positive moment for them to realise our technology and our service which, as a mid-sized bank, is genuinely based around the formation of longer-term relationships, can help them become more efficient, lower their costs and be more flexible.</p>
<p>It can be extremely difficult for banks of all sizes to make this kind of leap forward with service and technology, especially in today’s environment. But Danske Bank took that difficult decision to centralise on a single platform and it paid off; we have created, and continue to create, a lot of opportunities for our customers and ourselves.</p>
<p>The discussion around tailoring cash management solutions for customers scared me at first because I always equated it to high cost and high operational risk. But I have learnt that because of this technology we can do it in an efficient and risk-controlled way, and work for the customer across the entire wholesale division.</p>
<p>In essence then, our success is achieved through a unique technology platform across our markets and a customer-centric approach. This ensures that we cater for customers in an ‘holistic’ manner. As a wholesale bank we offer solutions for customers within a wide range of areas and solve tasks ranging from the highest complexity to the most basic transaction, and all points in between.</p>
<p>However, it is our belief that we create most value when the relationship with the customers goes beyond single transactions to becoming long-term partnerships. In that way our ability to discuss strategic matters, the quality of our products and our advisory and solutions-based services give the maximum benefit to the customer.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-the-process-of-discovery-you-use-to-find-most-appropriate-opportunities-and-solutions-for-customers">Given the depth and breadth – and the unified approach to your offering, what is the process of discovery you use to find most appropriate opportunities and solutions for customers?</h5>
<p>Our driving ambition is to have a long-term relationship with the customer where they are open with their targets and strategy, especially around treasury and the financial processes of the company. That open dialogue is necessary in order for us to understand their pain-points and the opportunities that lie within. We have established an advisory methodology where we run through the different processes of the treasury – ‘walking the process’ – which has at least two unique features. The first is that we do not provide the customer with a generic financial value-chain as the starting point for the discussion but instead we together establish the key aspects of the customer’s value-chain, exactly how they work and how they will work in the future and thereby also the opportunities which should be realised. We will then run through a number of questions to establish where the customer is in terms of quality and efficiency within these operations. Once we have made that assessment, the customer will be able to benchmark their processes against best-in-class if they wish.</p>
<p>With all this information we are able to deliver the second unique feature and that is quantifying the benefits of these improvements and stating how much effort will be required to achieve them – an R.O.I approach. We want to put numbers to our claims, to make them real, but they could be realised in a number of ways such as stronger financial net, release of tied-up capital, lower IT costs, number of staff needed etc. We know that cash management initiatives within companies have not always been top of the agenda.</p>
<p>The financial crisis has pushed it to the forefront but if treasury is able to submit hard numbers for return on investment, a stronger business case is immediately created. With agreement, we establish a joint agenda with the customer defining the responsibilities of both parties from the outset. To see the process through, we look for a shared commitment to quickly realise each step, but every customer is different so timing varies accordingly.</p>
<h5 id="does-the-danske-bank-methodology-influence-the-way-in-which-you-manage-the-rising-tide-of-regulation">Does the Danske Bank methodology influence the way in which you manage the rising tide of regulation, particularly where it impacts upon corporate customers?</h5>
<p>We have strategic dialogue with the customer to look at opportunities to improve processes, where we discuss industry events such as regulatory change. As a bank we are of course ready for SEPA but with our customers we have chosen to focus on the opportunities that it can present, not the disasters that may befall them if they don’t comply. SEPA has been discussed in the industry for so long people have switched off, even as the deadline fast approaches. We are delivering to those that are ready and helping those that aren’t because there is no upside to scaring our customers. We explain that having a harmonised and streamlined payments infrastructure is a great opportunity to improve efficiency.</p>
<p>The whole process falls into line with the Danske Bank philosophy of using technology to achieve the most appropriate solution and part of what we offer, born out of that, is true real-time information. This means our customers have full control of liquidity, which is a vital source of efficiency on the corporate side, especially nowadays.</p>
<h5 id="what-does-this-mean-for-the-customer">Your transaction banking unit set up is characterised by use of virtual teams – what does this mean for the customer?</h5>
<p>There has been a trend in transaction banking for many years where banks have been searching for a ‘magic recipe’ that will allow them to organise themselves around the customer’s need. I’ve always been sceptical of that quest; there are customers where both trade finance and cash management is core or businesses where custody and cash is core. But there are even more companies where cash and FX are twins; each need is very different and it is almost impossible to rigidly organise a bank’s units to meet every customer’s individual needs. So I think it is a mistake to try and organise and move people around because the world is changing constantly; there is uncertainty in the market and events can happen so fast it is hard to keep up.</p>
<p>But Danske Bank has organised its entire transaction banking unit to be very flexible, enabling us to look at a customer’s specific needs and then work together as one team to meet those needs. This goes for the transaction banking product areas, but also along the delivery chain where the daily customer support is a key component to keep our customers satisfied. That is also true for the way the entire wholesale banking division operates. It means we do not have to constantly think about how we are organised to meet customer expectations. It really is much better for customers that we, as a provider, can quickly adapt to their specific needs at any time.</p>
<p>If we broaden out this flexible and co-operative model to the industry, I believe significant improvements could be made for all parties. One aspect of banking that often surprises me is how, with all the regulations being imposed, many banks are still trying to address them individually; there is very limited discussion on how, without limiting competition, we can co-operate on non-core processes and investments. The airline industry has a number of major alliances around shared infrastructure. Banking has occasional partnerships springing up and Danske Bank has what we call our ‘Network Extension’ scheme giving customers one point of entry across numerous countries, aside from the 13 we cover with our own branches. But if we look at SEPA preparations in Europe, there are thousands of banks making the same individual investment, pouring money into the same commoditised services.</p>
<p>It need not be like this. It is an ambition here at Danske Bank to find new, simple and streamlined ways of increasing geographical reach for our home-market customers using smart, industry-aligned thinking. SWIFT and global IT companies have a role to play here, but it is something banks seriously need to discuss. I think the solution will be found in what I call a ‘rent infrastructure’. Under a reciprocal agreement, and of course without impacting rules of competition, banks could agree to access each other’s infrastructure in a seamless way to complete a transaction, with the initiating bank taking care of everything under its own brand so as not to confuse the customer. It is complicated to make it work, but the banking industry needs to be smarter to solve customers’ problems. Other industries have.</p>
<h5 id="how-will-it-shape-the-future-of-treasury">Given the obvious importance of technology, how will it shape the future of treasury – or does treasury shape the future of technology?</h5>
<p>Danske Bank’s ‘One Group – One System’ concept, which describes our single technology platform across all the countries in which we operate, has shaped the course of our IT strategy for several years now. It has certainly been one of the cornerstones for our growth through acquisition and integration of other financial services providers. But also I believe the technology platform differentiates us from our Nordic – and perhaps even northern European – peers, and allows us to offer unique solutions to our customers, such as true real-time cross-border cash pooling.</p>
<p>Treasuries today are justifiably very demanding when it comes to technology. The right technology allows for a higher degree of process automation, standardisation and communication with partners, including banks. At Danske Bank, we believe that customers should be involved in shaping the future of technology. Earlier this year we ran a series of round tables in the Nordic region, inviting treasurers to tell us what they may need in the coming years so that we know we are focusing development in the right places.</p>
<p>Treasurers increasingly take on assignments within their companies and having ready access to data can be vital for these projects. The real-time information that we can deliver can, for example, reduce the need for intraday credit lines – and credit lines in general – by giving quicker access to information for forecasting liquidity requirements. It will thereby enable a stronger financial net of the company. By knowing the targets and KPIs of the treasury, we are trying to fully understand the pain-points and to respond with solutions that can make the life of the treasurer as easy as it can be. In fact, the more sophisticated, reliable and robust the technology we can provide the easier and better the treasury will perform its many tasks, freeing up time. It’s about competency and pro-activity on our side but it is also about harmonising technology to make it as simple and reliable as possible. But reliable systems and high quality solutions must in turn be accompanied by competence and commitment from us. Customers require guidance and recommendations from banks in regards to strategic matters, setting up complex cash management solutions and regulatory issues as well as a high level of operational quality and customer service in daily operations.</p>
<p>I have noted that there is an ongoing industry move towards standardisation of processes and we fully support such a move. We are, for example, a member of the SWIFT Common Global Implementation initiative (CGI) for ISO 20022 bank-to-corporate messaging. We were also the first bank in Europe to support the Transaction Workflow Innovation Standards Team (TWIST) solution for unified bank billing; it is surprising that there is not more discussion about TWIST in the market place because many banking customers say they are frustrated by complex charges.</p>
<p>Ultimately, our mission is to provide our customers with a positive singular experience, where the treasurer can look at his or her screen and have a complete overview of everything that matters. To achieve this, technology needs to be simple and of course to work on a daily basis. We need to continue listening, being flexible and being able to balance economies of scale with our ability to tailor-make solutions. We also believe that there should be even more involvement from customers in solution development and for that, strategic dialogue is essential.</p>
<h5 id="how-you-work-with-them-to-differentiate-from-the-pack">Your transaction banking promise to customers is that by leveraging technology and competence “we make you better”. What does this say about the customer experience and how you work with them to differentiate from the pack?</h5>
<p>That promise is not a slogan but something we use on a daily basis within cash management and transaction banking. We also have a goal of making our treasury counterpart an ‘internal hero’ by finding ways of making that person and their treasury department successful. It is about being competent and proactive, but it is also about building relationships so that the customer is comfortable telling us what their goals are. I would say the majority of our customers, once they realise and understand our genuine eagerness to do that, tend to reveal their goals; I think this reflects the positive mind-set of every individual within Danske Bank to be better too.</p></div>

<h5 id="what-are-the-main-challenges-that-treasurers-face-when-trying-to-gain-more-control/insight-into-their-companys-order-to-cash-o2c-cycle">What are the main challenges that treasurers face when trying to gain more control/insight into their company’s order-to-cash (O2C) cycle?</h5>
<p>Managing an efficient O2C cycle is of utmost importance to corporates today. However, there are two key challenges to gaining better insight into the O2C cycle: disorderly data and controls; and the lack of an effective reconciliation process.</p>
<p>With regards to the former, the key issue clients are facing is how to manage in-house data. This is due, for example, to errors in vendor data and material difficulties in managing credit limits, complex products or discounts.</p>
<p>Typically, a corporate may start out with efficient and effective master vendor data and vendor sales data, but over time – due to multiple edits and limited controls on the modifications, as well as a lack of regular updates – the data tends to become flawed. As a result, the corporate has problems with creating the correct orders and managing the process.</p>
<p>The compounding factor affecting O2C cycles is the inability of most corporates to effectively reconcile transactions. This is caused by the lack of an effective way to automate the posting of transactions and closing out the cycles. Many corporates still use manual processes and work flows to identify payments and can mistakenly close out open items on their books due to errors in the reconciliation process.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-the-main-cash-application-challenges-facing-corporates-in-asia-today">What are the main cash application challenges facing corporates in Asia today?</h5>
<p>A fully-automated cash application is still not a complete reality, because there are gaps in the payment ecosystem. Even in this day and age, best-in-class cash application processes only achieve approximately 70%-80% automation, leaving a considerable portion of payments still requiring manual intervention to confirm a match. This is a result of incomplete payment data, which is caused either by a lack of discipline from payers to include the necessary details or due to different channels used by payers to communicate what they are paying for. Both issues curtail the amount of information that can be transmitted in a payment, thereby limiting the level of automation possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Even in this day and age, best-in-class cash application processes only achieve approximately 70%-80% automation.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Asia, the extensive use of paper instruments and vouchers adds further complexity. The challenge is compounded by the need to factor in discounts, bank charge deductions and the use of multiple currencies and languages.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-the-main-challenges-to-improving-accounts-receivable-ar-efficiency">What are the main challenges to improving accounts receivable (AR) efficiency?</h5>
<p>The basic challenge is the lack of data on who is paying and what is being paid for. Even when the data is available, the decentralised way in which customers communicate this information, for example by phone, e-mail or fax, can create another challenge. Bringing such disparate – yet valuable – information together can be quite a difficult exercise for most corporates.</p>
<p>Another challenge is managing the variation in payment amounts. Effectively recognising a partial, discounted or disputed payment is a substantial challenge, potentially leading to open items being held on the books for a considerable period. Corporates, which have centralised shared service centres also have to deal with the challenge of operating in multiple languages.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-the-drawbacks-of-a-highly-manual-reconciliation-process">What are the drawbacks of a highly manual reconciliation process?</h5>
<p>A manual reconciliation process is highly laborious and time-consuming, leading to unnecessarily extended days sales outstanding and slower clearance of credit limits, thus resulting in a slower sales cycle for the company and thereby increased operational cost. As the risk of mistakes is high, the need for extended controls and monitoring also increases. Another drawback of manual reconciliation is that it takes significant effort to keep a team motivated to consistently perform this repetitive task. In a shared service environment, manual processes lead to increased cost, hence diluting the gains or benefits envisaged from such a centralised set up.</p>
<h5 id="how-can-banks-help-their-corporate-clients-with-this-process">How can banks help their corporate clients with this process?</h5>
<p>Deutsche Bank, for example, has attempted to assist its corporate clients in improving the level of automation and accuracy of the cash application process in a number of ways. The solutions can be grouped into two main categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Customer identification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cash application.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the first category, banks can offer solutions that clearly identify the payer (for example, Deutsche Bank’s Payer ID) or more sophisticated solutions − such as Accounts Receivable Manager − which was launched by Deutsche Bank in April 2013 and is currently being used by a number of customers, including some large business-to-consumer (B2C) customers who effectively manage payments from thousands of retail customers.</p>
<p>In the second category, Deutsche Bank has developed a sophisticated matching engine solution that is able to draw information from multiple sources into a single consistent file format, and then uses an algorithm to match outstanding invoices with the information received by the bank. In this way, we are able to automate, to a large extent, the cash application process by delivering to our clients a matched/unmatched report of their invoices. In addition, we have been able to cater to paper-based collections through the use of sophisticated lockbox solutions.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank also provides customers with an electronic platform for their payers to conveniently log-in and declare the invoices they are paying for, as well as match payments to the data coming from the payers. These components come together to form a streamlined Management Information Solution (MIS) for clients, including the ability to manage discounts and disputes as well as partial payments.</p>
<h5 id="as-corporates-expand-into-new-markets-how-can-banks-support-them">As corporates expand into new markets, how can banks support them?</h5>
<p>Venturing into the realms of a new market is a very important and strategic decision for any organisation. With a direct presence for many decades in all the key Asian markets and a rich client experience in each one, banks like Deutsche Bank have the expertise, local knowledge and know-how on both the banking and corporate side to help customers in their expansion. Providing support for corporates that plan to venture further afield starts with giving them the correct and timely guidance and insights into the new market. This includes sharing our insights and connecting them with our existing customers – as well as regulators – to help them with the process.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank is able to assist its clients with a quick and easy enablement of accounts and banking services in the new market. Through globally-consistent operating procedures, the bank is also able to translate the corporate’s global policies and procedures into the new environment. Thereafter, Deutsche Bank continues to support its clients in the new market by providing the necessary market research and regulatory updates on an ongoing basis. At the same time, the Bank takes a consultative approach to understanding clients and their situation by recommending the best solutions most suited to their needs across our wide range of banking solutions.</p>
<h5 id="what-does-partnering-with-local-banks-in-asia-really-mean-what-is-the-key-to-success">What does partnering with local banks in Asia really mean? What is the key to success?</h5>
<p>Partnering is an often misunderstood term in the context of how global and local banks co-operate with each other, and is very loosely defined in the context of Asia. A true partnership between a global and local bank should mean a mutually beneficial, sustainable and integrated solution that helps meet a client’s need with minimal incremental effort and no additional counterparty exposures.</p>
<p>There are three key aspects that make a partnership with a local bank successful:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Partners should not be direct competitors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both partners should benefit from the solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There should be a significant barrier to entry for each partner to offer the solution independently.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Deutsche Bank, for example, actively leverages partner banks in Asia to enhance its service proposition. Its business model in Asia complements the strategy of local banks in the region. This is key to providing potential partners with the comfort that it is not a direct competitor for their business.</p>
<p>As a leading clearer of global currencies including euro, US dollar and sterling, Deutsche Bank often has a client relationship already established with local banks, which helps to build a trusted relationship. In addition, the volumes generated through providing transactional services – particularly on collections – gives the local banks access to a new revenue stream, and effectively forges a relationship with its customer’s customer as well.</p>
<p>As such, Deutsche Bank strives to achieve the best of both worlds: enjoying tremendous support and co-operation from local banks, while creating solutions that allow its customers to benefit from locally-specific services or enhanced collection reach, without the need to open accounts or deal directly with a local bank (where regulations allow).</p>
<h5 id="are-asian-corporates-looking-for-greater-standardisation-in-their-relationships-with-their-banks">Are Asian corporates looking for greater standardisation in their relationships with their banks?</h5>
<p>Standardisation is an increasing trend among Asian corporates. To illustrate, Deutsche Bank has been receiving a growing number of request for proposals (RFPs) from Asian corporates, which are turning to international banks to provide streamlined solutions across multiple markets, or use bank-agnostic solutions such as SWIFT connectivity and standardised formats – like XML version 3 and MT series messages for payments and reporting – to communicate with multiple banks through the same file.</p>
<p>Asian corporates, in this case, seem to be following the lead set in Europe, where the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) migration has led corporates to review their banking relationships and streamline their operating models by adopting a single SEPA bank. Besides the obvious advantages of SEPA and cheaper transaction costs, the streamlining of banking relationships has also led to ample advantages for corporates through the standardisation of reporting and banking platforms, as well as cash application processes.</p>
<h5 id="how-will-this-help-asian-corporates-looking-to-expand-whether-in-region-or-internationally">How will this help Asian corporates looking to expand, whether in-region or internationally?</h5>
<p>The move towards standardisation in formats, communication and documentation makes it easier and faster for corporates to set up in a new market, which helps to execute their business expansion plans. Deutsche Bank promotes standardisation through the use of a single legal framework, as well as terms and conditions, for its transaction banking services across the markets in which it operates.</p>
<h5 id="what-challenges-remain">What challenges remain?</h5>
<p>While there are fewer challenges than before, some still remain. Clearing system infrastructures and bank account architecture, as well as regulatory frameworks for banking in various markets, are still not unified. If, for example, a client moves to Thailand, they need to cater to the local withholding tax certificate requirements. In China or Japan, they have to use local languages for both payments and cash application. The continued prevalence of paper-based collections through cheques and promissory notes in certain countries also remains a challenge. But over time, the complexities have been steadily diminishing and, hopefully, will continue to lessen.</p>
<h5 id="how-is-deutsche-bank-helping-to-facilitate-adoption-of-xml">How is Deutsche Bank helping to facilitate adoption of XML?</h5>
<p>Deutsche Bank has been an early and active participant in, and contributor to, the Common Global Implementation (CGI) initiative. The Bank has also been a promoter of the XML ISO 20022 format, which it considers to be the best solution currently available for a globally-consistent payment and reporting format. As a result, it has been spearheading harmonisation efforts in co-ordination with other banks on behalf of its clients, in order to achieve a commonly accepted XML file format for deployment. Deutsche Bank is fully ready with XML version 3 across the markets and has been supporting its clients in the implementation of the format to achieve better standardisation.</p>
<p>There are still some differences that exist between the banks on the definition of certain formats − mainly due to the country-specific nature of some services and value-added solutions − but Deutsche Bank is committed to continuing to engage in these discussions around the CGI.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Ireland’s economy has been through the mill in the past few years but its corporate sector has learnt how to tackle the destructive effects of the financial crisis. Treasury Today talks to the Group Treasurer of the country’s largest company about prospects for recovery and the power of knowledge.</p>
<div class="people right company">
<div class="vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Anthony Fitzpatrick</h4>
<h5 class="title">Group Treasurer</h5>
<img alt="CRH logo" class="logo org" height="42" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/crh-logo-2013-40x42.png" title="CRH" width="40"/>
</div>
</div>
<p>Ireland’s largest company, CRH Group, has navigated its way through some treacherous waters in recent times. But it is now on a more promising heading, not least because of the efforts of its own dedicated treasury team, led by Group Treasurer, Anthony Fitzgerald, and through the support of professional bodies such as the Irish Association of Corporate Treasurers (IACT).</p>
<p>CRH operates across Europe, the US, China and India and Fitzgerald has responsibility for both the formulation and implementation of CRH’s worldwide treasury strategy and policies. From this perspective he observes an Irish corporate sector that is “trying to be as upbeat about the economy as possible”. He notes that purchasing managers index (PMI) and gross domestic product (GDP) numbers over the past few weeks “are pointing towards green shoots of recovery”. But, he adds, these shoots have been “threatening to bud” for the last three years, so it remains to be seen if that thread of optimism is misplaced: if definite growth is not yet apparent, the economy is not sliding backwards either which in itself is a positive that Fitzgerald sees as heralding a fundamental change in direction.</p>
<p>Beyond the general macro-economic concerns, Fitzgerald lines up three main treasury challenges. Many banks are still deleveraging, he notes, and the availability of credit is still tight and the SME sector has felt the lack of availability most. Even if a business overcomes this hurdle, cost of credit has also jumped significantly, he notes. “Up to 2008, bank credit was perceived to be a bottomless pit of cheap money that would always be available; that’s no longer the case.”</p>
<p>The impact of Basel III and the way banks manage risk is amplified by the fact that they can’t tap the bond market as before, comments Fitzgerald. It is more expensive for a bank to fund itself and that cost is passed back into the corporate sector. Most strategic funding in Ireland (and much of Europe) has been sourced through the bank markets, with a smaller proportion of capital market or term-type funding, whereas in the US the focus is on longer-term funding. It is, notes Fitzgerald, another recent and significant change that more corporates are switching to the US model to gain stability.</p>
<p>In dealing with the issues that impact upon CRH’s treasury, Fitzgerald quotes Sir Francis Bacon who wrote in 1597, “Knowledge is power”. “Getting that knowledge by collecting relevant and timely information helps me to manage the treasury function within the business,” he says. However, given the flood of information available today, a revision of Bacon’s statement by 20<sup>th</sup> century American sociologist, Robert Staughton Lynd, is more apt: “knowledge is power only if man knows what facts not to bother with”. For Fitzgerald, this is the art of treasury in the modern world. “There is a huge body of information available so it how you distil that down to what’s relevant is the key.”</p>
<p>Fitzgerald, who will be contributing to the end-of-day round-up panel of the IACT’s (Irish Association of Corporate Treasurers) annual one-day Corporate Treasury &amp; Cash Management Conference in Dublin on 20<sup>th</sup> November, is appreciative of the association’s activities and initiatives over the years that have helped guide the profession in the most appropriate direction. “Many of these had been in place before the crisis started, but they have really come to the fore in the last few years,” he notes.</p>
<p>Possibly the most pertinent for Irish corporates has been the regular seminars run around the country by IACT that touch on areas such as regulatory and accounting changes, investment and cash management strategies, benchmarking activities and even re-financing case studies. “They have all been very relevant,” he states, adding that as well as “hitting the hot topics in Ireland” the events, which attract many of Ireland’s treasury professionals, are a great place to “have a chat about the current issues we are tackling”.</p>
<p>Green shoots or not, Fitzgerald says he is personally feeling more comfortable with the recovery in and beyond Ireland. “A lot of research I’ve read over the last couple of weeks suggests 2014 is going to be a good year and that we can draw a line under the last few years,” he says. The Eurozone crisis is still a concern and, he adds, “we need to be able to draw a line under that too because it has dragged down consumer sentiment”. However, he is looking to “a positive outcome” from the elections in Germany this month. This, he feels, will be important not just for Germany but for all Europe, “establishing the foundations for a more positive 2014 and beyond”.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Risk management has become a crucial component of the corporate treasurer’s day-to-day job. Claudia Colic, Head of Transaction Banking, UBS, delves into how treasurers are coping in the challenging environment and how their banks can assist their clients.</p>

</div>
<h5 id="describe-the-changing-approach-by-corporates-to-risk-management">Describe the changing approach by corporates to risk management.</h5>
<p>Counterparty risk remains a high priority for our corporate clients. As an example, UBS’s institutional clients today are demanding thorough reporting of their securities deposits in order to gain a better understanding of their exposures to individual custodian banks. Corporates are also displaying an enhanced awareness of operational risks, as demonstrated by treasuries who divide their operational execution between multiple providers as a way to avoid concentration risk. Due to the historically low interest rate environments, interest rates are another area of increased focus. Centralising risk management and control functions within a group of companies also remains a key topic. Indeed, the majority of projects UBS is involved in with its corporate clients start by centralising the visibility of their positions and foreign exchange (FX) management.</p>
<h5 id="what-changes-have-you-seen-in-the-way-corporates-approach-risk-mitigation">What changes have you seen in the way corporates approach risk mitigation? What do you see as the big issues?</h5>
<p>Since the credit crisis began in 2007, CFOs are strongly focused on treasury control and mitigation. This has led to a desire for more detailed information on, and understanding of, their firms’ global cash positions, expected cash flows and associated risks.</p>
<p>Pre-crisis, the aim was to maximise return on cash within certain risk limits. Corporate clients thus tended to concentrate the majority of treasury flows through a limited number of banks in exchange for better pricing. During and after the crisis, the key requirement was to minimise risks while accepting only marginal returns, if any at all.</p>
<p>As a consequence, tools and reporting processes were implemented to aggregate critical data and take remedial action in case of risk excesses. In addition, corporate treasurers began to split their positions and distribute business to several banks, so as to diversify operational and counterparty risks.</p>
<h5 id="is-this-your-perception">The all too apparent tightening of control over the banking environment, via more regulation, has seemingly been driving corporate client centralisation and efficiency programmes. Is this your perception?</h5>
<p>Corporate clients face a challenging competitive environment every day and are under permanent pressure to improve their cost base. If a company is forced to change its processes, this is always associated with additional costs.</p>
<p>As a result, corporate clients strive to leverage change to eke out margin improvements with each adjustment. On the other hand, every regulatory change compels banks to review their existing product portfolios and benchmark the expected returns under the future regulations against their capital costs.</p>
<p>This process often leads to alterations or even discontinuations in their offerings which oblige corporate clients to either adapt or switch banks altogether. With the widening availability of standardised data formats and channels, corporates – if forced to change their processes – will in return increasingly drive banks to standardise in order to exploit efficiencies on their side and realise centralisation programmes.</p>
<h5 id="how-banks-can-step-in-to-help">Can you give us some examples of efficiency programmes, such as working capital optimisation based on supply chain finance (SCF), cash pooling, shared service centres (SSCs) and payment factories? How banks can step in to help?</h5>
<p>Depending on the business model and degree of centralisation within a corporate group, we have seen a wide variety of programmes. Corporate clients are very pragmatic when it comes to finding solutions that require little effort but create a big impact. Central cash visibility can unlock unused excess cash balances that can be reduced, for example, using manual intervention. Or they can centrally manage FX exposures by centralising non-functional currency management.</p>
<p>In Europe we see many programmes that take the mandatory Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) migration as an opportunity to centralise payment and collection flows in one European location. Particularly in the business-to-business (B2B) environment, programmes to centralise the collection of accounts receivables (AR), for example in Switzerland via SEPA, are interesting ways to simplify operational cash collection.</p>
<p>Banks can help by having sales staff who understand their clients’ needs, offer feasible technical solutions and deliver what they have promised.</p>
<h5 id="how-have-technological-advances-enabled-treasuries-to-improve-operational-efficiency-around-areas-such-as-cash-flow-forecasting-cash-management-or-multi-banking">How have technological advances enabled treasuries to improve operational efficiency around areas such as cash flow forecasting, cash management or multi-banking?</h5>
<p>The emergence of enterprise-wide ERP systems and global connectivity standards has opened the door for higher levels of automation in corporate treasury centres. Multi-bank capability and efficient end-to-end processing marked an important step in aggregating and processing data at group level. This technological leap allowed companies to centralise treasury functions in a single hub and empowered the treasurer with insight into the company’s cash positions, projected cash in- and out-flows and steer the group-wide liquidity in near real time.</p>
<p>The on-going standardisation of payment and reporting formats furthermore enabled the establishment of SSCs, thus eliminating redundancies across the firm and consolidating tasks in those business units that have the highest subject matter expertise. The consolidation of volumes in specialised units did not only decrease the internal unit cost per transaction but also enabled companies to negotiate better terms with suppliers and reduce their external cost of services.</p>
<h5 id="what-does-corporate-technology-enabled-efficiency-such-as-multi-banking-or-bank-agnosticism-mean-for-banks">What does corporate technology-enabled efficiency (such as multi-banking or bank agnosticism) mean for banks?</h5>
<p>The advance in technology we’ve just discussed in combination with the prevalent standardisation trends fostered by legislative change, such as SEPA ISO 20022 XML pain/.camt messages, has not left banks unaffected. Large and mid-sized corporate clients can now interact with banks through a single channel and become independent of proprietary bank systems at a fraction of the price tag compared with just a few years ago. Banks are thus facing two major trends: firstly, large corporate clients are switching to bank-agnostic channels and diversifying banking relationships; and secondly, smaller corporate clients are consolidating relationships with a few key banks and benefiting from automated solutions, while virtually outsourcing treasury processes to the banks. To cover the needs of the first group, banks have to invest in upgrading their backbone infrastructure so that it can seamlessly accept globally adopted standards and process large transaction volumes with a high level of automation. This is the only way to remain economically competitive.</p>
<p>Addressing the demands of small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) clients requires banks to build integrated transaction banking product suites, ideally coupled with a sophisticated front-end, providing SMEs with the tools they need to focus on their core competencies, which lie outside of treasury management.</p>
<h5 id="how-has-this-impacted-banks-service-offerings">Please tell us about changing approaches to the treasury centre and the global versus regional question. How has this impacted banks’ service offerings?</h5>
<p>For corporate clients operating across the globe who have a certain regional footprint, a regional treasury centre (RTC) set-up is still the most popular option. For example, there is increased focus on Asian RTCs. In addition to this, we are seeing an increased readiness by corporate clients to bank with multiple banks, instead of just one bank, within a region.</p>
<p>For us as a bank, this means that we need to build on our local strengths in our domestic markets, enhance our capabilities in selected core markets and build up co-operative relationships with other service providers. Our goal is to deliver solutions that fit our corporate clients’ needs, even if UBS does not directly provide all the services they require.</p>
<h5 id="how-is-switzerland-uniquely-positioned-to-offer-international-treasury-centre-services">How is Switzerland uniquely positioned to offer international treasury centre services, thinking for example, about its political, financial and infrastructural readiness?</h5>
<p>Switzerland is governed by a multi-party political system that fosters an environment where decisions generally have widespread support across the political spectrum. The checks and balances in this type of system prevent inconsistent swings, such as those seen in two-party systems, where it is not uncommon for decisions implemented by one government to be reversed by its successor in power.</p>
<p>As well as having this framework of political stability, Switzerland has weathered the financial crises of the past few years with astounding success. Against its peers in the western hemisphere, the country has one of the lowest debt levels today, and its gross domestic product (GDP) has grown at above-average rates. This combination bodes well for the country to retain its attractiveness for both employers and employees in terms of future taxation levels and a low tax wedge.</p>
<p>All this, plus Switzerland’s reliable infrastructure services and well-connected geographic position in the heart of Europe, make it a prime location and domicile for global and regional headquarters and their highly skilled staff.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-the-role-of-banks-in-taking-on-overworked-and-under-resourced-sme-treasury-functions-in-switzerland">What is the role of banks in taking on overworked and under-resourced SME treasury functions in Switzerland, for example?</h5>
<p>Switzerland has such a small home market that most Swiss SMEs are heavily engaged in worldwide activities. Since SMEs have neither the personnel nor the systems resources to run complex and expensive projects, the key requirement is to simplify operational processes through easy solutions. This is why UBS, for example, provides a treasury management package in co-operation with an external provider, which meets most SME needs. SMEs can execute their renminbi (RMB) payments directly to the Chinese mainland through an account with UBS Switzerland. They can also reduce documentation by taking advantage of a UBS EUR Gateway Accounts, and access euro markets from an account with UBS in Frankfurt.</p>
<h5 id="how-are-banks-facing-up-to-their-own-issues-including-new-regulations-the-financial-environment-and-bank-and-non-bank-competition">How are banks facing up to their own issues, including new regulations, the financial environment, and bank and non-bank competition?</h5>
<p>Currently we are seeing two major trends in banking to address change and cope with the increased complexity of regulations, higher costs and pressure on margins: firstly, some are specialising in certain premium services (for example, best-in-class import/export trade advisory and execution services); and secondly, some are focused on highly standardised and scalable mass volume services (such as fully automated straight through processed (STP) execution for securities services).</p>
<p>This brings us back to the trends identified earlier regarding the different requirements of large, globally operating clients as opposed to those firms in the SME market segment. Banks need to revisit their strategies and determine which target segment or segments they intend to cover, and adapt their end-to-end business models and operational processes accordingly. In terms of infrastructure, institutions must decide whether to embrace a buy-or-build strategy, and whether to provide part of their services via a white-label offering, or maintain their own in-house service capabilities.</p>
<h5 id="how-are-banks-managing-to-overcome-current-pressures-without-negatively-impacting-upon-client-offerings">How are banks managing to overcome current pressures without negatively impacting upon client offerings?</h5>
<p>This is one of the biggest challenges. Some regulatory changes affecting banks will inevitably have a knock-on impact on our clients. One major example is increased documentation. Another is Basel III, whose enhanced liquidity provision requirements for banks will impact investment solutions for short-term liquidity. Banks’ efforts towards industrialisation mean that co-operation will be key in the years to come. At UBS, we are constantly reviewing which processes and services other partners can perform more efficiently, so that we can provide even better services through these partners to our corporate clients.</p>
<h5 id="how-will-banks-be-able-to-assist">Where do you see the next set of issues for treasurers coming from – and how will banks be able to assist?</h5>
<p>Maybe we should speak about challenges rather than issues. One aspect is that corporate treasuries need to be more integrated into their firms’ business units, achieving this by implementing solutions across the entire corporate supply chain, for example through SCF or working capital optimisation. This requires persuasiveness to get internal stakeholders on board, and it is often underestimated how many internal processes need to be changed, people trained and detail level issues to be resolved in order to do this. Technology itself is not the solution, but a tool that must be embedded and managed within the company.</p>
<p>Another challenge will come from enhanced globalisation and movement into emerging markets, where the need to handle regulatory complexity will increase, not least because what is acceptable today may not be allowed tomorrow.</p>
<p>On the market side, predictions are difficult, but with the deleveraging going on in the financial world, liquidity and funding will remain challenges in the near term. Above all, all these challenges need skilled and knowledgeable people, so the fight for talent will continue.</p></div>

<h3 id="reflections-from-singapore">Reflections from Singapore</h3>
<p>More than 440 treasurers gathered at the Singapore EuroFinance conference in late spring to take the pulse of their profession at the centre of the most economically lively region on the planet – it made for an exciting three days. One of the advantages of chairing the conference is hearing all of the presentations and receiving immense feedback from treasurers during the breaks.</p>
<p>One thing I felt was that we may be getting to an inflection point in post-global financial crisis (GFC) recovery. I am not launching into economic prognostications here. Rather I felt we may finally be moving beyond the fear, uncertainty and doubt (aka FUD) that has set the tone since the crisis.</p>
<p>On the first day, Frederic Neumann, Co-Head of Asia Economic Research and Managing Director, HSBC, Hong Kong, set set the macroeconomic scene with verve. In summary, the party will go on for another couple of years as the Federal Reserve will not take away the punch bowl until output regains the 10% it lost and unemployment drops.</p>
<p>On day three, the China focus day, Richard Dobbs, Director, McKinsey Global Institute, shared a vision of relentless urbanisation driving long-term growth focused on second and third tier cities. This macro trend will require huge amounts of steel and concrete, which in turn will require vast amounts of capital. As global investment as a % of global GDP is down 5% since ‘normal’ levels last seen in the 1970s, leaving a $20 trillion shortfall, we can expect massive amounts of capital to be invested in both the developed world’s return to normal investment levels and the developing world’s urbanisation. This basic idea was set out in McKinsey Global Institute’s December 2010 report entitled ‘Farewell to Cheap Capital?’ It seems to be contradicted by Bain’s 2012 report entitled ‘A World Awash in Money’ and even by Frederic’s earlier optimism, yet Richard and I agree that this is more a matter of time horizons than of fundamental disagreement. Incidentally, it is exciting to see, reflecting Richard’s observations on the developing world leap-frogging developed countries’ evolution, how Asian treasurers are moving fast to build 21<sup>st</sup> century treasuries, achieving in months what took Western multinational companies (MNCs) years to put in place.</p>
<p>This parallels the developing world leap-frogging many stages in telecommunications – skipping fixed line for mobile, bypassing telex and fax and going straight for the pervasive internet. In a very favourable development for all treasurers, this is starting to be reflected in payment infrastructure. In China, China National Automated Payment System 2 (CNAPS2) has brought ISO 20022 MX XML to Asia ahead of Europe’s SEPA programme. More impressively, People’s Bank of China’s (PBoC) Electronic Commercial Draft System (ECDS) has already reached 50% market share and will soon eliminate paper bank acceptance drafts (BADs) and corporate acceptance drafts (CADs), which are notorious for fraud. This means China has a solid digital platform for supply chain financing (SCF) probably a decade ahead of any Western country. In India, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) set up the National Payments Corporation of India, which has implemented a 21<sup>st</sup> century payment infrastructure within the past five years – an incredibly rapid rollout.</p>
<p>These technologies bolster Asia’s resilience in the face of global macro uncertainty. Just as technology is bringing corruption busting transparency to Nigeria and Punjab, that mind-set is echoed in the determination of Asian corporates to build robust treasury platforms to support their ambitious business plans.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is almost as if we have been going through Kübler-Ross’ five stages of grief over the loss of pre-GFC bliss.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="so-how-does-this-square-with-the-mood-on-the-floor">So how does this square with the mood on the floor?</h3>
<p>It seems to me that treasurers still recognise the uncertainties around them. The world is changing in very fundamental ways as the developing world inexorably balances global GDP. This rebalancing is ineluctable, and actually merely a reversion to the historical norm, yet its consequences are far from clear.</p>
<p>It is still not clear whether the rules of economics (and maths) have really changed or whether government intervention post-crisis has merely created a big wrinkle on the fabric of apparent reality. Either way, this uncertainty makes long-term planning and risk management even more difficult than it was before.</p>
<p>It is almost as if we have been going through Kübler-Ross’ five stages of grief over the loss of pre-GFC bliss. We first denied the crisis by thinking it would be over soon. Then who could deny a tinge of anger at whatever perpetrators you happen to latch on to? Then, bargaining along the lines of if we diversify our deposits and funding we will be okay. Treasurers are not exactly depressed, but there was a sense of inertia and a fixation on GFC itself that could be likened to a depression within the profession.</p>
<p>My sense is that we are now reaching acceptance. We are not going to get clear answers – and/or we now realise that what we thought was clear before was just illusion. We have no timeline for a return to normal. We don’t even know what normal is any more. What is new is that we accept this, even if we may not embrace it. We accept this new reality (or reminder), and we are getting on with life and all the projects we had in the pipeline that we were delaying because of post-crisis uncertainties.</p>
<p>In recent years, the GFC weighed on most of the content of the conference. Formal presentations revolved around the crisis. Economists discussed the cause and effect. Projects focused on its consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How to manage counterparty credit risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to ensure access to funding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liquidity management to reduce the need for funding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Piling up cash, and so on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From what I heard off-stage and during the breaks, the informal discussions were in the same vein. The GFC dominated and underpinned our thoughts. This year, I detect a change in focus. I think we are exiting our GFC fixation. We won’t forget the GFC – it is still with us in many ways – and one has only to think of the regulatory changes we face. Yet at the same time, the GFC is moving from centre stage.</p>
<p>This year we heard about some very ambitious projects on stage. Off-stage I felt the mood shifting to a more forward-facing focus.</p>
<p>Economists were delving into macro trends, hopefully not just because the GFC has them stumped. There were treasurers talking about how to grow sales, enhancing supply chains rather than defending them, building lean and smart treasuries to handle market opportunities, and returning excess cash to shareholders, even Apple.</p>
<p>Off-stage I felt a similar shift, even if people are still talking about liquidity management, their rationale is to support growth rather than to defend against liquidity squeezes and debt shortfalls. The GFC has changed our world but it no longer dominates it – it has moved from centre stage to important background.</p>
<p>This is a healthy and welcome development. As the saying goes, what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger. Those of us still standing have reinforced our operations against any new ‘swans’ the GFC highlighted. If there are any black swans out there, we cannot prepare for them because they are by definition unexpected. We have to accept that we do not know what is coming, and move on with supporting our businesses.</p>
<p>It is also a breath of fresh air and I am excited to see how we will progress in adopting all the new techniques and technologies that have been maturing in the background, under the shadow of the GFC.</p>
<p>We are privileged to live in interesting times.</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p>The short-term investment market is in a state of flux as central banks and other national and international bodies seek to influence its direction. With cash-rich corporate investors looking for risk-appropriate opportunities to add yield, a bank needs scale, imagination and investment expertise in equal measures if it is to differentiate itself from the pack. Treasury Today talks to Jim Fuell, Head of Global Liquidity for EMEA, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, about what it takes to be a leader in this dynamic space.</p>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Jim Fuell</h4>
<h5 class="title">Head of Global Liquidity for EMEA</h5>
<img alt="J.P. Morgan Asset Management" class="logo org" height="30" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/jpmorgan-asset-management-logo-2012-90x30.png" width="90"/>
<p>Jim Fuell, Managing Director, is the Head of Global Liquidity for Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), overseeing sales and marketing for the liquidity business. An employee since 2006, he previously worked to develop the corporate business as part of the Global Liquidity team in London and has also worked for Deutsche Bank, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and Citibank. He holds an MBA in Finance and International Business from New York University, Stern School of Business, and a BS in Business Administration, Marketing &amp; Finance from Marquette University.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-influences-are-having-the-greatest-impact-on-the-short-term-investment-market">What influences are having the greatest impact on the short-term investment market?</h5>
<p>Actions by central banks have had a substantial impact on short-term investors. For corporate investors, the challenge increasingly relates to the management of the high levels of cash that many continue to carry, in an environment where returns on that cash continue to be relatively low. This increases their overall cost of carry.</p>
<p>These factors are driving the need for a manager who is prudent and looks for appropriate opportunities to add yield, while continuing to focus on the elements that remain critical to them – capital preservation, risk diversification and the availability of liquidity. The implications of aiming for additional investment income need to be extensively assessed, and we feel well positioned to work with investors in this regard.</p>
<h5 id="so-in-meeting-the-needs-of-the-short-term-market-what-do-you-feel-are-the-key-differentiators-of-a-global-leader">So in meeting the needs of the short-term market, what do you feel are the key differentiators of a global leader?</h5>
<p>A manager in a leadership position has to have true commitment to this business combined with the ability to take a long-term view. J.P. Morgan Asset Management (JPMAM) fits this profile. A number of the issues being faced right now by clients have been seen before, and our long history in this space gives us a perspective not held by many of our peers. Providing liquidity solutions are also a core business and primary focus for us — it is not simply a conduit for other parts of our asset management business.</p>
<p>Beyond this and underpinning everything that we do is our credit, risk management and investment expertise. We have a highly-resourced group of experienced credit analysts and portfolio managers spanning the world, and a global team of client advisors, which fully engage with our clients to ensure we are providing best-in-class solutions. Working together, the teams can deliver investment alternatives across a diverse array of currencies, strategies and jurisdictions, with the flexibility to also manage bespoke portfolios to suit a client’s risk and return preferences.</p>
<h5 id="how-does-the-make-up-of-your-team-of-credit-analysts-reflect-these-differentiators">How does the make-up of your team of credit analysts reflect these differentiators?</h5>
<p>We have a total of 30 people driving our credit process, with an average of 12 years’ experience with us and 16 years of industry experience. We have an extremely low turnover and there is a good reason for this: in a research-oriented organisation such as JPMAM, credit analysts have a highly valued role. They are career analysts specialising in short-term markets and that commitment is clearly exemplified by the experience they have within JPMAM and across this industry.</p>
<h5 id="is-specialisation-an-important-part-of-portfolio-management-and-client-servicing">Is specialisation an important part of portfolio management and client servicing?</h5>
<p>Very much so! We have portfolio management teams based in London, New York, São Paulo, Shanghai and Hong Kong, each with a level of specialisation helping them to understand the markets in which we are invested, and to offer clients the attention and advice they need. We also provide an integrated approach to client servicing, which is seen most clearly in the way we support our bespoke investment or separately managed account (SMA) relationships, with each new client assigned a client service team consisting of a client advisor, a client portfolio manager and a client service manager. I believe we offer an unrivalled level of expertise, which ultimately serves to underscore our focus and commitment to truly delivering liquidity solutions.</p>
<h5 id="what-about-the-client-experience">What about the client experience?</h5>
<p>As a true global leader, we listen to clients and work with them to understand the specific challenges they face locally, and then work to develop solutions to mitigate these same challenges. In addition to specific client engagement plans, we hold annual client investment forums around the world. Events like these provide our investors with regular direct exposure to our portfolio management and credit and risk management teams. As a leader in this market, people also expect thought-leadership from us and to this end we have developed our Liquidity Insights series. As well as the global investment forums I just mentioned, the Liquidity Insights series also encompasses ad-hoc investor roundtables, focused client web-conferences and numerous topical white papers.</p>
<h5 id="why-do-your-managers-do-the-trading-as-well">Why do your managers do the trading as well?</h5>
<p>Our experienced managers are part of an investment desk strategy that sees the managers act as both portfolio managers and traders on our funds. This enables the managers to be fully apprised of all market developments as they happen, and at the same time be able to follow a streamlined decision making process with rapid execution in the market when opportunities arise. We see this alignment of the portfolio manager and trading roles as an important strength in the way we manage portfolios at J.P. Morgan. The systems used by the team are also specifically designed for money market portfolio management, decision making and trading. Our IT applications allow the portfolio managers to model quickly a trade in terms of tenor, dollar limits, percentage exposure and duration, and in turn make timely investment decisions within the fund.</p>
<h5 id="how-does-your-product-portfolio-meet-the-needs-of-investors">How does your product portfolio meet the needs of investors?</h5>
<p>The evolution of our product palette is aligned to the needs of our clients and is aimed at meeting and solving the challenges they face. On the short term side, we’ve grown from a core money market fund provider to a manager of a comprehensive series of short-term pooled investment fund solutions. Our product range includes both government and traditional credit-style money market funds alongside a product like our Managed Reserves Fund, which targets a level of return above that typically achieved by money market fund investors. Where some clients may wish to operate a customised portfolio, we have also continued to build out our ability to offer and support bespoke investment accounts. These enable a client to define specific parameters for security, returns and liquidity according to their own risk tolerance and cash flow needs.</p>
<p>Recently, the money fund industry has encountered some difficult markets and challenges never seen before – recent events in the Eurozone are a prime example of this, where actions by the central bank present a challenge for short-term managers and potentially for our underlying clients. For us, the key focus has been to create optionality for our clients, so that they have a range of solutions for the challenges they face. As an example, we were the first manager in Europe to launch a new type of share class – the Flex Dist. share class – in response to potential negative yields. In a positive environment it has similar characteristics to traditional distributing classes. If a negative yield environment prevails a mechanism can be applied to stabilise and maintain the Net Asset Value (NAV) per share at €1/$1/£1.</p>
<p>Alongside the product portfolio itself we have also maintained a focus on providing our investors with the tools and transparency to understand their investments. In this regard, we were the first manager in Europe to disclose daily market-based NAVs per share for our core liquidity funds, giving investors further valuable insight into the funds in which they are invested. We also recently introduced a new enhancement to our online client trading platform, the Global Cash Portal (GCP). In addition to the GCP’s existing features, which allow our clients to execute trades online and receive intraday trade notifications via email, we’ve also introduced a new portfolio analytics tool that allows investors to review the underlying investments within each of our funds in a more robust, dynamic way.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-approach-credit-and-risk-management-how-can-you-be-different">How do you approach credit and risk management? How can you be different?</h5>
<p>In an environment where central bank rates are low across multiple currencies, it is arguably easier to see the distinction between ourselves and our peers. Sometimes there’s an inference that all AAA rated funds are created equal, but they are not. Some of the differences reside in the manager’s approach to credit risk management and appetite for risk.</p>
<p>Our Global Liquidity investment process is built on the following three core objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Preservation of principal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintaining adequate liquidity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offering a competitive yield.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are achieved through the combination of our dedicated portfolio implementation, world-class credit research and exceptional liquidity and risk management. Our credit research team evaluates credits within their particular sector and identifies investment opportunities by utilising a variety of information sources, including reports by the major rating agencies, fundamental data (including company financial statements) and external fixed income analysis reports. The team also extensively uses Bloomberg and the Citigroup Yield Book Analytics Programme, as well as several other specialised systems, to analyse securities. Analysts independently assess issuers, using both qualitative and quantitative inputs. Qualitative research involves evaluating each issuer’s ability to avoid credit problems and event risks; assessing operating trends, cash flows, industry or product dominance and relative performance, compared with a peer group. For corporate credit, the key fundamental factors considered by the team include capital, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, industry and operating trends and alternative repayment options.</p>
<h5 id="client-reporting-is-a-key-service-requirement-what-are-you-doing-to-meet-client-needs">Client reporting is a key service requirement; what are you doing to meet client needs?</h5>
<p>At a high level, we appreciate our clients’ desire for greater transparency, and have evolved our business to meet that need. In addition to the disclosure of daily market-based NAVs, we also make our pooled-investment vehicle factsheets available more frequently and readily available via our dedicated global liquidity website, and our monthly client portfolio holding reports can now be received daily if required. Clients can also use the analytical tool within the GCP to analyse and dissect their data. All of this is aimed at giving clients an increased level of transparency around the investments that we are managing for them.</p>
<p>As a further measure, we have partnered with Clearwater Analytics to develop a web-based platform for reporting on the bespoke investment vehicles within SMAs. It’s a user-friendly but comprehensive reporting tool that’s ready for all constituencies including treasury, senior management, tax, audit, accounting and financial reporting to clients.</p>
<p>I believe these are all revolutionary steps in providing greater transparency to help investors make more informed decisions.</p>
<h5 id="what-should-a-client-expect-when-establishing-a-bespoke-investment-account-with-jpmam">What should a client expect when establishing a bespoke investment account with JPMAM?</h5>
<p>When establishing a bespoke investment account, our teams work closely with the client to set a clear mandate. The client service manager, working with our legal staff, will review and prepare an Investment Management Agreement, which outlines the responsibilities of JPMAM as a discretionary manager of the portfolio. The portfolio management team will hold detailed discussions with the client to establish the desired investment objective, benchmark, expected risk/return characteristics and other requirements of the new account. Based on these conversations, an investment strategy is developed, as well as a set of investment guidelines. These guidelines will be closely followed at all times so that the team can successfully execute the investment strategy on the client’s behalf.</p>
<h5 id="are-you-really-so-different">Are you really so different?</h5>
<p>One of the things that clients really must consider when choosing an investment manager is the level of support and ongoing relationship management and client servicing each firm has the capacity to deliver. As a leading manager, we are constantly evolving. This is why we have the capabilities and product line-up to support client needs in a market that continues to present an increasing level of challenge. It’s a commitment to the business which includes a level of resources that we don’t see replicated by most of our peers.</p>
<p>We also lead from the front. Sometimes being a leader is not easy. Being first can present more challenges. But, we choose to set ourselves apart and responsibly anticipate the needs of the market place and regulators. For the client, this means we can continue to present them with the best options in the market.</p></div>

<h3 id="general-outlook-for-2013">General outlook for 2013</h3>
<h5 id="how-has-this-affected-each-regions-trade-flow-and-its-place-in-the-global-trade-arena">There is still much financial uncertainty in the world. How has this affected each region’s trade flow and its place in the global trade arena?</h5>
<div class="person n3">
<p><span>Dennis Dubois – LatAm:</span> There has been a lot of noise about the overheating of the markets in Latin America but we need to be cautious as it’s difficult to define because of the vast disparity between Latin American countries. In the case of Brazil, was it starting to overheat? Absolutely, but the government took steps to cool it down. However, with massive infrastructure projects being built for the World Cup and for the Olympics, as well as for badly needed infrastructure development, coupled with easier credit, the risk of overheating is real and needs to be carefully managed. Mexico has been ‘rediscovered’ by a lot of US companies which are looking to make new or expanded investments there, so it too could overheat. The same could be said of Colombia, and even Peru, to a lesser extent.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span>Martin Knott – EMEA:</span> Our outlook on trade in EMEA remains positive, primarily predicated on forecasts from the WTO and projections that global trade will grow by 4.5% this year relative to global GDP growth of around 2.4%. The well-documented MENA-Asia flow growth continues to be significant.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n4">
<p><span>Maureen Sullivan – North America:</span> We haven’t seen any slowdown in intraregional activity. From a US perspective, the projections appear to show a GDP-stable growth environment of around 1.6% for 2013. It’s not overtly robust, but it indicates stability. Our view is that because there will be increased spending and investment out of this region, it will have an impact in other economic regions. The brightest spot in the US economic landscape is with the export sector, which is poised for continued growth, with more robust trade lines between North America and Asia, and North America and Latin America.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>Kuresh Sarjan – Asia:</span> Asia tends to be the global hub of trade and there’s a lot happening here, both inter- and intraregionally. It is a robust region for trade finance for the banks, as companies continue to relocate here, particularly in Singapore and Hong Kong and more generally in Asia Pacific. We operate with a direct presence in 12 countries across the region – and in others, such as Vietnam and Bangladesh, with preferred correspondent banks. In almost all we continue to see healthy activity.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="do-you-see-more-investment-by-corporates-outside-of-their-own-home-regions">Do you see more investment by corporates outside of their own home regions?</h5>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>Kuresh Sarjan – Asia:</span> Japanese companies have, for a long time, been at the forefront of global operation, but also now South Korean, Chinese and Indian companies have a much bigger footprint globally. In fact, the base of Asian inter-regional investment has accelerated, particularly out of China and India.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n4">
<p><span>Maureen Sullivan – North America:</span> Historically we’ve seen our large corporate clients well-represented with international investments, but we anticipate that there will be broader investments by our mid-sized corporate clients over the next few years, in alignment with their heightened interest in expansion as a catalyst for corporate growth.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n3">
<p><span>Dennis Dubois – LatAm:</span> We are seeing a lot of mid-sized clients entering markets they might not have considered previously. Mexico has always been of interest as a long-standing US trade partner. Given its proximity to both the US and LatAm markets, some companies are discussing either shifting or expanding manufacturing in Mexico to replace or add to what they are currently doing in Asia and evaluating how that drives supply chain/logistical efficiencies. Brazil clearly remains the principal magnet in the region, but we also have numerous large and mid-sized clients interested in selective investments in Colombia and Peru.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span>Martin Knott – EMEA:</span> It is important to understand the drivers behind this investment where it happens. For example, it may be to widen a client base or to find new or contingency suppliers. From the supply-chain perspective, we continue to see demand from Asia — China in particular — albeit activity is wide and varied. Whilst there has not been a significant change in the level of investment specifically from a trade perspective, the rationale and drivers have changed over time.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="trends-in-products-and-services">Trends in products and services</h3>
<h5 id="looking-at-global-versus-regional-capabilities-are-there-truly-any-trade-products-or-services-which-can-be-used-in-any-country">Looking at global versus regional capabilities, are there truly any trade products or services which can be used in any country?</h5>
<div class="person n0">
<p><span>Bruce Proctor – Global Trade Head:</span> When we approach product development or roll-out we try, wherever possible, to have a standardised approach that can be adapted to fit specific market requirements. We have to take a broad view of how products fit in the market and how we can use them effectively so we are not, for example, taking a US product and force-fitting it into South East Asia. As we take it to the regions we ask what we need to do to make sure we are competitive and compliant with all local requirements – but we also give our clients something of a global experience.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>Kuresh Sarjan – Asia:</span> This is a regulated market environment and regulations continue to change, depending on each country’s priorities and political imperatives and their own capital and external debt and balance of payment positions. In China, for example, there was a material change last year in the way banks were allowed to account for their short-term trade borrowings, e.g., having to treat the trade advances they received for their own existing trade exposure as ‘on balance sheet’ items. As a result, we’ve had to restructure a number of our products which are applicable in the FI space in China.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n4">
<p><span>Maureen Sullivan – North America:</span> Generally, trade products allow clients to do business in different countries by normalising the nuances of different regulations, language, customs, and so on, and this is the sweet spot of trade finance. We help our clients interact with their counterparties and reduce risk in the most cost-effective fashion.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n3">
<p><span>Dennis Dubois – LatAm:</span> Although most trade products are fairly homogenous, where variations are seen, they tend to be less about the product itself than how it can be used. As an example, in some countries withholding taxes can be an issue depending on how transactions are structured, so deal structure is likely to be more important than the product itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span>Martin Knott – EMEA:</span> It is always important to look at the client’s in-country requirements for a deal structure. These requirements may be different for the operating company of, for example, a US-parented company, compared to those of a client indigenous to that country. Acceptability from a local regulatory perspective, and an appropriate legal framework, will always be a leading consideration.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="will-we-see-a-move-to-multi-banking-where-banks-use-the-same-neutral-platform-in-the-trade-business-as-we-have-in-cash-management">Will we see a move to multi-banking, where banks use the same neutral platform, in the trade business as we have in cash management?</h5>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span>Martin Knott – EMEA:</span> From a technology perspective, we have seen more multi-bank deal structures, particularly in the supply-chain finance space. As clients have looked to expand their programmes either by value or geography, the need to bring in multiple banking partners has increased.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n4">
<p><span>Maureen Sullivan – North America:</span> There is already a nascent version of a multi-banking platform that exists for some of our large corporate clients. This was established as they migrated to host-to-host file formats. There is opportunity for further improvement though, to eliminate a lot of the separate integration effort, but the challenge is the cost-benefit of deploying and maintaining a neutral platform from which all participants can benefit. It continues to evolve, so we do see multi-banking, but not necessarily across all trade finance products.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n3">
<p><span>Dennis Dubois – LatAm:</span> What applies to North America also applies to Latin America where, among the largest companies, cost-benefit is always evaluated. Yes, they would ideally like to be on one platform rather than multiple bank platforms, but a lot of LatAm corporates are still very closely tied to one or two banks in-country. Those banks may have less sophisticated platforms, but they will always be part of the relationship, so it’s a two-track development dependent on client size and sophistication.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="how-are-new-solutions-and-technologies-received-in-the-regions">How are new solutions and technologies such as SWIFT’s Bank Payment Obligation (BPO) and International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Uniform Customs and Practice for Electronic Presentment (eUCP) received in the regions?</h5>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>Kuresh Sarjan – Asia:</span> There is a healthy interest in new solutions with a number of players across the region, particularly in China and India, adopting SWIFT tools in the trade space. When guidelines for the BPO are published by SWIFT and the ICC Banking Commission, it will drive further impetus in this area.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n3">
<p><span>Dennis Dubois – LatAm:</span> If there is a new solution that we can deliver, and local traditional banking partners cannot, when benefits are clear to the corporates, they will obviously work with the banks that can deliver. But when it comes to the traditional product suite, long-standing relationships are still an important component of decision making, though less so in top-tier clients and markets.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n0">
<p><span>Bruce Proctor – Global Trade Head:</span> The ability to be able to move more quickly onto newer technologies will be a driver of a lot of business. Generally, businesses in developing countries are faster at moving to newer technologies because they don’t have the legacy systems in place to impede progress. But, increasingly, all trade clients are technology-dependent and that is why we are investing substantial sums into our client-facing and operating platforms and processing capabilities. The fact that we have made all our products available paper-free is an indication of where this industry is going.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n4">
<p><span>Maureen Sullivan – North America:</span> Our corporate clients are always looking for ways to streamline the document-intensive nature of trade finance. They are looking for a less-costly solution, and one that will give them greater visibility. But there is a hesitancy to go down one path unless there is confidence that it will be the standard. There is a wait-and-see approach around which protocol gains the greatest number of users.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="another-wait-and-see-for-2013-is-how-far-renminbi-rmb-will-progress-as-an-alternative-currency">Another wait-and-see for 2013 is how far renminbi (RMB) will progress as an alternative currency.</h5>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>Kuresh Sarjan – Asia:</span> The RMB continues to rise in its acceptance as a trade settlement currency in the region. I think the size of what it will constitute, as a percentage of overall global trade, investment and payment flows, is still anybody’s guess. There are projections of between 10% and 30% by 2015. How soon will it become a substitute or alternative to USD, again, is anybody’s guess. But the numbers are sizeable and there has been much progress over the last few years.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n0">
<p><span>Bruce Proctor – Global Trade Head:</span> One of the big questions is whether it will become freely convertible on a broad scale. If there is an aspiration to make it a reserve or alternative currency for a substantial amount of trade financing, the ability to freely obtain it through commercial foreign exchange transactions, or to be able to provide longer-term financing in RMB outside of China, are issues that need to be addressed. We will certainly see more Asia-related activity in RMB.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="key-players">Key players</h3>
<h5 id="global-mega-banks-have-long-dominated-the-global-trade-market-but-a-number-of-large-regionals-have-become-formidable-competitors-how-should-global-banks-respond">Global mega-banks have long-dominated the global trade market, but a number of large regionals have become formidable competitors. How should global banks respond?</h5>
<div class="person n3">
<p><span>Dennis Dubois – LatAm:</span> It’s really a question of market segmentation and focus. In some markets, such as Brazil, Chile and Mexico, there are large indigenous banks who offer local products needed by all local companies. International banks offer global solutions to large local clients but most have little interest in offering purely local solutions. There is a space where both can offer complimentary solutions and partnering, either from a balance-sheet perspective or through access to local infrastructure, which can make a lot of sense.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>Kuresh Sarjan – Asia:</span> Regionals in Australia, Japan and in South East Asia, for example, are moving forward rapidly. We collaborate with them on developing solutions that benefit common clients, and we work with them as clients, but this is an important sector to watch. The overall trade finance product suite continues to evolve and our regional peers have some very good solutions. It is a large market, but at the same time it is highly competitive.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span>Martin Knott – EMEA:</span> In the region there are domestic, regional and global mega-banks. It is less common that all three will be going after the same client, so in the trade space there continues to be room for a number of players. Additionally, we see more opportunities for banks to work in partnership to meet client requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n4">
<p><span>Maureen Sullivan – North America:</span> Global banks that have the footprint can provide sophisticated financing and structuring solutions and offer an on-the-ground presence in support of multinationals. However, regional banks continue to play a role, working through the mega-banks, in the delivery of trade solutions where regional banks don’t have the on-the-ground presence. It can be a synergistic relationship and does not have to be either/or.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="risk-management-credit-and-pricing">Risk management, credit and pricing</h3>
<h5 id="the-financial-crisis-has-tightened-credit-what-trends-are-you-seeing-in-the-regions-especially-around-risk-management">The financial crisis has tightened credit. What trends are you seeing in the regions, especially around risk management?</h5>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>Kuresh Sarjan – Asia:</span> In terms of specific measures, there are a number of syndicated structures in the region for trade. We are one of the largest trade risk distribution desks in Asia Pacific. This enables us to give some reciprocity to some of our preferred trade correspondent banks, in Europe for example, that may not have as large a footprint as us in Asia, but at the same time allowing us to share the risk.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span>Martin Knott – EMEA:</span> In general terms, I think one of the key elements of risk is perception. Using technology to assess risk is one tool, but it is no substitution to living and breathing the market in which you are operating. In trade we continue to see increased activity in the risk distribution, securitisation and risk insurance space as effective tools for the trade business.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n4">
<p><span>Maureen Sullivan – North America:</span> Key for us is managing reputational risk and being sure we are in compliance with all regulatory requirements and guidelines. We deploy a variety of risk-mitigation activities to help us manage our trade finance solution set, making sure standalone products can be accretive to the overall banking relationship we have with our corporate clients.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n0">
<p><span>Bruce Proctor – Global Trade Head:</span> As well as reputational risk, risk understanding from a credit point of view is critical as it supports our client selection process. Our regional offices spend a lot of time working with our legal and compliance teams and with our operational groups, to ensure that we are really taking a broad view and doing the right deals with the right clients and in the right manner.</p>
<p>As part of a successful relationship, something that is incumbent upon us as a global player, is to be viewed by our clients as a good source of knowledge. Increasingly, they are looking for insight, advice and information on their markets. We operate on the ground in many countries and have a lot of exposure to events in the economic, political and social spheres and can help them. I think that is truly a differentiation point.</p>

<p>As Director of Specialist Banking at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, Robert Hare has responsibility for corporate deposit clients as well as corporate clients’ liabilities strategy and performance. He is a Chartered Banker and a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Bankers in Scotland. He worked with RBS for ten years and was sponsored through an MBA programme before joining Capital Bank and Bank of Scotland Group in 1988.</p>

<h5 id="why-would-a-business-need-a-formal-strategy-for-liquidity-and-what-role-does-the-banker-play-in-its-formulation">Why would a business need a formal strategy for liquidity and what role does the banker play in its formulation?</h5>
<p>We live in a world of uncertainty so it’s important that all businesses manage risk. Managing liquidity is an example of risk mitigation and companies that have taken the right steps should be able to protect themselves from surprises. They also need to be prepared for opportunities in the market. In order to fulfil both of these requirements, they have to know their overall business strategy and be able to apply it to make best use of their business assets – and cash is certainly one of them. A formal strategy for liquidity must therefore sit within the overall business strategy, directing the use of that cash. Many corporates have been concentrating on two things over the past 12 months: cutting costs and keeping cash. But the more they do that, the more imperative it is that they have a strategy for that cash. When it comes to forming liquidity strategy, global corporates and mid-cap firms are now realising that because of economic uncertainty they need to start looking at their cash balances through a different lens. And that’s where bankers come in.</p>
<h5 id="what-informs-todays-corporate-approach-to-liquidity-is-it-all-about-risk-mitigation-or-is-there-more-to-it">What informs today’s corporate approach to liquidity – is it all about risk mitigation or is there more to it?</h5>
<p>As Europe continued (and some may say continues) to implode, the concentration has been on the return of cash. But as things settle down, thoughts start to focus on the return on cash and what sort of yield it is going to get. However, in addition to protection or yield discussions, it is also about the effective use of the different types of cash a business has. Many will have a strategic cash pile, where they are looking for large projects and opportunities to acquire or to make investments. But there are other elements at work here, including a necessity to place a really keen lens on the working trade cycle of the business – especially working capital – to make sure that they are optimising that cycle, and thus their use of cash, by getting money from debtors when they expect to get it, and by making sure that they’re not paying on invoices too quickly. These decisions will all be driven by the cash strategy.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-the-dangers-of-not-forming-a-liquidity-strategy">What are the dangers of not forming a liquidity strategy?</h5>
<p>For a business, looking at its cash and liquidity strategy is like looking at its raw materials and production strategy. If either gets out of kilter with opportunities and with the operation of the business, it can cause serious difficulties. Cash has always been the lifeblood of a business, so it has always been important. The liquidity strategy must cover the immediate, the short-term and the longer-term needs of the business. The role of the treasurer or cash manager is to make sure that they have the right quality and quantity of funds available at the different points in time of the business lifecycle so they can meet any threats and take advantage of any opportunities that come along.</p>
<p>Forming a liquidity strategy is just as important for a small business as it is for a large business. Obviously it becomes more complex for the latter as they start looking at international sweeping and pooling, making decisions whether to centralise or de-centralise their cash pools, ensuring the correct reporting processes are in place in a de-centralised model or, if centralised, that the exact levels of cash are left in country for day-to-day requirements. Despite these variants, the essentials remain the same: you have to have the right level of cash at the right time. A well-formed liquidity policy helps to ensure that.</p>

<h5 id="what-can-lloyds-bank-offer-clients-to-help-them-form-and-manage-an-effective-liquidity-policy">What can Lloyds Bank offer clients to help them form and manage an effective liquidity policy?</h5>
<p>Liquidity is very much on the agenda now, but over the past nine months or so we have found, surprisingly, that many corporates don’t have a robust treasury policy to tackle it. As their banker, we’ve been talking with them to get feedback in terms of their critical needs and requirements and then helping them to shape what a liquidity policy should look like. We’re able to go to our clients – whether they’re a university, a government body or a corporate – and advise them on the areas that they should be looking at to help them formulate an effective liquidity policy. There will be elements pertinent to each business and to each sector but, as I said before, the principles remain the same. So, for example, it’s about currency and it’s about the extent to which they tie up cash. It’s about their liquidity buffer and the extent to which the business needs a pool of cash, what that pool might look like, where it needs to be, and how quickly they need to access it.</p>
<p>In terms of technology, one of the solutions Lloyds Bank has is a software product called Optimiser. This enables us to sit down with treasurers and CFOs and help them go through their past, present and future cash requirements, building as we go as complete a picture as possible of what they need from their cash and how they can achieve it.</p>
<p>Typically, we’ll go back a year or two and talk about how they have used their cash and cash sources, what trends they may have seen and what the current year looks like in relation to previous years. We can then talk about a range of aspects going forward, such as what is anticipated, whether a greater buffer may be needed for cash access, what the residual funds are and how best to invest any surplus.</p>

</figure>
<h5 id="how-open-are-businesses-to-advice-from-a-bank">How open are businesses to advice from a bank?</h5>
<p>In discussing these matters with clients we do find them immensely receptive. No one can definitively claim to have the answer to Europe’s problems – and there are many people who don’t even understand some of the questions because the landscape keeps changing. What we have found with all this uncertainty is that corporates want a trusted advisor, someone who is seeing the same sort of things that they are, but from a different perspective. The role of the banker is therefore paramount, drawing on our experience, sharing that with clients and helping them to try and look around corners at what might be coming along next. As I said, no one has all the answers, but we can help treasurers ensure they have the right level of flexibility around their business model and around their cash, so that they can optimise their response.</p>
<h5 id="how-important-is-it-to-review-policy-regularly-and-which-points-of-reference-should-be-used">How important is it to review policy regularly and which points of reference should be used?</h5>
<p>It’s not only ‘how often’, but it’s also ‘how to’. Policy review should extend from the day-to-day process of looking at and understanding what’s happening in the financial markets, to a formal consideration of whether the current liquidity policy is appropriate for the coming 12 months. In these more turbulent times I’d suggest a thorough evaluation at least quarterly to assess what they are seeing and what has changed in their own business, in the market, and in the particular banks they are dealing with. Then they can make a judgement as to whether the current liquidity policy is sufficient to meet requirements over the next three and six month periods and make changes as appropriate.</p>
<p>As for ‘how to’, undeniably there is still some concern about bank risk, so we want our clients to consider how they wish to evaluate the risk they are taking on, vis-à-vis leaving funds with banks. Some of the credit ratings agencies are still receiving criticism for their ratings dating back to the start of the 2008 crisis. They have a long road to travel to recover their reputation, but it has forced corporates, and certainly banks to encourage corporates, to evaluate the risks they are taking through different – and more dynamic – media. We say certainly look at credit default swap (CDS) ratings, and I’d add that bank share price is a major tell-tale sign too; if there’s a material movement in that, you’d really want to know why. There also needs to be an appreciation of possible impact in terms of the wider market, so do investigate what the exposures are of certain banks to different parts of the world. In essence, make sure your radar is always switched on!</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>From supporting sporting initiatives to a real focus on sustainability, in this interview, João Carlos Gomes da Silva, Head of Cash Management at Bradesco outlines the bank’s strengths, strategies and future plans.</p>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">João Carlos Gomes da Silva</h4>
<h5 class="title">Head of Cash Management</h5>
<img alt="Bradesco" class="logo org" height="25" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/bradesco-logo-2012-94x25.png" width="94"/>
<p>João Carlos joined Bradesco in 1981 and became Head of Cash Management in 2011. He is currently responsible for the development of cash management products as well as cash management sales. He has vast experience in retail banking and the middle market, and has held several roles within the bank. João Carlos has a Bachelor Degree in Accounting from FAE – São Paulo, MBA in Business Management and MBA in Business Management with an emphasis in Banking from FGV – Fundação Getúlio Vargas and an MBA in Corporate Finance from USP – Universidade de São Paulo.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-are-the-major-challenges-corporates-face-when-setting-up-treasury-operations-in-brazil">What are the major challenges corporates face when setting up treasury operations in Brazil?</h5>
<p>Brazil is a country with continental geographic dimensions. There is great ethnic, religious and cultural diversity which, in a certain way, is reflected in the way Brazilians do business. Brazil’s dimensions demand a robust and diverse financial and regulatory structure. The Brazilian taxation system, for example, comprises of three different levels – federal, state and municipal – as well as other direct and indirect taxes and contributions. I believe that understanding this structure is crucial for corporates to effectively manage their cash and provide the necessary capital to keep their treasury up and running. It is also essential to note that corporates will find a positive macroeconomic environment here based on the country’s stability.</p>
<h5 id="how-can-working-with-a-local-bank-help-to-overcome-these-challenges">How can working with a local bank help to overcome these challenges?</h5>
<p>There are many potential advantages that corporates could get by working with a local bank. Only local banks can provide a massive national footprint. Currently, Bradesco has more than 85,000 points of presence in Brazil, including branches, on-site branches and ATMs. This extensive country coverage enables us to be close to our corporate clients and to provide their financial supply chain with suitable banking solutions. In terms of tax collection, for example, local banks such as Bradesco (which has several agreements in place with government institutions) can offer a more comprehensive coverage for federal, state and municipal taxes. This enables us to collect different types of taxes in almost 100% of the country. Equally important is our deep knowledge of the Brazilian market, not only for banking, but also for the legal aspects of the market and business infrastructure.</p>
<h5 id="which-corporate-treasury-areas-do-you-think-will-be-the-main-focus-in-the-near-future">Which corporate treasury areas do you think will be the main focus in the near future?</h5>
<p>An increasing number of corporates with shared service centres (SSCs) and payment factories across the region have been looking for system and operational standardisation. Most of these corporates are looking to implement a SWIFT connection as it enables corporates to automate and standardise financial transactions, thus lowering costs, reducing operational risk and eliminating inefficiencies in their operations.</p>
<p>Cash management is another area that has been gaining importance in the everyday work of corporate treasurers. I believe that its importance will only increase in the near future given that optimising cash and improving flows of payments and collections, as well as enhancing the quality of financial information received from banks, has been a constant concern for treasurers operating both locally and regionally, or indeed globally.</p>

</figure>
<h5 id="what-competitive-edge-does-bradesco-have-in-terms-of-cash-management-solutions">What competitive edge does Bradesco have in terms of cash management solutions?</h5>
<p>Bradesco is one of the market leaders in cash management services, mainly for the local market. We have partnerships with bakeries, pharmacies and other small shops in very far flung regions of Brazil like Acre and Amazon in order to provide them with facilities – Bradesco Expresso is the name of this initiative.</p>
<p>In addition, we offer a varied portfolio of products and services that cater to different needs on a personalised basis, including payments, billing, payroll, bank reconciliation, credit cards, investments, credit facilities, and many other solutions. Most importantly, this is all done electronically and securely to further facilitate our customers’ everyday business. This is an extremely important feature for our corporate clients.</p>
<p>Following the trend of increasing globalisation, Bradesco has partnered with 33 international banks that also specialise in cash management. Moreover, we are the only Latin American bank to join the Connector, an international network of banks providing cash management services. The network currently has 15 banks covering all five continents, with more than 30,000 branches.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-bradescos-strategy-for-serving-global-customers">What is Bradesco’s strategy for serving global customers?</h5>
<p>As we are essentially a local bank, we do not have a global footprint as such. However, the primary objective of Bradesco’s strategy is to track income growth, adjusting its business model for continuity and renewal practice, while encouraging the creation of new sources of prosperity. Our presence reaches beyond Brazil’s borders and out into the world of globalisation.</p>
<p>Internally, Bradesco is a Brazilian bank par excellence, but internationally it is a kind of compass pointer for internationalising our clients’ business ventures. Our presence in New York gave rise to Bradesco America; in Luxembourg, to Bradesco Continental Europe; in London, to Bradesco United Kingdom; and in Hong Kong, to Bradesco Asia. We also have partnerships with international banks for both foreign trade and cash management.</p>
<p>The secret lies in our founding philosophy: being close to your customer. Big banks want to be strong in their home countries and have global reach, but the strategy for achieving this is to always support your customer. Historically, this has been the method for ensuring harmonious relations between training qualified personnel and technological development.</p>
<h5 id="how-important-is-sustainability-to-bradesco">A recurring topic of discussion in today’s world is sustainability. How can you ensure continuing growth with sustainability? And how important is sustainability to Bradesco?</h5>
<p>The first commitment to sustainability is made with the bank’s balance sheet. Since the numbers are increasingly healthy, sustainability has spread to all the business in which Bradesco has a presence. This is where our recognition comes from.</p>
<p>Today Bradesco acts as a benchmark for sustainability as one of the six Brazilian companies in the select group of 318 global companies comprising the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, thanks to our economic, environmental and social results.</p>
<p>We gained this recognition in 2006. Bradesco has also been rated AAA + by Management &amp; Excellence, a reputable research firm based in Madrid, for meeting global standards of sustainability, corporate governance, social responsibility, ethics and transparency.</p>
<p>Previously, the bank’s commitment to sustainability was reflected in the inclusion of Bradesco’s initiatives in the BM&amp;FBOVESPA Corporate Sustainability Index, the UN Global Compact, and the Equator Principles, which analyses and monitors the working conditions and the community and environmental impacts of projects, following Brazilian legislation and International Finance Corporation standards and criteria. These achievements are associated with quality management.</p>
<p>The practical equivalence of sustainability principles is crucial for Bradesco’s business. The overall premise is that there are three pillars of sustainability: sustainable finance, responsible management and social and environmental Investments. These are the cornerstones of Bradesco’s increasingly extensive presence and the growth of our customer base, quality loans, and products and services.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-the-basic-competencies-required-to-reach-this-level-of-sustainability">What are the basic competencies required to reach this level of sustainability?</h5>
<p>It is important to emphasise financial education initiatives, using suppliers that practice responsible social and environmental management, and the proposal to grow along with Brazilians. In general, the greater the bank’s presence, the greater the concern for ensuring best practice in business and in society. At the most basic level, an essential competency is communication with staff, which involves building a centre for sustainability across different departments.</p>
<p>This is a crucial factor for success, since it guides the bank’s initiatives for different consumers, and different products and services. In short, sustainability is synonymous with responsibility. We never fail to take into account the financial challenges that many areas of Brazil face.</p>

</blockquote>
</figure>
<h5 id="how-is-bradesco-preparing-to-meet-this-demand-and-what-are-the-main-challenges">In the next few years, Brazil will be hosting major sporting events such as the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games. A lot of investment is likely to come into the country from abroad. How is Bradesco preparing to meet this demand and what are the main challenges?</h5>
<p>I believe Brazil is already tackling the challenges of hosting these major sporting events. The main challenges are to put adequate infrastructure in place to host the events and welcome the thousands of tourists who will be coming here for the World Cup and the Olympics.</p>
<p>Bradesco’s position has always been one of believing in Brazil and in the strength of the Brazilian people, so much so that we will be one of the major sponsors of the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in 2016. These events have the potential to leave a priceless legacy for our country. It is very gratifying to know that Bradesco is part of this project. An important point to add is that we are already seeing several companies coming to Brazil to cater to the demands arising from these high profile events. Many of them are already working with us around the Cup and the Olympics. Even more importantly, they are building partnerships with Brazilian companies. We believe that everyone stands to gain, if the events are well structured.</p></div>

<h5 id="how-would-you-describe-the-liquidity-management-environment-for-corporates">How would you describe the liquidity management environment for corporates? How are you helping them in this respect?</h5>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>JF:</span> We’re in an environment right now where global interest rates are at historically low levels. In the Eurozone, the situation is particularly exacerbated as we are experiencing an unprecedented environment with negative yields being offered, so never has it been more important for corporate investors to ensure that they understand where their cash is – and how best to use it.</p>
<p>As widely publicised, corporates have been carrying higher levels of cash and the cost of liquidity is becoming increasingly expensive. Not only are yields extremely poor but in some instances banks are effectively charging corporates to take their money. In evaluating the current yield outlook, corporate treasurers may begin using more of their surplus liquidity to pay down debt as suitable investment opportunities may appear scarcer than ever.</p>
<p>From an investment management perspective, we are working closely with corporate treasurers who are asking how they can improve the return on their surplus cash. The various means to achieving higher yield clearly need to be carefully assessed (eg higher volatility, greater credit risk, maturity extension etc), but some organisations are realising that there is far greater potential to increase yield than they may have previously assumed. Assisting clients in achieving visibility over their cash – wherever it is – can be the critical first step for any company determining whether or not they are in a position to seek higher yields. This is often where we are able to collaborate with our treasury services colleagues as their technology platforms often assist our corporate clients with transparency over their underlying liquidity and the functionality to move that money to an environment where it can be used most effectively. Following this, clients can then benefit from the advice of J.P. Morgan Asset Management’s Global Liquidity business where managing short-term investments is our core competency.</p>

<div class="copy__body"><h5 id="what-have-been-the-principal-changes-across-the-liquidity-landscape-in-the-past-year">What have been the principal changes across the liquidity landscape in the past year?</h5>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span>YH:</span> I think we are seeing an exacerbation of existing trends. The deeper and more sustained period of low interest rates has been accompanied by a number of economic tremors ranging from sovereign downgrades to threats of Eurozone member exits. There’s a huge focus on risk, counterparty risk in particular, but also liquidity risk and above all accessibility of cash. Finally, we need to consider concerns around the availability of good quality investments in this economic environment. While these are not necessarily new challenges, we have reached new heights of anxiety and unprecedented pressures on yield. The last year has definitely been very challenging.</p>
<p>On the other side of the balance sheet, there are some regulatory influences, as well as general risk aversion in the market, that are leading to difficulty and uncertainty around funding. Therefore the importance of self-funding is increasing and the ability to manage internal liquidity is absolutely paramount. Clients are revisiting account and supply chain structures that they may have put in place several years back to ensure that they are efficient; that they are operating as they intended, that timing and funding is being optimised – basically ensuring that the cash flows are being used as effectively as they possibly can be. The key here is that companies are looking for sustainable approaches to address their liquidity management challenges rather than a series of knee-jerk reactions.</p>
<p>Alongside this internal focus, as a bank, we have seen a growing number of requests for guidance and more deep rooted analysis on what the market issues may be. Corporates are reviewing their investment guidelines to reassess the markets, instruments and counterparties they utilise. They want to know how quickly they can access their cash as they are now aware that even a delay of hours may be critical. They want to evaluate if the yield pick-up of longer-dated investments adequately compensates for reduced liquidity (almost certainly not). They also want to find out what challenges the regulatory changes could create for a market or a particular instrument in the future.</p>
<p>Finally, where technology is concerned, corporates are not often equipped with a large IT budget (many of them still work from a myriad of spread sheets) and consistency, which is a pre-requisite for cash management, is sorely tested in this environment. So any solution that can address both the liquidity and visibility issues in a timely and consistent manner has got to be valuable to them.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="how-can-innovation-in-liquidity-management-help-unlock-this-cash">How problematic is trapped cash for corporates? As part of this drive to optimise operational cash, how can innovation in liquidity management help unlock this cash?</h5>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>JF:</span> In an ideal world, a corporation treasurer manages to sweep all cash back to its primary domicile but, in reality, regulations or specific country restrictions will often hinder that. In addition, issues such as thin capitalisation requirements or joint venture obligations may require the corporate to maintain cash in certain regions. As a result, businesses are left with cash in a variety of jurisdictions where a local solution is needed. In these instances, corporate investors must weigh up the investment alternatives which are locally available versus what’s typically required (and accepted) by their investment policies. Sometimes, corporate investment policies are put in place with a global view but they still need to be modified accordingly as certain nuances arise – this flexibility can be crucial when dealing with trapped cash. We spend a fair amount of time working with corporate treasurers to review and offer input in relation to their global investment policies.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span>YH:</span> Regulatory concerns are obviously just one of the reasons why cash can be trapped in a jurisdiction – there are many practical reasons also. For example, a corporate may have to maintain balances on an account in a specific country because they need that to support their day-to-day operational business in that area. They might have an operating entity that isn’t particularly strong from a credit perspective and the subsidiary therefore needs to be fully funded. That cash is effectively still trapped and the corporate needs to think about how they are going to manage that on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p>That’s why the cash flows usually need to be analysed at a very granular level. It’s not just a question of figuring out what can be moved from a regulatory perspective, the analysis needs to consider what is required from an organisational and operational perspective too. You really need to be aware of which account certain balances are in, why the money is there and what the impact would be of removing that balance. It is also worth considering whether balances that are trapped could generate value in other ways. For example, could the value generated by those balances be used to pay for other banking services?</p>
<p>Visibility is only the first step in optimising cash, wherever it is. What’s also crucial is this deeper analysis and understanding of cash flows – not just on a snapshot basis – but also through regular dialogue with the local operations. That is, corporates must gain an understanding of the underlying business, not just the numbers. Considering the many opportunities there are to optimise company cash, there are numerous ways in which the surplus balance could be serving the company. Depending on the particular business situation, it could be a local investment strategy, an earnings credit arrangement, or an interest optimisation structure that serves that balance best. This is something that can be decided when the cash flows and business model are better understood.</p>

<div class="person n2">
<p><span>YH:</span> The broad geographic reach of many businesses does present challenges to the globally consistent cash management objectives of many corporates. The more dispersed the business, the more currencies, regulatory regimes, time zones and last but not least, the greater the number of banks likely to be involved in the solution. Working with a global provider who has presence in the key markets goes some way to mitigating these challenges, especially the value dating challenges presented by time zone differences. However, it is difficult to avoid solutions that include local bank providers altogether, especially in some developing markets. Ideally in these cases, cash flows through the local bank would be incorporated in the global solution in an automated manner, through a multi-bank sweep.</p>
<p>At J.P. Morgan, we have bilateral agreements in place with a large number of banks globally to enable multi-bank payments to be initiated. Multi-bank sweeping leverages these bilateral agreements by issuing MT101 drawdown messages to automatically concentrate funds from a client’s global relationship banks into a single position with an overlay bank, thus enabling more efficient use of the consolidated global position. J.P. Morgan can also concentrate funds in countries where SWIFT is not the standard method of bank- to-bank communication.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>JF:</span> I think the same-day value concept ties into the increasing demand for same-day visibility. Corporates, all too often, are not able to project cash flow balances as a result of a lack of complete visibility over their subsidiaries. From an investment perspective, a product which affords the best return is not typically the investment that also allows the greatest level of liquidity. Therefore, with greater visibility and clarity around one’s investment horizon comes the opportunity to optimise investment returns because the cash can be put to work more effectively.</p>

<div class="person n2">
<p><span>YH:</span> We are developing a range of solutions that evolve traditional product concepts and adapt them for today’s requirements. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An expansion of the US earnings credit rate concept to provide value for global balances and for services other than traditional cash management products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The creation of a deposit account that provides clients with both immediate access to liquidity and term extension.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automated investment options that are driven by the client’s parameters for diversification and risk.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these capabilities are designed to provide clients with greater flexibility in a changing market, while offering added efficiency and value for short-term cash globally.</p>
<p>Through our J.P. Morgan ACCESS Liquidity Solutions portal, which is integral to all our offerings, we are also able to offer real-time cash position reporting and inter-company administration, specifically designed to enable the corporate treasurer to gain visibility and control over all cash flows and investments. Most importantly, these capabilities are all developed globally to ensure that we can provide a consistent client experience, wherever their operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>JF:</span> From an investment management perspective, we have continued to work with clients to identify jurisdictions where they have trapped cash or where they see a lack of suitable investment options. Where markets permit, we will evaluate the potential to develop further currency offerings like the RMB fund offering we’ve had much success with in China. Beyond this, however, the current environment has resulted in an increased level of dialogue with corporate treasurers who have chosen to seek the advice of a discretionary asset manager to provide guidance in navigating today’s more challenging short-term investment markets.</p>
<p>While our core money market fund offerings continue to provide investors with liquidity, diversification and the focus on capital preservation which they require, we have also seen a certain amount of interest in fund offerings such as our Managed Reserves Fund.</p>
<p>These investors are looking for potentially higher returns than those typically achieved by AAA rated liquidity funds and are prepared to incur a higher level of risk in order to achieve this. We have also seen a marked increase in investors who are interested in working with us to manage their liquidity in a bespoke fashion and have continued to invest in our separately managed account platform to support this activity.</p>

<h5>Biography</h5>
<p> </p>
</div>
<h4>What macro trends are you seeing in the Latin American market today?</h4>
<p>The recent euro crisis was a good test for Latin America. Whereas previous turmoil had taken the region by surprise, it was a little more prepared for the latest storm. What this demonstrates is that the fiscal policies that many Latin American countries have implemented over the last decade have provided them with the tools to better withstand macroeconomic shocks.</p>
<p>A good example of this is that despite the Eurozone troubles, the slowdown of growth in Asia and the problems that the US economy is experiencing, Latin America is still forging ahead. This continued growth in the region has been buoyed by the fact that Latin America’s trade base is not heavily orientated to the euro markets. Countries in Latin America still have a great deal of opportunity stretching out in front of them. Take Brazil for example – the authorities have been doing an excellent job of managing and cultivating the nation’s import/export business with Asia. And countries such as Chile and Columbia have experienced incredible growth over the past two years.</p>
<p>Of course, there are some countries where challenges remain. Oil production and conflict with neighbouring countries has consistently placed Venezuela in the spotlight. Argentina, on the other hand, has institutional difficulties. The country is going through a period of economic growth as it is very commodity-orientated. But the environment for doing business there is highly restrictive, especially where foreign exchange controls are concerned. Nevertheless, we are still seeing companies investing in Argentina – some are external to the region, others are based in Latin America. Many of these companies are hoping to take advantage of the rebound that the country is anticipating in the near future.</p>
<h4>How has Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s presence in Latin America developed?</h4>
<p>For us, Latin America is a very important region. The bank has been investing in Latin America over the last decade, with a significant ramp-up in investment over the last 18-24 months. In 2011, we converted our investment banking license in Brazil into a commercial license. Brazil is one of the fastest growing economies in the world and with the new license in place, we have built a complete suite of products in the country.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, we have had a presence in Mexico for more than 50 years. The joining of Merrill Lynch and Bank of America has really assisted in making Mexico a linchpin of our regional strategy, together with Brazil. We have additional operations in Argentina and Chile, as well as representative offices in Peru and Colombia. The bank runs a shared service centre out of Costa Rica, which is strategically placed to help cover both US and Latin American clients.</p>
<h4>Which corporate treasury solutions are particularly in demand in Latin America?</h4>
<p>There are three major demands coming from our corporate clients today. The first is for trade solutions and supply chain finance. These help clients control their trade business in the region and accelerate some cash flows where necessary. We have a very robust pipeline on trade, both in the traditional space and in the export credit agency (ECA) financing and Exim bank space.</p>
<p>The second requirement we are seeing is for best-in-class liquidity management, within and outside of the region. With all the global challenges that corporates are encountering today, they want good quality investments and advice on how to better manage their US dollar liquidity. After all, the Latin American markets – being commodity-driven economies – are closely tied to the dollar. Companies are permitted to keep US dollar accounts abroad, making the dollar even more popular in the region. In the US, we recently launched new capabilities in terms of sweeping and zero balance account (ZBA) structures in order to help companies with their liquidity management challenges – and clients based in Latin America can absolutely leverage those.</p>
<p>Mobile technology is the third trend I would like to highlight. As opposed to being a ‘nice to have’ feature, mobile functionality is definitely something companies are looking for in Latin America. Given that there are four to five times more mobile handsets in the region than fixed telephone lines, the region is ready for mobile treasury solutions. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is investing significantly in mobile technology and we have successfully implemented solutions developed in the US market to Latin America.</p>
<h4>Is centralisation a key theme for corporates operating in the region?</h4>
<p>The largest corporations in the region are embracing best practices from the US and Europe. That might be reflected in their decision to strategically outsource certain tasks, for example their treasury structure. But increasingly, corporates are realising that the optimum model in Latin America is to run a ‘decentralised-centralised’ operation. Essentially, companies know that they need to give a little bit more control to their subsidiaries in the region, but at the same time because of regulation and compliance, companies need to maintain a degree of control centrally. Companies have been able to make this compromise through technology.</p>
<p>Another interesting trend we are seeing in Latin America is related to large American corporations moving into the region. We have seen their suppliers following their large buyers into the region to become part of their local supply chain. Rather than letting go of the dealings they have with their buyer specific to that new market, the supplier takes a leap of faith and moves into that new market to locally produce the parts their buyer wants. It’s a very strategic move and as a bank we are working to support those suppliers as well as the large buyers.</p>
<h4>Finally, what do you see as the main threat to Latin America today?</h4>
<p>While the trouble in the Eurozone is pressing at a global level, I see the slowdown of growth in Asia as the main threat to Latin America. That said, the shadow of that slowdown is dissipating slightly with the recent announcement in China of expansion into other regions to keep their incredible GDP growth going.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Brazil will continue to be an engine of growth for Latin America with Mexico a very close second. Colombia, Chile and Peru are also leading lights: they are generating the extra synergies that are needed to push Latin America even further onto the international stage. These countries have really been investing in their infrastructure and industry-related projects over the last fifteen years. They are now reaping the rewards and moving themselves ahead of the curve.</p>

<h5 class="title">Global Head of Payments and Cash Management (PCM)</h5>

<br/>
<p>Mark Buitenhek is Global Head of Payments and Cash Management (PCM) for ING. He took up the role in February 2010 following more than 20 years of varied experience in banking.</p>
<p>Payments and cash management is central to banking at ING. The unit is responsible for defining the strategy for all international cash management, payment and card products and services for all client segments worldwide and executing this strategy for financial institutions and large and mid-size corporates.</p>
<p>In this role, Mark – together with his team of about 1,500 people – sets the overall business architecture, manages the extensive product portfolio, defines and creates new products and services, steers sales and sales support and manages the risks accompanying the portfolio.</p>
<p>With ING being one of the thought leaders of the payments industry in Europe and Mark as a representative of both ING and the Dutch Payments Market, Mark participates in several European payments and cards committees.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-are-the-major-forces-shaping-the-structure-of-the-market-environment-for-treasurers-today">What are the major forces shaping the structure of the market environment for treasurers today?</h5>
<p>One of the main drivers in the corporate treasury space today is the scarcity of liquidity. This is exacerbated by the regulatory environment and capital demands on banks, such as Basel III.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, there are a number of interesting developments taking place. For example, technology has become generally cheaper and more readily available, as well as being easier to apply. Efficiency and effectiveness are also big themes linked to technology. Finally, risk management has definitely risen up the corporate agenda over the last 18 months.</p>
<h5 id="how-are-treasurers-coping-with-the-scarcity-of-liquidity">How are treasurers coping with the scarcity of liquidity?</h5>
<p>First of all, I would say that today, treasurers are doing their job even more effectively than before. This is reflected by the growing emphasis on accurate cash forecasting, in-depth reporting, and having the correct treasury structure in place. Treasurers are also managing their bank relationships more closely than ever before.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Moreover, they’re doing everything they can to unlock cash within the company. If they happen to have excess liquidity, they are spreading it across a number of banks in a variety of geographies to be absolutely sure they limit the risk.</p>
<h5 id="which-regulatory-initiative-do-you-see-as-the-biggest-threat-for-corporates-and-why">Which regulatory initiative do you see as the biggest threat for corporates and why?</h5>
<p>Basel III is going to have a huge effect on banks and on the availability of capital. For corporates, this means that there will be less credit in the market. In turn, that’s going to put an enormous pressure on corporate treasurers to be able to provide their own sources of funding. The challenge is to do that without hampering their growth too much.</p>
<p>By way of preparation, corporates should be looking to optimise their own working capital and minimise their need for bank credit. Reviewing the wallet share that they have with their banks may also assist them in securing the external funding that they still require.</p>
<h5 id="how-is-ing-helping-its-clients-through-these-tough-times">How is ING helping its clients through these tough times?</h5>
<p>It is true that the environment is challenging, but at ING we are ready to assist our clients, with a wide range of solutions in the cash management area. However, that’s simply what we do in the course of day-to-day business.</p>
<p>What we are trying to do in direct response to the tough macroeconomic landscape is work more closely with clients to help gain increased visibility over their treasury operations. This means improving their reporting capability, making it easier for them to see where their money actually is. To that end, we are also enhancing our channels to give clients a complete view of where their cash is.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, our local presence certainly helps customers to approach their treasury activities in an effective way. For instance, if you have a subsidiary in Poland, we have people on the ground who can help you there, or assist your subsidiary in moving towards a more centralised model.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote>Technology is definitely an enabler, but are banks really offering what corporates want? Not as much as perhaps they should be, I would say.</blockquote>
<p class="quote-block__source"></p>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>In addition to that, we are really focusing on simplifying our offering. Until five years ago, everybody more or less believed that having an enormous amount of product features and capability was the way to go. We’ve now moved to a direction we think everybody likes: a slimmer but more targeted line up of solutions.</p>
<p>The aim here is to make life easier for corporate treasurers. It’s a very tough job and as a corporate you don’t need 250 different options when 25 would work just as effectively. Finally, where the treasurer’s role and remit has become broader within the organisation, we are reflecting this in our own structure. We have concentrated all of our activities with regard to flow banking within one transaction banking unit, called Transaction Services. Everything is there from trade, to flow, to commercial finance, securities et cetera. So, we are combining our knowledge and personnel around the needs of the treasurer.</p>
<h5 id="what-about-technology-should-that-be-simpler-too-and-are-the-banks-really-offering-corporates-what-they-want-in-this-space">What about technology? Should that be simpler too? And are the banks really offering corporates what they want in this space?</h5>
<p>As part of my role at ING, I’m involved in numerous roundtables with corporates, where we ask those kinds of questions. ‘What do you want from us?’ It’s surprising to see how many different answers you get from different types of corporates. Some corporates are really interested in having all kinds of mobile capabilities, others say ‘we don’t really mind, so long as it works, so make it as simple as possible.’</p>
<p>Technology is definitely an enabler, but are banks really offering what corporates want? Not as much as perhaps they should be, I would say. The issue is that we come from a market where banks used to set the standards and that has changed. We have to adapt to the fact that we can no longer set all the standards in the world and then expect corporates to buy into it. As an industry, I think we are actively recognising that.</p>
<p>For instance, we used to determine which format to use and why but today the market simply determines what it is. So we will offer ten basic formats. It doesn’t matter where they come from, those are the market standards with which we cover 95% of what’s required. So that‘s a clear signal that the market has changed from a seller’s to a buyer’s market in that respect.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>It also comes back to what I said earlier: some people in this space still think that the key to success is offering a lot of opportunities and possibilities, simply because the technology can do it. What we at ING believe is that we should cater for the true needs of the client. At the end of the day, the client just wants to be able to deal with very simple – but very effective – tools.</p>
<h5 id="on-the-topic-of-standards-and-standardisation-we-now-have-a-sepa-deadline-what-do-you-see-as-the-major-challenges-that-lie-ahead">On the topic of standards and standardisation, we now have a SEPA deadline. What do you see as the major challenges that lie ahead?</h5>
<p>SEPA is meant to bring full standardisation across Europe, truly making one payments market. What we see today is that there will still be a number of small differences at country level. So while there will be standardisation far more than there is at present, there will still be differences in the market. That’s a risk because that will block the fundamental idea behind SEPA, which is that with one standard you can travel across all these countries. So that’s one major challenge.</p>
<p>The second significant hurdle is to get companies ready on time. Everyone is aware that SEPA is coming, but I would say that it is still quite far down the corporates’ list of priorities. I think that the risk is that many companies will leave it very late to begin their work on SEPA migration – perhaps as late as H2 2013. This will cause bottlenecks and an enormous amount of pressure on IT suppliers, banks and their own internal departments, et cetera. That’s one of the greatest risks and one of the real challenges we see around SEPA right now.</p>

<h5 id="on-average-how-long-does-it-take-for-a-corporate-to-migrate-to-sepa">On average, how long does it take for a corporate to migrate to SEPA?</h5>
<p>We’ve seen migration periods from six to 12 months. That’s an average figure. If you’re a very large conglomerate with a number of companies, and at the same time you want to look at centralising some of your activities, then that can easily become 18 to 24 months. I’ve also seen transformations or migrations that have cost €2-3m, so corporates need to allocate some budget for this. The biggest issue though, as I mentioned, is that if everybody draws on suppliers’ IT resources at the same time, there simply won’t be enough expertise to go around. I would say that for corporates this is a bigger and more complex operational undertaking than the migration to the euro.</p></div>

Also, what is ING’s approach to helping clients here?</h5>
<p>First of all, start immediately. Appoint a project manager. You have to organise this. If you keep simply talking about these kinds of things, it isn’t going to work properly. Corporates also need to allocate time and budget this year to SEPA.</p>
<p>Next, look at the country migration plans. Each country has a migration plan for SEPA in place (or will have that finalised and updated by the summer this year). It’s also important to remember that every country is at a different stage of SEPA uptake and corporates will need to adjust their plans accordingly.</p>

</figure>
<p>The next thing to do is to talk to your bank and your IT suppliers. Invite them to join the project from the start. You need both parties to be involved, and you need to include your internal organisation. The key is to start working on this collaboratively.</p>
<p>The right banking partner will bring with it extensive experience with other companies. For instance, if you look at Belgium, 25% of the Belgian market has already migrated. ING is one of the biggest players in Belgium and we organise roundtables with clients who have already migrated and with clients from other countries who have not yet done that. So we assist in sharing the experience we have and our clients have. Those kinds of communities really help. The same goes for the IT suppliers. I know some of the largest IT suppliers have created user groups around their ERP systems, helping other companies to move forward.</p>
<p>Also, if you have the time as a company, look at centralisation options for both your treasury and your payments factory. Making sure you integrate SEPA into your financial supply chain is also critical, and Diagram 1 illustrates how ING approaches the different aspects of the chain with its clients.</p>
<p>At ING, we are committed to supporting clients in migrating to SEPA. We believe in sharing experience with others across countries. With our dedicated and experienced staff and extensive end-to-end value-added services we support the migration. Our testing service to ensure a smooth roll-out is one example.</p>
<p>In fact, we have our own website that is dedicated to helping corporates to become ‘SEPA proof’: <a href="http://www.ingsepa.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">www.ingsepa.com</a>. There, corporates will find information on the benefits of SEPA as well as more tips towards SEPA migration and a detailed checklist. It really is a great resource.</p>
<h5 id="looking-to-the-future-what-major-developments-do-you-see-in-the-treasury-space">Looking to the future, what major developments do you see in the treasury space?</h5>
<p>One interesting area is innovation in the electronic payments market in Europe. Consumers have already significantly changed their payment habits.</p>
<p>Following on from the rise of payments with credit or debit cards, we are seeing the rise of e-commerce and that the increasing popularity of smart phones has enabled new ways of making payments. The benefits of better market integration in this area are substantial and this is definitely a development to watch out for.</p>
<p>If I were a treasurer today, I would also be looking at the possibilities of becoming less dependent on banks. So I would become de-coupled from my bank’s standards. As such, it’s easy to see why developments such as eBAM and SWIFTNet are growing in importance for clients. There’s also a lot of talk about virtual accounts. This means that you can use your virtual account, which is connected to a bank of choice, to become less dependent and you can switch more easily between banks in the future. This is all possible because of technology.</p></div>

</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>I also believe there is the possibility of further integration of the financial supply chain. So from e-invoicing to accounts payable to accounts receivable and back, we can clearly envisage a more integrated approach.</p>
<p>Another key development, in my view, will be capital market access. Some corporates can get access to the capital market and more credit out of it far more easily than others. I think we’ll see all kinds of new ways of one company giving another company credit, and that also has to do with the supply chain finance type approach, which I’m sure we’ll see much more of.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s still a lot of discussion around the euro which has not been finalised yet. In a corporate treasurer’s shoes, I would keep a very close eye on what’s going on there.</p></div>

</div>
<h4>How would you describe the state of global payments today?</h4>
<p>The payments landscape is in a dynamic state of flux. There is a great deal of innovation happening around user experience today. Significant growth in mobile payments is just one example of this, making it easier for people to initiate payments on the go. In addition, the work being done around near field communication (NFC) and contactless payments, makes this a very exciting space right now.</p>
<p>It is true that the underlying drivers of payment flows and the various payment mechanisms have not really changed: you initiate a payment because you need to pay a bill, you need to make a transaction at a point of sale, you need to pay another person, businesses need to pay each other and businesses need to transfer funds intracompany. From the value transfer point of view, the five basic mechanisms are still cash, cheque, wire, card and ACH. Nevertheless, change is happening from a regulatory point of view: take Dodd-Frank for example.</p>
<p>This is leading to shifts in the industry infrastructure.  As a result, opportunities are being created, either by changing the economics of payments or changing the rules to create different dynamics and different value propositions. Just look at Faster Payments in the UK – we are seeing similar initiatives in Singapore and the Federal Reserve is also pushing for something like this in the US.</p>
<p>From a corporate perspective, international companies are continuing to push for efficiencies in their payment flows. Many are moving away from paper to more electronic means, looking at centralisation structures, payment factories and shared service centres. While electronification may be possible in say 90% of the countries the corporate is operating in, there are still some challenging markets. Take Vietnam for example: a large proportion of the commerce within the country is still carried out with cash. In these cases, it’s very much a ‘back to basics’ approach that is required.</p>
<h4>What will be the biggest driver influencing the direction of new payment technology over the next three to five years?</h4>
<p>Consumers are one of the largest driving forces in payments. They are pushing a preference for payment choice, and for convenience and control over the process. This has led to developments such as being able to use a credit card in a taxi cab, or paying with your smartphone. Such technological developments will slowly creep into the B2B space. For example, utility companies are beginning to include QR codes on their bills and so on.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, I believe that regulation will continue to be a significant driver. Think about the Durbin amendment – part of the Dodd-Frank Act. This has dramatically changed the landscape in the United States for interchange fees. It took in the region of $50 billion out of the system, which was a real hit for those institutions that largely relied on such fees. Industry players are therefore looking for different ways to make a margin from payments and are updating their business models accordingly, often through pushing technology to work harder. On the back of this, we are seeing closed loop systems become popular, and a drive towards increasing the speed of payments.</p>
<h4>Will banks see their ability to influence the direction of future payments technologies erode with the growing strength of players such as PayPal?</h4>
<p>We, as bankers, have to be very careful about resting on our laurels. It’s all too easy to think that no one can replace the banks when it comes to payments. Personally though, I still believe that the banks will always be the ‘bricks and mortar’ of the payments industry. Although companies such as PayPal are happy to innovate in the space, they do not want the regulation, compliance and capital requirements that come with being a fully-fledged bank.</p>
<p>How the money actually moves from one account to another is the capital intensive part of the payments business. Banks need to make sure they are not relegated to simply operating in that space. This means being forward thinking and creative and offering more innovative solutions to our clients. What PayPal has effectively done is ‘filled a gap’ in the market by building an easy front end for consumers to make payments and for vendors to receive payments, whilst offering a guarantee. What the banks need to do is to look for similar needs in the market that are not being met by current offerings.</p>
<p>For instance, we are looking across the whole spectrum of payment types from large corporates and commercial banking clients, offering them integrated solutions that include foreign exchange capabilities alongside day-to-day cash requirements.</p>
<h4>How would you rate the performance of Bank of America Merrill Lynch up to now, relative to your competitors, at addressing client payment needs?</h4>
<p>There are two ways of approaching the global payments market. You can take the local route in a myriad of countries and build up, or you can be global and connect down. We have the benefit of having one global platform that can connect down to the local market, so we can create a consistent experience across all of our markets for our clients. To do this, we partner with ‘best in breed’ local institutions.</p>
<p>One of our greatest strengths to date has been the significant investment in our CashPro channels, creating a ‘best in class’ entry point into our suite of capabilities. We have also been pushing the adoption of ISO standards. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is an early adopter of SWIFT for corporates, so we’ve been very active in helping our clients to standardise and simplify their processes.</p>
<p>We’ve also been expanding our local currency capabilities to ensure we keep up-to-date with client needs. We can currently make payments in 140 currencies across 190 countries. In short, we can make payments virtually anywhere that our clients want to do business.</p>

<p>There are three themes that lie behind most of the discussions we have with corporate treasurers these days. In the volatile environment that we are currently in, it is difficult to see the direction in which your company is going, and so risk management is becoming an increasingly essential focus and a subject of constant dialogue.</p>
<p>Linked to that, corporates are now, more than ever, looking for safety and assurance, especially as the market leans towards new modes of payments and more complex flows. An extension of this, simplicity becomes very appealing. The simpler the process is, the easier it is to manage and, ultimately, the safer it will be.</p>
<p>When it comes to payment risk, our clients are very aware of the fact that there is increased tension in this space right now, to some extent linked to the overall economic crisis and also the ongoing turmoil within the Eurozone. This idea of payment risk then brings to the fore the increased importance of automation within the corporate processing and reconciliation functions.</p>
<p>For these priorities, there is a whole spate of offerings in the Global Transaction Banking (GTB) space. What matters to Société Générale is what we can do to minimise the level of risk that our clients are taking. We are investing massively in our IT systems at present to be able to provide a more streamlined payment process for our corporate clients. One of our attractive characteristics is having the capacity to offer a high-level quality service to our clients. We are continuously striving to improve that service as much as possible.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote>The corporates are aware that they need to ‘tidy up’ their organisations between now and the end of the year so, for us; it’s all about accompanying and supporting our clients during this change management process.</blockquote>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Regulations have been high on the corporate agenda in the last decade but we see the pace of adoption increasing, especially since December when the deadline for SEPA was announced. Yet, the amount of corporates that are fully prepared is negligible in comparison with ideal adoption figures. As we move towards February 2014, however, there is a growing sense of urgency as the implementation deadlines for the change in regulations come ever closer. The corporates are aware that they need to ‘tidy up’ their organisations between now and the end of the year so, for us; it’s all about accompanying and supporting our clients during this change management process.</p>
<h5 id="how-has-the-banks-approach-to-client-relationships-evolved-over-the-last-few-years">How is Société Générale helping clients to overcome the treasury hurdles they currently face? How has the bank’s approach to client relationships evolved over the last few years?</h5>
<p>What we are discussing on the GTB scene is something that has been communicated by our global relationship managers. We are not just pushing one product for the corporate – we are building a framework of products that are individual to the corporate’s needs. This is central to the client relationship and a core global ambition of the bank.</p>
<p>From a relationship point of view, we always make sure that our clients are able to liaise with several highly qualified consultants who form a solid partnership with them over time. This is vital, especially when a client moves to SWIFT, for example, as the implementation is such a long process. Corporates will need the support and the technical know-how to flag exactly where any issues are: this is where our specialists can add real value. These issues are not always product related but they may occur in the way the project is set up or in the way plans are communicated to and addressed by the various subsidiaries, etc.</p>
<p>When a corporate is introducing a specific new type of function within their organisation, whether SWIFT or otherwise, it is not just about plugging into a new programme. It is about preparing to embark on something that is new and different, adapting the entire organisation accordingly. That’s where we come in. It is not just technical advice that we are giving them; it is the whole service package. We take everything into consideration, from the legalities to the accounting. What we have found most beneficial for all involved, and are doing more and more of, is cross referencing. Whenever we complete a new project that is successful with one of our clients, we ask that corporate to be a reference point for our other clients, so they can share their experience and views.</p>
<p>Our international network also has a part to play in helping our clients to overcome recent obstacles in the environment. Every venture we embark on, we endeavour to be at both ends of the transaction. When you are a global bank such as Société Générale, with 80 subsidiaries, operating in more than 70 countries, it is our responsibility to take care of our clients from end-to-end. Taking a trade deal, for example; we have the resources to liaise with exporters in Europe or in China to provide support for the corporate from start to finish. It is somewhat of a speciality to provide an end-to-end service such as this, which is very valued by the client, particularly in this unstable environment, allowing them to manage the risks on both sides.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">

<div class="copy__body"><p>The discussion that banks are having with corporates now is improving and will only get better. At a SWIFT conference held in Paris recently, attended by a mixture of banks and corporates, the overriding sentiment was that the corporates need banks with whom they are able to have that trusted relationship.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-unique-about-societe-generales-gtb-offering">What is unique about Société Générale’s GTB offering?</h5>
<p>We are a major player in the trade finance area and we also have one of the most productive and effective networks abroad. For example, we have the largest privately owned bank network in Russia, Rosbank, with a significant presence in trade there. We are also a leading player in the regions of China and Africa; continents which are fast becoming an area of value for our clients and partner banks. We are collaborating with our banking partners and driving a lot of added-value by bulking together our assets and networking effectively and efficiently across the globe.</p></div>

<blockquote>In order to better manage their risk, a lot of clients have been tying together some factoring solutions to some trade solutions, which we have been on hand to help them with.</blockquote>

</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom">
<h2 class="h2 copy__heading"></h2>
<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>It is always so important to have cross-border banking linked to cash management and trade services. Taking this one step further, we also tend to align factoring with this. In order to better manage their risk, a lot of clients have been tying together some factoring solutions to some trade solutions, which we have been on hand to help them with.</p>
<h5 id="why-is-trade-finance-such-an-area-of-focus">Why is trade finance such an area of focus?</h5>
<p>In this regard, it is important to understand the history of the bank itself; it was founded 150 years ago, and its original concept was to accompany the top French clients at that time and enable them to grow both domestically and abroad. In saying that, it is not just trade finance that is part of the institution’s DNA; we have been part of the global top three institutions in export finance for several years.</p>
<p>Beyond GTB, the bank’s key areas of expertise are export finance, commodity finance and, as a consequence, trade finance, which has grown alongside both of those businesses. However, most of our clients don’t make the distinction between these different areas of finance when they are looking for advice, they turn to us, the experts, for this.</p>
<p>Trade is also very much linked to foreign exchange (FX); we have always been a historical player on derivatives so we already have a competitive edge in this area. We are also able to accompany our clients in several emerging markets such as China, Africa and Russia for example.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="v-spacing--bottom quote-block" style="">
<blockquote>We are the leading foreign bank in Egypt but we are also strong in regions such as Ghana. We can offer the accompaniment of flow between China and Africa, a lucrative trade which has grown in the last three years at an average 18% per annum.</blockquote>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>When in discussions with Chinese clients, it is a very attractive strength that we are able to open the doors of Africa to them, especially in French-speaking countries, but not exclusively. We are the leading foreign bank in Egypt but we are also strong in regions such as Ghana. We can offer the accompaniment of flow between China and Africa, a lucrative trade which has grown in the last three years at an average 18% per annum.</p>
<h5 id="also-where-does-the-gtb-unit-sit-within-the-societe-generale-group-now">Also, where does the GTB unit sit within the Société Générale Group now?</h5>
<p>When we were embarking on the re-organisation of the bank, we discussed a complete regeneration of how we could better service our client pool. Société Générale is fully committed to accelerating growth and excellence through multiple initiatives across all business lines, reflecting the ‘Ambition SG 2015’ plan that we are undergoing.</p>
<p>As part of this new project, instead of reporting only to the French network, GTB is now reporting to one of the three general managers of the bank. We are servicing the three main networks we have: the French network, the network outside France, and the network on the Corporate and Investment Banking (SGCIB) side. Now mutually servicing all three networks, GTB can provide services to the entire client base.</p>
<p>The restructure has only been in place since 1<sup>st</sup> January 2012 so it is a little early to tell how effective it has been in terms of processes. What we are seeing already though is that there is now a more open dialogue towards pushing projects. We have direct targets and objectives with all of the three networks, something that was much trickier to achieve in the past.</p>
<p>Despite reporting to one of the three general managers, we are still monitored as a new project. This means presenting the executive committee with status reports of how the organisation is now functioning in this new arrangement. This gives them a chance to make any amendments or tweaks to the projects if necessary. We are all very excited about the restructure and look forward to really embracing all of the opportunities it presents.</p></div>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, corporates are looking for more safety within their businesses and so, the security that the SWIFT networks can provide is proving attractive. To date, we have accompanied around 200 clients in their move to SWIFT, so we are able to take that experience and encourage more and more clients to get on board. But that’s not to say that it is an easy task to implement and we are very conscious that this is a process to which we need to allocate significant time and energy.</p>
<p>Generally, corporates move to the basic cash management aspect of SWIFT but we are now attempting to get clients to migrate to SWIFT on the trade side also. We have paved the way with Alcatel, which will be a reference for us on international guarantees as it is the first French client that we have gone live with in that respect.</p>
<h5 id="finally-what-plans-do-you-have-for-developing-the-gtb-offering-going-forward">Finally, what plans do you have for developing the GTB offering going forward?</h5>
<p>We are in phase one of our ‘2015’ project. Our drive is to upgrade our offerings across the board; improving the delivery on the cash management side, leveraging our assets on the trade side, and enhancing the authenticity of our four core businesses: cash management, trade services, cross-border banking and factoring. There is a lot to be done by combining these four businesses and through them, pushing the FX for our clients too.</p></div>

<h4 class="fn">Richard Dallas</h4>
<h5 class="title">Managing Director</h5>
<br/>
<img alt="Lloyds Bank logo" class="logo" height="20" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/lloyds-bank-logo-2012-120x20.png" width="120">
<br/>
<p>Richard Dallas holds the position of Managing Director, Transaction Banking at Lloyds Banking Group, part of the Group’s Wholesale Banking &amp; Markets division. As the recipient of significant investment for 2012, Richard’s focus is on delivering the benefits of that investment, and ensuring that Lloyds Banking Group becomes the UK’s leading house bank.</p>
<p>Prior to joining Lloyds Bank, Richard was the Director of Strategy, Product Development and Change for Barclays Insurance where he successfully launched a range of general, health, business and life insurance products. He also led a successful response to the PPI regulatory risks. Preceding Barclays, Richard was Business Development Director to Sage SME division where he delivered 10% per annum growth of the service business, major customer retention improvements and diversified the service offering.</p>
<p>Earlier at Charles Schwab Inc. Richard was Head of Products then European Marketing Director. He was responsible for asset and income growth, rapid migration to e-channels, and the launch of a range of products which included ISAs, SIPPs and Funds Supermarket.</p>
<p>Richard holds a Business Economics degree from the London School of Economics, a Diploma in Marketing and MSc in Marketing Management.</p>
</img></div>
<h5 id="why-do-you-consider-it-important-to-support-this-initiative-in-particular">Lloyds Bank is sponsoring Treasury Today’s Adam Smith Awards 2012. Why do you consider it important to support this initiative in particular?</h5>
<p>The Adam Smith Awards are about encouraging and highlighting best practice and innovation in the industry. Not only is this an excellent showcase for talented individuals and teams within the corporate treasury space, but it’s also a great opportunity to demonstrate the effective partnerships in place between businesses and banks.</p>
<p>From our experience of having one of our clients win an Adam Smith Award last year, we recognise that people take genuine pride in what they’ve done and how they have worked together to achieve the best possible solution.</p>
<p>Our sponsorship of Treasury Today’s Adam Smith Awards 2012 demonstrates how much we support what these Awards stand for. It also reflects the importance and priority that we are giving to transaction banking and the related market space.</p>
<p>We are proud to be able to champion the largely unsung work that treasurers do in what has become a vital function in the corporate world today.</p>
<h5 id="do-you-think-the-tough-economic-climate-has-actually-made-corporates-more-innovative">Do you think the tough economic climate has actually made corporates more innovative?</h5>
<p>There is no doubt that the continuing tough economic environment has caused treasurers to look again at their practices and see where they can be improved, which in many cases will lead to innovation. At Lloyds Bank, we are certainly seeing some different requests coming through from corporates, compared to say, five years ago.</p>
<p>However the most interesting change has actually been the way that corporates are now approaching solutions. They are no longer simply coming to us and saying, ‘I need x or y solution’. It’s a far more open discussion along the lines of, ‘These are our challenges, how can you help us?’ or ‘We’re trying to crack this market, what’s the best way to go about it?’</p>
<p>In other words, the ideas and innovation are coming out of collaborative conversations. Treasurers have adopted a much more open-minded approach to solutions. In addition, it’s very refreshing that there’s a definite feeling of treating the regulation that is hitting the financial services industry as a joint challenge. We are working together with our clients on ways to overcome the impact of such regulation.</p>
<h5 id="could-you-give-an-example-of-this-perhaps">Could you give an example of this perhaps?</h5>
<p>Yes, we worked very closely with Unipart on a SEPA Direct Debit solution recently. With a presence across Europe and a commitment to ‘The Unipart Way’ – a proprietary philosophy that embraces lean tools and techniques – the Unipart Group was the ideal candidate to be an early adopter of the SEPA Direct Debit scheme. Shared Services Manager Mike Morris confirms that the full service logistics provider is reaping the benefits of this ‘major opportunity for enhanced efficiency’.</p>
<p>SEPA DD has changed the landscape of European payments, and adoption is expected to become mandatory across the Eurozone for businesses of all sizes in the next few years. In the UK, Lloyds Bank Wholesale Banking &amp; Markets has been quick to facilitate the adoption of the scheme, with an offering that enables customers to be debtors and creditors for direct debits on a pan-European basis.</p>
<p>Attracted by the efficiency of collecting payments into one bank and one bank account, Unipart has embraced the scheme and was fully migrated by the end of last year. Having started roll out in Italy, mandates quickly followed in Belgium, Austria, France and Germany. SEPA DD created the opportunity for Unipart to introduce direct debit payments for the first time in some jurisdictions, where previously cost and complexity made opening accounts an inefficient option. It is a significant advantage for companies with a European presence.</p>
<p>At Wholesale Banking &amp; Markets, we are dedicated to supporting customers in all cash management transactions. Our relationship managers are experts in advising and supporting clients as they implement SEPA solutions, and seek to maximise their benefits. With SEPA DD migration deadlines set for early 2014, there’s no doubt that the time for planning and preparing is now.</p>
<h5 id="how-is-lloyds-helping-its-customers-through-these-challenging-times">How is Lloyds helping its customers through these challenging times?</h5>
<p>We are six months into a three and a half year investment plan into transaction banking. So our focus is driving out much greater product capability to the customer-base. That’s across all aspects of treasury operations from cash management to working capital and financial supply chain solutions, to card solutions.</p>
<p>One of the ways we are rolling out this improved product capability is through a new generation of technology. We are investing in building out the capabilities of our recently launched Arena e-platform to create a leading, third-generation portal. This will effectively offer clients the ability to access all their core products and services, not just from transaction banking but across our wider product set. This means that in the future, clients will be able to do all their cash management, trading, FX risk management, interest rate risk management and so on from a single portal.</p>
<p>Today, Arena – our online trading platform – offers our customers a comprehensive e-solution which combines foreign exchange and money market deposits trading with economic insight and market analysis. In the next few months, the transaction banking elements of the platform will be enhanced offering our clients balance and transaction reporting along with cash flow forecasting functionality. Clients will be able to view the balances and transactions for accounts registered in Arena including those held with other banks. Cash flow forecasting will allow clients to manage and control their cash by forecasting their investments and outgoing payments.</p>
<p>Arena’s proposition centres on the customer’s ability to combine online trading with the research, data, analysis and reporting that gives them their ‘best view of the markets’ to support their trading and hedging decisions in one single view. Additional transaction capability is seen as a key development milestone for Arena in delivering an end-to-end cash management proposition.</p>
<p>Maintaining a leading host-to-host channel, linking up information from the bank’s systems to the client’s ERP system is another priority for us on the technology front, and technology for mobile devices is an additional area of planned investment from a software point of view. These technological developments are all designed to add real value for the treasurer, giving both cost and operational efficiencies.</p>
<h5 id="what-about-specific-product-developments-that-help-treasurers-to-achieve-best-practice">What about specific product developments that help treasurers to achieve best practice?</h5>
<p>Significant areas of focus for Lloyds Bank are all of our payment and international services, information services and reconciliations. Clients are turning to us to help them make such processes more efficient and to help them improve their working capital situation on a cross-currency, cross-jurisdictional basis. Naturally this involves investment in the integration of our partner bank network as well as further investment in cross-border liquidity solutions.</p>
<p>Another area that we are investing in is the commercial cards space. In fact, 2012 will see the launch of five new card products from Lloyds Bank, which will complement our existing corporate card and p-card solutions. However, we are also working extremely closely with our clients to ensure that the true benefits of such implementations are felt across the organisation. This means assisting clients in the optimisation of card programmes to ensure they achieve best practice.</p>
<p>In order to provide the best possible service to our clients, we are also expanding the size of our team. We will be growing our network of product and sector specialists, as well as relationship managers, by over 20% this year. That is absolutely the focus for us as we strive to help our clients’ businesses to grow and evolve.</p>
<h5 id="which-areas-of-corporate-treasury-do-you-think-will-be-most-in-focus-over-the-next-12-24-months">Looking ahead, which areas of corporate treasury do you think will be most in focus over the next 12-24 months and why?</h5>
<p>The financial supply chain has definitely become a key area of focus again. Corporates are either looking for financial support for their supply chain, or to realise cost savings within it. We’re seeing growing interest in financial supply chain solutions from the private sector, the public sector and non-bank FIs.</p>
<p>The second big topic that will continue to be a concern for the foreseeable future is the focus on risk, in particular counterparty risk. In fact there is growing risk awareness around countries, currencies, banks and suppliers. It is not surprising therefore that we are seeing companies adding to their panel of banks, especially among the mid and large corporates.</p>
<h5 id="is-that-purely-a-risk-play-though">Is that purely a risk play though?</h5>
<p>No, this is a reflection on many things, not just risk. For example, it could reflect the evolving nature of the company and where they are trying to grow or shrink. It could also be a reflection of the fact that certain banks are scaling back their operations in some countries and concentrating on what they consider to be core activities.</p>
<p>Another topic that is front of mind for treasurers at the moment is planning for different scenarios – what happens should some of the financial challenges across Europe translate into a change, for example. That might mean alterations to where companies source funding, what currency they trade in, and general conditions for trading through to the interest and inflation environment in a particular country. A change doesn’t necessarily have to arise purely out of an exit from the euro, if Greece writes down its debt for example, then being in Greece has a very different potential return profile.</p>
<h5 id="which-developments-over-the-last-decade-or-so">Finally, coming back to the topic of innovation, which developments over the last decade or so, do you think have had the greatest impact on corporate treasury?</h5>
<p>There have been a number of interesting and exciting developments, but there are three that I would pinpoint as adding true value for corporate treasurers. The first of these, in particular for businesses of scale that have a centralised treasury in place, is the development of host-to-host solutions. Having the straight through benefits of such solutions is a real positive for corporate treasurers. For example, we worked with Virgin Atlantic to create our own solution, ‘Host to Host’, which allows the client to integrate their payments systems with ours, letting them save time, reduce risk and increase the efficiency of their treasury processes.</p>
<p>In my opinion, another great development that has happened in the last ten years has actually been the introduction of the SEPA Direct Debit. As I alluded to with the Unipart project, the SDD has enabled treasurers to dramatically simplify and standardise the operating components of their AP/AR functions. Although many companies are yet to embrace SEPA, when the 2014 deadline arrives, I think the SDD will really be viewed as a substantial opportunity. And let’s not forget that this is one example of something good to come out of regulation!</p>
<p>Finally, mobile and contactless payments are undoubtedly changing the way corporate treasurers think. There has been, and will continue to be, a dynamic change in the evolution of mobile and contactless payments. We see an increasing interest from the larger corporate community in these fast-developing payment acceptance technologies. Our corporate clients are now keenly interested in managing payments more effectively to give customers a different, more sophisticated experience.</p>
<p>We estimate that there are currently over 15m contactless cards in circulation and we expect that to rise to more than 20m this year. Mobile phone payment facilities will also gather pace during 2012 and it is not just the youth generation that is showing an appetite to move to cashless payment methods. So as demand increases, supply will follow. All banks need to keep pace with rate of change and innovation in the payments arena to offer customers excellence in 21<sup>st</sup> century banking.</p></div>

<h5 id="what-other-trends-did-the-survey-highlight">The results of the J.P. Morgan Asset Management Global Investment Survey were released in early December 2011. How have corporates’ investment priorities changed and why? What other trends did the survey highlight?</h5>
<p>We have been running the J.P. Morgan Asset Management Global Investment Survey since 1999. Over 13 consecutive years, the survey has grown to provide an unbroken track record and benchmark for corporate treasurers. It is also an excellent barometer for trends in the market.</p>
<p>The 2011 survey was the most comprehensive yet, with 487 corporates taking part from a broad range of industry sectors and geographies. Interestingly, we also saw a significant rise in the percentage of companies responding from the Asia region – which was up from 11% in 2010 to 20% last year. Not only does this reflect the growing importance of Asia internationally, but it also provides colour around the investment priorities in that region both today and looking to the future.</p>
<p>There are three very significant observations that emerged from this survey. The first is that the appetite for yield is returning. After several years of extremely low yields, treasurers are becoming frustrated with the returns they are able to access on their cash investments, and for the first time since the crisis began in 2007, return on investment is now the key metric for measuring investment success, with preservation of principal dropping to second place.</p>
<p>Counterparty risk also remains a significant focus, in particular where the choice of banking partners is concerned. Corporates are continuing to increase the number of primary banks that they use to achieve greater diversification. Rather than making their decisions based primarily on relationship though, financial strength has become the most important criterion.</p>
<p>Liquidity is still a key concern. Given this trend towards the return of yield though, there is a real conundrum for treasurers, as they need to trade off some of the daily liquidity while continuing to manage risks with market volatilities remaining high.</p>
<h5 id="could-china-hold-the-key-for-such-companies-to-improve-their-roi-on-cash">What can companies do to overcome this conundrum on a global basis? Could China hold the key for such companies to improve their ROI on cash?</h5>
<p>I think there are two ways corporates are going to look to improve ROI. The first way is segmenting cash and taking on duration risk. The survey supported this and showed that treasurers are increasingly willing to give up daily liquidity and invest part of their stable cash reserves over a longer investment horizon. They continue to avoid taking on more credit risk in this market.</p>
<p>The second way is to focus on those markets where there are opportunities for business growth and where investments offer higher relative value. And that is where China comes in. China can definitely hold the key for companies to increase global ROI. More importantly they can do that with a very acceptable risk profile.</p>
<p>The straight relative value of yields in China to those in the developed markets is very attractive and the risk profile of the fixed income markets in China is dominated by government issues. So a corporate is essentially taking on government risk, but with a much higher relative value. What is more, China is already a market that most multinational companies (MNCs) are involved in. Global growth is going to be dominated by the emerging markets, not by the developed markets, in the foreseeable future and China is leading the way.</p>
<p>To really highlight the potential, take the example of a MNC that uses the US dollar as its functional currency and invests cash with an average duration of six months. Its US dollar cash would yield about 60bps, while comparable yields in China can be almost ten times the amount at 4.50 – 5.50%. With expected currency appreciation, even if that company only had 20% of its cash in China, it could achieve up to 80% of its global ROI through utilising the options available in the China market.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-jp-morgan-asset-managements-jpmam-role-here">With that in mind, how can companies optimise their cash investments in China specifically and what is J.P. Morgan Asset Management’s (JPMAM) role here?</h5>
<p>Historically, companies with long cash positions in China have kept cash in very short-term investments, normally deposits that are regulated by the People’s Bank of China (PBoC). Because the yields and tenors of deposits are managed by the PBoC, the rates are not necessarily aligned to real market yields, and often are lower. Such a simple investment policy may have been understandable five years ago, but there have been a number of developments since then. The fixed income market itself has grown – and is growing – much deeper in terms of liquidity, and is now the second largest market in Asia behind Japan. More and more investment options are becoming available, too.</p>
<p>Access is still difficult, so for most companies it has been tricky to develop a direct investment strategy, but then there are more asset management products coming to market and additional investment offerings from the banks. By way of example, if you look at J.P. Morgan Asset Management’s history in China, we started to develop investment capabilities seven years ago when we launched the first AAA rated RMB-denominated onshore money market fund (MMF)*. JPMAM has a very proven investment process in China and one of the largest funds in the industry.</p>
<p>We have been using our extensive experience investing in the local market firstly to help companies understand all the investment options that are available in order to ‘de-mystify’ the China market, and then to adapt their global investment policies into China. Most companies entered China with a mind-set that they are going to keep their investment policy very simple – they’ll just keep everything in bank deposits. They are now missing significant opportunities if they don’t update their policies in order to take advantage of some of the more attractive options in China.</p>
<p>Regulation plays a key role in the investment possibilities in China. For example, regulations are now adversely impacting structured deposits and third-party entrust loans as viable investment options. However, discretionary portfolios became feasible for corporate investors due to regulatory change at the end of 2010, and this is now becoming a credible method for companies to improve returns, while adding both diversification and flexibility in China.</p>
<h5 id="how-has-the-industry-developed-since-then-and-why-should-clients-invest-in-such-funds">Can you explain how the AAA rated RMB-denominated onshore MMF came about? Also, how has the industry developed since then and why should clients invest in such funds?</h5>
<p>The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) issued guidelines for money market funds back in 2003. We took a different approach when we launched the first AAA rated fund – the CIFM RMB MMF* – in 2005. This was the first institutional, or corporate, focused liquidity fund and the first real alternative to bank deposits in the market. The guidelines were aligned to international money market fund standards so it fits easily within most companies’ global investment policies. China International Fund Management Co, Ltd., CIFM, is a joint venture between J.P. Morgan Asset Management and Shanghai International Trust, and the manager of the fund with regular communication with JPMAM Hong Kong.*</p>
<p>The market has developed rapidly. Today there are 49 MMFs in China with total assets of RMB 126 billion. However, most of those funds follow CSRC guidelines which are much broader, in terms of duration and concentration limits, than the international guidelines. Moreover, the majority of these funds also cater towards the retail market.</p>
<p>Corporate clients are always going to use a money market fund for security, liquidity and yield – that will be the key driver, no matter which jurisdiction you are operating in. There are additional benefits though in China. For example, the CIFM RMB MMF provides easy access to the fixed-income markets in China, which as I mentioned earlier are more challenging for corporates to invest in directly. Additional benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>	The fund provides daily liquidity, T+1 settlement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>	It offers the highest credit quality available in China with diversification and stable net asset value (SNAV).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>	As most of the underlying risk is government risk, the fund is similar to a government money market fund in the international space.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, although this depends on the client’s specific situation, there can also be a tax benefit to investing in the fund. The money market fund has been a good first step outside of deposits for many companies in China. Given the difference between market yields and regulated deposits, returns are often higher than term deposits even out to one year, so it is also a simple way to improve returns while maintaining liquidity.</p>
<h5 id="in-what-other-ways-is-j-p-morgan-asset-management-continuing-to-embrace-innovation-in-the-asia-region">In what other ways is J.P. Morgan Asset Management continuing to embrace innovation in the Asia region?</h5>
<p>J.P. Morgan Asset Management has been a pioneer in developing short-term investment options in Asia. Our Global Liquidity business has nearly 30 personnel across the region and we have been the only manager to launch a consistent platform form of liquidity funds in local currencies in Asia. The five different currencies that we offer funds in today are RMB, JPY, SGD, AUD and CNH. In the last two years those funds have tripled in size, on the back of corporate demand.</p>
<p>In terms of innovation in China, the move towards discretionary portfolios that I spoke about is exciting both for corporates and for us. If, as a corporate, you don’t need to hold daily liquidity and you have a reserve cash bucket there are very limited options to take advantage of in China. Discretionary portfolios not only provide better flexibility but they also provide scalability for treasurers with cash reserves. They can utilise the full range of instruments that are available in the market, including inter-bank securities, and fully customise these to each client.</p>
<p>The point around scalability is important because even with money market funds now being available, clients with large balances will normally maintain a concentration cap as to how much they can invest in an individual fund. Going in through a discretionary portfolio can provide instant scalability of cash. As cash balances grow, you can still use that single investment vehicle and achieve the same amount of diversification, whilst having access to the liquidity that you need in your business.</p>
<p>This is exciting for us. Our investment process has such a great track record, working through our Joint Venture, that we are now helping clients to become more strategic with their cash in China. It comes back to the possibility of achieving 80% of a company’s global ROI with only 20% of its cash.</p>
<h5 id="will-asia-continue-to-become-a-popular-investment-destination-for-cash">Will Asia continue to become a popular investment destination for cash? What are the main drivers behind this?</h5>
<p>Asia is already – and will absolutely continue to be – an attractive destination for liquidity and the fixed income markets across the region are primed for significant growth. We are seeing global investors shift liquidity into the region for three main reasons. The first is that credit ratings from issuers in the region are increasing, while those in the developed markets are decreasing. The sovereign ratings are also improving. Today, Asia has 11 investment grade countries. There are three AAA rated countries: Australia, Singapore and Hong Kong. We’ve also seen some significant upgrades: China has increased five notches to AA- in the last ten years and Japan has come up six notches. That’s impressive.</p>
<p>The second reason is that Asian issuers are seen as less ‘tainted’ by the global volatilities and specifically the European credit crisis. And thirdly, there is the dynamic of higher relative value that we touched upon earlier. Interest rates are higher in Asia and currencies have been appreciating across the board. For these reasons, we’re seeing a clear bias towards holding local currencies, in particular over the last year. This is not only among MNC investors but local companies from Asia as well.</p>
<p>In addition, we are seeing cash balances which are at global highs growing faster in Asia than in other geographies. This is as a result of business growth and the continued investment into Asia. Coming back to the question around innovation, as a result of this cash coming into Asia, J.P. Morgan Asset Management has expanded its credit analyst team into Asia over the past 12 months to make sure that we can cover more Asian issuers. We are also planning this year to expand the platform that we have in Asia and develop more products in key strategic markets like China, Japan and of course the CNH market.</p>

<br/>
<p>John Gibbons was named Treasury Services <abbr title="Middle East &amp; Africa">EMEA</abbr> Regional Executive in November 2011 with responsibility for the growth of the Treasury Services franchise in region. John has oversight of regional sales, product, client service, implementation, operations, technology and functional partner teams.</p>
<p>John joined J.P. Morgan from Royal Bank of Scotland/ABN AMRO where he was most recently Chief Operating Officer of Fixed Income Sales, Research and Strategy. He has over 20 years of broad experience in transaction services and commercial banking, in senior management and sales roles, at Deutsche Bank and Manufacturers Hanover in Europe and the US. John attended the University of Connecticut. He resides in London.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-does-your-new-role-entail-at-j-p-morgan-treasury-services">What does your new role entail at J.P. Morgan Treasury Services?</h5>
<p>I joined the organisation to head up the <abbr title="Middle East &amp; Africa">EMEA</abbr> division of Treasury Services, which includes cash management, liquidity and trade solutions. We have a strong team of approximately 1,400 people working across the region. That includes a large contingent in the UK and people in an additional 40 countries across the region. We also have Global Corporate Bankers in the major markets with whom we work very closely in order to address the full complement of banking solutions that J.P. Morgan offers from financing to asset management. This combination of global expertise and local knowledge allows the team to understand our client’s challenges so we can deliver the best solution across our entire Wholesale Bank.</p>
<h5 id="what-projects-will-your-team-undertake-in-2012">What projects will your team undertake in 2012?</h5>
<p>One of the key projects that the business has over the coming year is to continue to expand our presence in the <abbr title="Middle East &amp; Africa">EMEA</abbr> region. We recently built out our cash management capabilities in new branches in Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Russia and also Norway, with plans to go into 11 new countries in 2012. That represents an exciting phase of our evolutionary story.</p>
<p>This proactive agenda is focused on the traditional strengths of J.P. Morgan, with the primary mindset that our clients are at the heart of everything we do. We are listening to our clients as they remain cautiously optimistic in their growth plans. This approach supports our vision of being the first choice for global multinational companies operating throughout the world.</p>
<h5 id="how-will-consistency-of-service-be-maintained-across-these-new-geographies-in-particular-where-partnerships-may-be-in-place">How will consistency of service be maintained across these new geographies, in particular where partnerships may be in place?</h5>
<p>This is a critical question and let me first answer why. In Treasury Today’s European Corporate Treasury Benchmarking Study 2011, which J.P. Morgan supports, service quality was voted as the most important factor for clients reviewing their core relationship banks, excluding the provision of credit lines.</p>
<p>Our overall philosophy is that no matter what you do with J.P. Morgan, or where you do it, you will have the same level of execution, service and experience that our brand is renowned for. Every country operates slightly differently and our local presence combined with our global franchise ensures consistent delivery to our clients.</p>
<p>Our in-country client service offer is also complemented by Client Service Centres. These provide round-the-clock service to our <abbr title="Middle East &amp; Africa">EMEA</abbr> clients in 22 languages and ensure that when clients call to ask a question, they get an immediate and accurate response.</p>
<p>Delivering distinctive client service is a priority for us and it is also a differentiator recognised by our clients; our 2011 <abbr title="Middle East &amp; Africa">EMEA</abbr> Client Experience Survey returned a ‘Best in Class’ rating for our client service officers from 95% of respondents.</p></div>

<p>The fact that a top priority for 40% of respondents is to see their banks make further investment into efficient payment systems is significant. Efficiency really revolves around a combination of how streamlined the bank’s operations are and how prepared the client is.</p>
<p>Our role is to continually seek opportunities, working hand in hand, with our clients to make sure their treasury operation is as efficient as possible – whether that be on the payments side, rationalising account structures or reconciling receivables.</p>
<p>We continue to roll-out our single international platform for client accounts, payment services and liquidity structures. Our payments platform supports the firm’s SEPA proposition which is available from multiple J.P. Morgan branches across Europe. With the ongoing economic uncertainty, risk continues to feature at the top of our client’s agenda. According to the Study, one of the top three issues that treasurers felt they were facing in the future was appropriate risk management.</p>
<p>Although traditional risks such as foreign exchange (46%) and interest rate (13%) were key areas for respondents, with both up on last year’s numbers, other areas of risk focus emerged from the findings. These included a growing focus on enterprise risk for 13% of respondents, up from 2.9% in 2010, as well as a determination to reduce the risk of error in treasury information by eliminating spreadsheets from the treasury function.</p>
<h5 id="how-interlinked-do-you-believe-these-risk-and-efficiency-issues-to-be-and-how-can-these-challenges-be-overcome">How interlinked do you believe these risk and efficiency issues to be and how can these challenges be overcome?</h5>
<p>Risk and efficiency have never really strayed far from the treasurer’s agenda – they have just become a lot more complex. Clients’ requirements for excellent service and flawless execution play strongly to the efficiency agenda. Errors cost time and money.</p>
<p>By definition, this demands efficient technical capabilities and a strong ethos with regard to risk management. I think that is a particularly unique qualification that we have. It’s not simply that J.P. Morgan manages its own business along a strong risk axis, but that the risk management ethos is embedded in everything that we do as an institution, and equally in everything that we do for our clients.</p>
<p>The continued focus on risk and its implications for businesses, is an integral element of every decision made in treasury. While treasury has always been tasked with managing risk, the profile of the risk management function continues to be elevated with senior executives at Board level seeking a closer involvement in risk identification and mitigation. This therefore leads to heightened visibility of the activities that treasury undertakes, and increased recognition of its value to the enterprise.</p>
<h5 id="why-should-they-devote-time-to-benchmarking-activities">Given the concerns that you have highlighted there, as well as the other front line responsibilities that treasurers have today, why should they devote time to benchmarking activities?</h5>
<p>Every business unit needs the opportunity to understand how they are performing, versus a best-in-class benchmark. This helps to make sure that their aspirations are market-leading and that they know where they are headed going forward. That is simply a question of best practice.</p>
<p>In terms of the benefits of benchmarking, I believe that it’s not so much a question of how your organisation scores vis-à-vis a competitor, but whether your company or department is asking the right questions of itself. If you have a group of treasurers that have become very actively involved in supply chain finance for example, and your treasury department is not doing that, you need to understand why. It’s about making active choices.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-driving-this">Speaking of supply chain finance, 34% of respondents to the 2011 European Benchmarking Study said that it had increased in importance for their organisation. What is driving this?</h5>
<p>There was a historical divide between the supply chain function and the treasury department, but treasurers are increasingly becoming aware of the benefits of their involvement in the supply chain. As a consequence, we are seeing them move into supply chain finance (SCF) more aggressively.</p>
<p>Embracing the possibilities of the supply chain is a way to look at current best practice and future opportunities, again linking back to the question of efficiency and risk management.</p>
<p>One of the main drivers behind this growing interest in SCF is globalisation. We’re living in a connected world at a time when there is a huge amount of uncertainty across the globe.</p>
<p>As a consequence of that, the one thing that a company cannot afford is a disruption in its supply chain. SCF is one way to enhance the smooth operation of that chain.</p>
<p>This is an area that J.P. Morgan has been working on globally for several years now; Caterpillar for example, saw challenges for suppliers who might struggle to finance ramped-up production as the economy recovered post crisis and so rather than use its cash to support suppliers, chose J.P. Morgan to help balance working capital management and supplier liquidity.</p></div>

<p>Yes, working capital is always a part of this and so too is the stability of the supply chain.</p>
<p>We’ve all witnessed over the past few years what the consequences can be in not having a robust supply chain. Supplier risk has become a regular discussion with our clients whether this is caused by suppliers struggling with economic issues all the way through to natural disaster contingency.</p>
<h5 id="how-is-jp-morgan-treasury-services-adapting-its-strategy-in-light-of-the-trends-that-you-are-witnessing">How is J.P. Morgan Treasury Services adapting its strategy in light of the trends that you are witnessing?</h5>
<p>Over the years, the overriding trends driving cash management have tended to be consistent; globalisation, risk management and efficiencies. Personally, I do not really see that changing in the near future.</p>
<p>It is that view that has informed our own strategy and hence the reason why J.P. Morgan Treasury Services is focusing on geographical expansion over the year ahead on the basis of a consistent performance and risk management ethos across every market. We are on an evolutionary journey to continue to extend our capabilities and presence for clients.</p>
<p>Our global expansion is exciting and I am delighted to be at J.P. Morgan at a time of opportunity for our people and our clients.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>From the unintended consequences of Basel III to the growth of South-South trade flows, we talk to Sameer Sehgal about the current and future trade landscape. We also tackle the impact of the Eurozone crisis on trade and examine the need for increased focus on financial supply chain solutions.</p>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Sameer Sehgal</h4>
<h5 class="title">Managing Director</h5>
<img alt="Citi logo" class="logo" height="29" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/citi-logo-2010-50x29.png" width="50"/>
<p>Sameer Sehgal has been with Citi for over 13 years, and has regional responsibility for the GTS Treasury and Trade Services (TTS) Trade Business. He leads the highly experienced regional team of professionals in furthering the trade franchise in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) where Citi is recognised as a market leader. The team’s mission is to ensure that Citi’s clients across corporate, public and financial institution sectors are provided with the most innovative solutions that assist them in meeting their trade growth and risk management objectives.</p>
<p>Previously, Sameer held a variety of positions within Citi’s GTS business based in the United Kingdom, UAE and India. Besides Citi he has worked for Anz Grindlays Bank Plc and Bank of America Plc in India. He earned his MBA from the Faculty of Management Studies in New Delhi, his Bachelors in Technology from the Indian Institution of Technology in Kharagpur, and attended the Advanced Management Programme at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania in the United States.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="how-does-citi-partner-with-competing-financial-institutions-to-drive-transaction-flows-for-clients">Collaboration among banks has been a key theme recently. How does Citi partner with competing financial institutions to drive transaction flows for clients?</h5>
<p>With rapid globalisation, clients increasingly require structured solutions and collaboration from their financial institutions, thereby enabling them to unleash their own commercial growth objectives. This is particularly important as no one bank acts as a ‘one stop shop’. At Citi, our financial institutions (FI) arm is an invaluable pillar of our strategy. Consequently, it’s a segment in which we have extensively invested over the last few years.</p>
<p>To start with, we partner with roughly 3,500 banks globally in facilitating international trade. We have invested in both systems and talent over the last few years, allowing us to efficiently handle increased trading volumes and positioning us as a leading Trade Services Bank, which our clients critically rely on for cross-border solutions.</p>
<p>We have also expanded our global footprint through either new branches or partnerships, allowing us to create end-to-end solutions for clients across geographies. Whether it be trade flows between Africa and the Americas, or Asia and the Middle East, Citi’s on the ground presence and strong relationships with financial institutions in these markets, provide an excellent platform to service and support our clients.</p>
<p>It goes without saying, one needs to constantly evolve. We therefore continue to focus on designing new solutions, and proactively developing with changing times and market needs. We offer these solutions to our FI clients to help them more effectively tap into their respective markets.</p>
<p>Of late, we’re witnessing a shortage of US dollars in the market and are working closely with our FI clients in finding solutions that a) enable them to access liquidity and b) ensure international trade is not negatively impacted.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-the-most-important-trends-at-the-moment">What is Citi seeing in the market place currently and what are the most important trends at the moment?</h5>
<p>I think the most topical impact at the moment is the heightened risk perception in the market. A great deal of factors contribute to this, such as political change in the Middle East and North African countries coupled with the European credit crisis. And contrary to the corporate credit crisis we experienced in 2008, the current European credit crisis seems to be a wider sovereign issue. While one would like to be more optimistic, conditions in the wider global economy may not improve over the next six to nine months. Therefore, we are seeing corporates cautiously planning for the road ahead.</p>
<p>For example, we see exporters looking to hedge possible counterparty and sovereign exposures. They want confirmation that their proceeds will be realised. One therefore sees a trend back to basics as letters of credit (LCs) replace open account trades, and a far greater need to confirm LCs. Not surprisingly this trend is being extended to obligations owed from the developed world as well.</p>
<p>Given Citi’s footprint and experience in this business, we are reaching out to our customers and providing them the comfort and solutions they require. We’re also working closely with our FI clients in structuring solutions for their own customer base.</p>
<h5 id="how-does-citis-relationship-with-financial-institutions-globally-help-clients-overcome-adverse-credit-environments-and-ease-administrative-burden">How does Citi’s relationship with financial institutions globally help clients overcome adverse credit environments and ease administrative burden?</h5>
<p>There are three main roles that we take in supporting our clients through our FI partnerships. The first is to connect the exporter and the importer together: as I mentioned, we support our financial institution partners through our global footprint to allow clients greater access to trade services across geographies.</p>
<p>Another area where we are very ‘hands-on’ is training. At Citi, we take our role and relationship with our clients very seriously. We continue to support our FI relationships through dedicated training teams which on a regular basis a) share knowledge and experience, both theoretical and practical, with our clients and b) keep our customers informed of changes in laws and regulations that impact day-to-day trade.</p>
<p>Thirdly, given the challenging trade environment we are working with both clients and government agencies to structure financing solutions, facilitating continued international trade.</p>
<h5 id="how-is-citi-working-with-regulators-and-market-bodies-as-the-implications-of-basel-iii-proposals-continue-to-be-debated-refined-and-understood">Another key topic this year has been regulation. How is Citi working with regulators and market bodies as the implications of Basel III proposals continue to be debated, refined and understood?</h5>
<p>Given that we offer trade services in more than 80 countries, Citi works very closely with the regulators across the globe. We view this as an important part of our role as a responsible financial institution. We regularly engage with regulators on a number of topics helping markets to evolve – including the implementation of policies impacting international trade. We actively participate in working committees and work groups where such issues can be discussed and best practices adopted. For example, advise on technology and the way in which the effective use of automation can catalyse trade processing in various countries. State of the art, internet banking solutions can also help expedite communication between various constituencies within a trade transaction.</p>
<p>We’re also working very closely with the ICC, WTO and regulators in several markets with regard to Basel III. As currently proposed, Basel III would cause the pricing of trade products to increase, and could mean banks refocusing on their core clients, thereby reducing trade finance for the SME sector. It’s been our priority over the past three to four years to work closely with the financial community to represent these concerns with the Basel committee. I am happy to note that the engagement has been very positive. Basel has recently taken steps to address concerns with regard to trade, and have just modified the one year tenor floor to actual maturity of the trade transaction. This is a very positive signal for the trade business, and we look forward to working with Basel to make it even more trade friendly.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-see-the-challenges-in-the-regulatory-landscape-impacting-both-your-fi-and-your-corporate-client-relationships">How do you see the challenges in the regulatory landscape impacting both your FI and your corporate client relationships?</h5>
<p>Naturally, regulation plays a pivotal role for the banking industry and trade is no different. To start with, the governing rules for trade published by the ICC have a far reaching impact on the products and solutions we structure. In country, regulatory and foreign exchange guidelines determine the arena in which we operate. Laws supporting technology in various countries decide the extent of automation we can offer to our clients in those markets. And then regulations such as Basel are fundamental to the way we operate, and services we can offer our clients. It is for this reason that some markets are more skewed toward funding solutions versus others which operate under unfunded instruments. Similarly some markets see more negotiable instruments, while they are not prevalent in other markets due to stamp duties. And in some countries it’s easier to offer our technology solutions such as CitiDirect, while in other countries we are required to operate manually.</p>
<h5 id="how-has-the-eurozone-crisis-impacted-trade-in-the-emea-region">How has the Eurozone crisis impacted trade in the EMEA region?</h5>
<p>The European debt crisis has had a deep impact on the banking sector, and I dare say this impact will be felt for years to come. At present, European banks that specifically have exposures to the beleaguered economies require capitalisation. They are therefore either conserving liquidity until greater clarity emerges on how much they need to reserve, or are already starting to face liquidity concerns. Hence, we’ve seen a gradual reduction in trade lending across the EMEA markets as the sector waits for the situation to stabilise. We are working closely with our FI and corporate clients to help them meet their trade finance needs.</p>
<h5 id="how-is-citi-handling-the-situation">You alluded to US dollar liquidity earlier. Trade and commodities are often denominated in US dollars and European banks are struggling as it is very expensive for them to swap euros to dollars. How is Citi handling the situation?</h5>
<p>We are committed to servicing the trade asset needs of our clients. Over the last few months, we’ve helped structure numerous solutions, providing our clients with access to liquidity allowing them to fund their growth strategies. That extends to our commodities clients as well, to whom we continue to provide coverage for their flows across the globe.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-the-most-significant-trends-you-are-seeing-in-global-trade-flows-today">What are the most significant trends you are seeing in global trade flows today?</h5>
<p>Globalisation continues to be the single most important overarching trend. Our clients’ supply chains invariably stretch across the globe as do the markets where they do business. This has flattened the landscape and has indeed resulted in a survival of the fittest scenario.</p>
<p>Within this macro trend, there are currently micro-trends around economic protectionism. Countries are implementing regulations to protect domestic industries, which run contrary to a free economy and the principles of globalisation. However, this seems temporary, and we hope that over the next 12-15 months barriers to entry and exit for international trade will diminish.</p>
<p>Another interesting trend is the gradual shift of the centre of gravity for international trade – from the ‘developed world’ to the ‘emerging markets’. This phenomenon is better known as South-South Trade, and has been accentuated over the last 12 months as Asian and Latin American countries have continued to relatively prosper.</p>
<p>Global warming is a fourth trend impacting global trade flows. Global warming is changing seasonal patterns and hence requires companies to reconfigure their production schedules and product mix to suit the altered climatic trends. This is having an impact on logistics and shipping rates as well.</p>
<p>The final trend in 2011 that I would like to highlight is the need for a healthy co-existence of customisation and standardisation. As previously mentioned, clients are moving away from open accounts back to LCs. With the global financial crisis of 2008, global trade volumes were very high while pricing was low. However, as the crisis continued, volumes fell while pricing increased.</p>
<p>In 2010, there was a slight resurgence of volumes and pricing began to fall. However, in 2011, we have once again seen a ‘back to basics’ focus. Volumes are falling and pricing is beginning to rise, which is in line with the general heightened risk perception. As such, we are therefore seeing a flight back to simple letters of credit and confirmation. That said, there is still an ever increasing demand for customisation and innovative solutions.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-see-the-trade-environment-developing-in-the-next-six-to-nine-months">Looking rather more near term, how do you see the trade environment developing in the next six to nine months and how is Citi reacting to this?</h5>
<p>To emphasise an earlier point, I think we will see the banks prioritising the markets they serve, clients they support and products they provide. This offers enhanced opportunities for banks to work more closely with each other to provide solutions to their respective customers. One can therefore sense a spirit of ‘co-opetition’ amongst banks, where ‘co-operation’ and ‘competition’ co-exist in a healthy manner.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, we continue to see innovation in the trade space. The shelf-life for new products seems to have reduced. As we develop new technology, products and solutions, they are rapidly copied and resold across a variety of markets within just six to nine months.</p>
<h5 id="what-would-your-parting-advice-to-customers-be">Given the trends that you’ve highlighted here, what would your parting advice to customers be?</h5>
<p>I would urge corporates to engage in dialogue with their banking partners to ensure supply chain stability and sustainability in 2012. I would also suggest reviewing client risk exposure that our customers are currently taking on, such as counterparty or sovereign. Finally, having a backstop liquidity source at all times is prudent at this juncture.</p>
<p>We at Citi have a wide array of products to help our clients achieve their commercial objectives, and a wide footprint to support their end-to-end requirements. Additionally, our broad client coverage provides us an excellent base to service trade flows globally and knit customers together. We offer a broad array of trade products for both financial institutions and corporates, allowing clients to achieve their funding and risk mitigation objectives.</p>
<p>Citi has almost 200 years of experience in facilitating global trade – from the first time we funded trade ships between Liverpool and New York in 1812, to today’s ever changing environment. We have remained committed to helping our clients achieve their global growth ambitions through contingent or unfunded, advisory or actual flows.</p></div>

<p>With a growing remit and dwindling resources, the treasurer’s job continues to get tougher. We speak to Paul Simpson about overcoming the mounting pressure on the treasury department – from demands for better forecasting to the need to keep up with industry initiatives.</p>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Paul Simpson</h4>
<h5 class="title">Managing Director and Head of Global Transaction Services</h5>
<img alt="Bank of America Merrill Lynch" class="logo org" height="34" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/bank-of-america-merrill-lynch-logo-130x34.png" width="130"/>
<p>Paul Simpson is Managing Director and Head of Global Transaction Services at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. In this role he is responsible for Global Custody and Agency Services, as well as the Global Treasury Solutions business including payments, liquidity and investments, receivables, trade, and supply chain finance. He works closely with the firm’s commercial, corporate and investment bankers to deliver the full landscape of treasury solutions to large corporate and middle market clients. He is based in New York.</p>
</div>
<p>Bank of America Merrill Lynch is one of the world’s largest financial institutions, providing a full range of banking, investing, asset management and other financial products and services. It is a leading global bank and wealth management franchise and a premier corporate and investment banking and capital market business, providing innovative services in M&amp;A, equity and debt capital raising, lending, trading, risk management, research, and liquidity and payments management. Clients and customers can expect access to a comprehensive suite of world class products, services, and expertise from an organisation that serves clients through operations in more than 40 countries and has relationships with 99% of the US Fortune 1,000 companies and 85% of the Fortune Global 500.</p>
<h5 id="what-brought-you-to-the-bank">You joined Bank of America Merrill Lynch in May this year. What brought you to the bank?</h5>
<p>There were a number of reasons for my move, but I’ll focus on three of the most compelling drivers here. The first was the success of the merger of Bank of America and Merrill Lynch and the strength of the resulting commercial banking proposition. The fact that Bank of America Merrill Lynch serves two in five middle market clients operating in the United States, and that no other bank covers this client set so extensively, was a significant factor in my decision.</p>
<p>That said, the strength of the company’s European operations should not be underestimated – we have branches throughout Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and our unique coverage provides enormous opportunities for growth in exciting markets, such as Asia and Latin America.</p>
<p>The second reason was that the role is structured in such a way that it really cuts across the entire bank – from large corporates and commercial banking clients to FIs and public sector clients. Having this good level of communication ensures that we are best placed to serve our clients holistically; something I feel strongly about in terms of service level. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is well-known for its focus on relationship and service. In fact, at my previous house, when I was competing against the company, it was well-known that winning business away from the bank was particularly hard. Now that I am on the other side, I am extremely proud of that reputation!</p>
<p>Thirdly, the Bank of America Merrill Lynch team was a huge draw for me. A number of my former colleagues had joined before me and looking at the grade of people making the move, I had to ask myself why. Aside from the impressive breadth and depth of the product offering, it was clear to me that the team the bank had in place would be able to tackle whatever came their way.</p>
<h5 id="how-have-you-spent-the-first-couple-of-months-at-the-company">How have you spent the first couple of months at the company?</h5>
<p>Although I am based in the US, I have actually spent about 90% of my time outside of the country. I have visited our offices in Hong Kong, Singapore, London and Turkey with the aim of meeting as many employees as possible, as well as spending time with our clients and listening to their needs and requirements.</p>
<p>The opportunities for us to serve our existing clients both in and outside the US are key priorities for me, so visiting these cities and regions is hugely important. Ultimately, I want to understand how we can best leverage our footprint and serve clients as a global firm. To do this, it’s absolutely essential to be on the ground and understand the key challenges in every region.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-the-main-topics-that-you-have-been-discussing-with-clients">What are the main topics that you have been discussing with clients?</h5>
<p>Of course every client is different, even within industry sectors, which is precisely why tailored cash management and trade solutions are so important. Nevertheless, common recurring priorities are payments, transparency and liquidity. These are themes that have certainly been on the treasurer’s agenda for a number of years, but they remain key issues.</p>
<p>There is still room for further efficiencies and optimisation around treasury processes. Concerns around forthcoming regulations, such as Basel III, have propelled liquidity back into the spotlight too. Elsewhere, we are working with clients on some very exciting and innovative projects, in the carbon space for example, and helping them to expand globally.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that corporates that are looking at diversifying their banking relationships will find that Bank of America Merrill Lynch is well-placed to assist them in enhancing their cash and trade operations, as well as supporting them in their growth aspirations.</p>
<h5 id="could-you-explain-a-little-more-around-how-bank-of-america-merrill-lynch-can-do-this">Could you explain a little more around how Bank of America Merrill Lynch can do this?</h5>
<p>Really, it’s about understanding each client’s business and the potential threats to and opportunities for that business. So it’s about us asking the right questions of the client. How are they expanding? Where are they investing? Where are their key markets headed in the future? Are their strategic plans sound? For those companies that are expanding outside their local and indigenous markets, one of the main ways we can provide support is by helping them to get to grips with industry specifics and regulations. On the FI side, we work hard to provide our clients with a good understanding of their position in their key markets and how they can improve on that.</p>
<p>Looking more specifically at Europe, we have also been conducting a significant amount of research among corporate treasurers, to better assess current and future priorities in the region.</p>
<h5 id="what-were-the-main-trends-that-emerged-from-that-research">What were the main trends that emerged from that research and what advice would you offer to treasurers on the back of that?</h5>
<p>There has been a shift in risk management priorities over the last 12 months – operational, credit and market risk management were all considered to be high priorities and operational risk in fact ranked more highly than it had the previous year. Elsewhere, cash flow forecasting was highlighted as a key pressure. Treasurers have a tough job right now because, post-crisis, tighter control over forecasting is required, but treasury departments are also having their resources squeezed – not an easy position to be in.</p>
<p>Two additional issues that ranked very highly were disaster contingency planning and supply chain management. I have no doubt that the terrible earthquake and subsequent tsunami in Japan were drivers behind the refocus on these topics, and corporates are right to be taking these two areas very seriously.</p>
<p>Our research has also provided insight into industry initiatives across Europe. While SEPA remains an important priority, it is still evolving in relevance for most corporates. This has no doubt been driven in part by the discussion around end-dates and the introduction of SEPA direct debits, but corporates are also beginning to realise that SEPA offers the chance to bring the receivables process fully in-house, as well as to create operational risk efficiencies.</p>
<p>I mentioned before that each company is different and therefore requires a bespoke approach – the same goes for advice. However, there are a number of strategic questions that corporates looking to future-proof their treasuries can ask themselves, such as: ‘Are you positioned in the right way?’; ‘Is your cash management wallet appropriately diversified?’; ‘What is your approach to shared service centres?’; ‘How are you going to invest your money?’; ‘Is there scope for outsourcing certain treasury functions?’</p>
<p>Corporates should also ensure they are receiving good advice around the regulatory environment and that they are getting this advice on an ongoing basis, because it’s a constantly evolving situation.</p>
<h5 id="looking-ahead,-what-are-your-priorities-for-global-treasury-solutions-at-bank-of-america-merrill-lynch">Looking ahead, what are your priorities for Global Treasury Solutions at Bank of America Merrill Lynch?</h5>
<p>Being new to the company, my priorities are to get to know the organisation as well as I can and as quickly as I can – this includes the broader Bank of America franchise. As I mentioned, I’ve already been out meeting as many clients as possible and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>I think it’s important for me to do that before settling on the strategy for the business, but I also believe from everything I’ve heard – even before I arrived – that Bank of America Merrill Lynch has a sound GTS strategy in place. So my intention is to hone in on the areas of the business that I think will really propel our clients forward, and propel us forward.</p>
<p>There are some clear priorities for continued investment and focus, such as developing our global footprint further in the emerging markets. In addition to growing our geographical coverage, we will also be increasing our product capabilities and investing further in our access platforms in those markets.</p>
<p>We want to provide clients with treasury and trade solutions wherever they do business, and I shall continue the work that’s been done over the last 18 months, adding resources to our existing teams in Asia, EMEA and Latin America. I truly believe that it’s critical to provide clients with local support, and serve them in their local language.</p>
<p>Finally, I also want to see continued investment in our trade capabilities, commercial card programme and our e-commerce platform. Another big area for us will be looking at how we leverage our custody business for our corporate and FI clients.</p>
<h5 id="how-are-you-looking-to-grow-that-programme">Focusing specifically on commercial cards, how are you looking to grow that programme and why do you feel that cards are a key product area?</h5>
<p>We have recently added Brazil, Chile, South Korea and the Philippines to our commercial cards programme, and we have plans to increase the number of countries throughout 2011 and into 2012 to meet client demand. However, it’s not just a question of coverage, it’s also important for the programme to be the best in the market. The feedback I have been getting has been very positive.</p>
<p>It’s interesting that you ask why cards are important. Perhaps cards haven’t received as much attention as they really deserve – they can bring huge benefits to corporates and form part of a robust cash management solution set. As our clients are increasingly conducting business in multiple countries and looking to grow their franchise globally, we see a growing trend for companies to adopt a global approach towards managing their purchasing and corporate travel activities.</p>
<p>Our strategy is therefore to provide card solutions wherever our clients do business. For example, for European corporates that are expanding, that may include coverage in markets such as Asia, Latin America and Africa.</p>
<h5 id="how-does-bank-of-america-merrill-lynch-differentiate-itself-from-its-competitors">The banking landscape is extremely competitive. How does Bank of America Merrill Lynch differentiate itself from its competitors?</h5>
<p>Innovation is part of Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s DNA and a real differentiator. We are continuously innovating in response to industry drivers, such as increased regulation, greater demand for cash efficiency and deeper awareness of risk. The complimentary consulting services provided by our Global Business Solutions team are an excellent example of how we at Bank of America Merrill Lynch go that extra mile for our clients – we are not simply selling them a product. The team – which provides advice, expertise and process improvement solutions for select, strategic clients to address key priorities or solve significant pain points – consists of former corporate treasurers, shared service/outsourcing and process re-engineering experts.</p>
<p>Working with clients to provide holistic, integrated solutions, the team enables clients to improve their operating model and achieve increased efficiencies. For example, the Global Business Solutions team has helped clients to free up millions of dollars of trapped cash and increased productivity by 45% in certain cash application processes.</p>
<p>Our e-commerce platform is another demonstration of innovation. CashPro® Online is our flagship product in this space and currently caters for the needs of nearly 400,000 users. The application aims to cut down the bureaucracy that takes up so much corporate time and is recognised as an industry leader, based upon the variety of its offerings, website design and functionality, its ability to attract new online customers and its service features.</p>
<h5 id="what-do-you-see-as-the-main-hurdles-on-the-horizon-for-your-clients">Moving from solutions to challenges, what do you see as the main hurdles on the horizon for your clients and what can they do to overcome them?</h5>
<p>We mentioned Basel III earlier, and the regulatory landscape remains a key challenge for corporate treasurers. Part of the issue with Basel III is the uncertainty around what the final rules will look like because the framework is still evolving, and no-one likes uncertainty.</p>
<p>It is important therefore for corporates to keep in regular contact with their bank and discuss the potential impact of forthcoming regulations. Clients could also engage in shaping the rules by lobbying alongside banks. The hope is that banks can work closely with regulators to illustrate the vital nature of cash within the treasury environment and demonstrate how the current provisions may alter buying behaviour in a way that was not intended.</p>
<p>Turning to the practicalities, treasurers will also need to look further down the line in terms of their funding options. With the introduction of Basel III, organisations may have fewer options from a credit perspective and should continue to review their cash position, so that they are able to weather stressed events. They should also look at improving their cash flow forecasting and reviewing their investment policies, processes and procedures.</p>
<p>As a final point, I would also encourage treasurers to concentrate on their supply chains and to engage with their procurement departments. It is important to know where products are being sourced and what the risks are around those sourcing practices. Is the company relying too heavily on one supplier? If a back-up supplier is put in place, are there different tax implications in the jurisdiction where they are based? In summary, it’s no longer a question of just in time; it’s a question of just in case.</p></div>

</div>
<h5 id="we-can-start-by-you-telling-us-more-about-what-that-means-to-the-asia-pacific-region">While J.P. Morgan continues increasing its presence and capabilities, perhaps we can start by you telling us more about what that means to the Asia Pacific region, particularly for companies operating in China?</h5>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span>DQ:</span> Asia Pacific is a very important region for us. What we are finding is that our US and European MNC clients have a real emphasis on the fastest growing region in the world. In addition, we have been seeing a lot of our clients who have been operating in the region for some time, are starting to do the same sort of consolidation as we saw in Europe about ten years ago by putting in shared services centres, rationalising processes, consolidating bank accounts wherever possible and really looking for opportunities to help manage trapped cash in the region.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>MY:</span> With an Asia Pacific heritage stretching back many decades and a presence in 15 markets around the region, J.P. Morgan’s core focus has always revolved around delivering an exceptional level of service to our clients. Across the region, Asian corporates are turning their eyes to the global stage, and at the same time, we’re seeing a much greater demand from global companies seeking to build their footprint in Asia. This two-way trend is emerging as a defining characteristic of the region’s dynamic growth story, and as a firm, we are innovating, investing and hiring to ensure we continue to provide a leading suite of solutions to meet this client demand.</p>
<p>This year, we celebrate our 90<sup>th</sup> anniversary in China, an important milestone in an exciting market. With five branches in China and growing, we are committed to delivering holistic solutions to our clients in China, who are rapidly growing in confidence, sophistication and ambition as they shift their focus offshore. Supporting our China clients with a range of services, notably our RMB international trade settlement program capabilities and our recent partnership with SINOSURE, we are well placed to continue playing an important role in the development of China’s financial markets.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="how-does-your-service-model-differ-from-supporting-domestic-companies-in-the-region">How does your service model differ from supporting domestic companies in the region to that of the subsidiaries of US and/or European companies?</h5>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>MY:</span> Tailoring our service models to meet the needs of our wide and varied client base is a fundamentally important aspect of our client servicing proposition. To support our domestic clients, we provide dedicated regional and in-country teams covering client servicing, product development, operations and technology, among others, ensuring that we provide on-ground support for their operations and an infrastructure that allows them to integrate effectively and efficiently with their regional subsidiaries. Understanding the local regulatory environment and how it is evolving, the unique business practices of a particular market and the challenges that our clients face in their day-to-day operations are also crucial. At an international level, we also have dedicated teams covering outbound requirements for Asia Pacific headquartered companies, and we draw on our regional and global franchise to ensure we deliver on their intra-Asia, Europe, Middle East, Africa and Americas requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span>DQ:</span> We believe we have a different service model to some of our other competitors in the industry. What we find is it’s really important to put our service people in the country where our customers are located. So, if clients are locating their main operations to China, Singapore, Hong Kong or Malaysia we will put their key customer service person in that country.</p>
<p>Having said that, we have a lot of flexibility in how we handle customer service so if a customer deals from a centralised location out of say, California for example, and they manage all of their business globally, we will locate their dedicated service person close to them.</p>
<p>Typically, our service model is tailored client by client. So if we have a client running a regional treasury centre (RTC) in Singapore with treasury functions in say six key countries in the region, we work with the client on establishing the most appropriate service model to meet their requirements; it could be a single service person for the region or a service person who supports the Singapore RTC plus six in-country service persons to support local needs.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="can-you-explain-what-this-is-and-how-it-will-help-chinese-companies">J.P. Morgan and SINOSURE recently signed a landmark Export Credit Insurance policy agreement. Can you explain what this is and how it will help Chinese companies?</h5>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span>DQ:</span> Firstly, we find this an extremely exciting initiative and it is similar to what we’ve done with the other Export-Import institutions. Under the agreement we will provide a range of trade finance solutions to Chinese exporters, enabling them to enter new markets they previously couldn’t consider and will assist these enterprises by providing trade finance operations, improving their efficiency and reducing their risk. What’s so important about this credit insurance policy is that it facilitates providing important capital at the best possible price because we have a policy in place that helps us manage the risk appropriately so it provides credit to companies that need credit and facilitates business growth and revenue. This is a fairly recent project for us but it is going very well so far.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>MY:</span> Our new partnership with SINOSURE will be instrumental in transforming the way Chinese companies conduct their business. By simplifying the often complex cross-border trade finance process, Chinese companies can focus more intently on building their business outside China while at the same time capitalising on their tremendous growth opportunities across the region. Following last year’s free trade agreement between China and the ASEAN nations, sales to the region have grown by 30%. This agreement will help Chinese companies make the most of this opportunity.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="how-would-you-summarise-your-clients-key-needs-in-the-region">How would you summarise your clients’ key needs in the region and how are you responding to them?</h5>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>MY:</span> As our Asia Pacific clients become increasingly sophisticated, we are seeing an overwhelming thirst for deeper insight into treasury management processes, tools and best practices as they move to the next level. Our client partnerships are based around delivering to our customers a strategic advisory service that will help them gain a competitive edge over their peers and better position themselves to achieve their growth objectives – whatever those objectives may be.</p>
<p>From a practical perspective, we’re seeing some interesting trends. For example, there is a commonality between clients in this region and clients in Europe or the US, in the sense that treasury now enjoys much greater visibility as an integral function to a company’s business, a higher profile which in turn places greater demands on the treasurer. Accordingly, the treasurer’s remit is expanding quickly, with previously peripheral considerations such as involvement in non-traditional treasury re-engineering projects, including cards, insurance and enterprise risk management, to name just a few, moving to the centre of the conversation. Given the diverse basket of currencies in the region, combined with some unique local market regulations, managing FX and liquidity risk is front and centre in discussions with our Asia Pacific clients. Finally, trapped cash as companies accumulate earnings is often an issue in certain markets, in which case, enhancing yield and mitigating counterparty exposure becomes a key priority for clients.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span>DQ:</span> This too (trapped cash) arises in many conversations I have in the US with our MNC’s doing business in the region. Conversations around visibility into what’s going on from a cash perspective are common. What we find is our clients need information to better understand the different regulations in the region. So for example, an operating facility in China will need help in getting the necessary regulatory approval and we are finding this is a frequent request coming through.</p>
<p>As Margaret says, liquidity management is a key theme and many of our clients have significant sums of trapped cash in the region. This is especially true for US MNCs generating anywhere between 50-70% of their revenues offshore and they want a bank that can help them to maximise their working capital in those trapped cash countries. We are developing and advising on optimal liquidity management structures in the region which are pretty ground-breaking.</p>
<p>We are also responding to the need among our clients for multi-banking capabilities. J.P. Morgan has strong relationships with many of the largest banks in the region which ties us to the best banks in-country through the use of some sophisticated technology.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-are-the-fundamental-differences-of-operating-there-as-opposed-to-the-rest-of-asia-pacific">Finally, as you continue to increase your presence in China, what are the fundamental differences of operating there as opposed to the rest of Asia Pacific and what should a foreign subsidiary look at doing to mitigate any potential risk?</h5>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span>DQ:</span> I would say the fundamental difference of operating in China versus the rest of the region, are the regulations and the fact it is a restricted country. The rules are rapidly changing in that market and, as a bank operating in China we need to stay abreast of these changes.</p>
<p>As a client sets up its business practices in China I think that it’s really important they work with a bank that has access to the regulatory bodies and also has a strong and deep expertise in that country and understands what the changing rules and regulations are so they can advise on how a client is structuring to avoid any potential pitfalls and to mitigate risk wherever possible. J.P. Morgan remains committed to helping its clients in China.</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p>As of 31<sup>st</sup> March, 2011, Morgan Stanley Investment Management had more than 640 investment professionals worldwide who managed and supervised over $275 billion in assets for institutional and intermediary investors from around the globe. With 48 offices in 21 countries MSIM serves a diverse client base of institutional investors, including corporations, endowments, foundations, central banks, government establishments, sovereign wealth funds, health-service organisations, financial institutions, public funds, and union and industry pension plans.</p>

<p>Mark Allen is a head of International Liquidity Sales within MSIM Global Liquidity Management and is responsible for developing the business across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. He joined Morgan Stanley in September 2010 and has 25 years of industry experience, of which the last nine have been in investment management. Prior to joining the firm, Mark worked at Goldman Sachs Asset Management where he was Head of Liquidity Distribution for the EMEA region. Prior to this, Mark worked at Barclays Global Investors, also in liquidity distribution.</p>

<h5 id="how-well-has-the-money-market-fundindustry-responded-to-the-challenges-of-thepast-12-months">How well has the money market fundindustry responded to the challenges of thepast 12 months?</h5>
<p>There is a clear need for those involved with the money market fund (MMF) industry to play an active role in defining and driving positive change. Over the last year, a lot of work has gone into looking at regulatory change here at Morgan Stanley, and through my role as a Director of the industry body for MMFs – the Institutional Money Market Funds Association (IMMFA) – we have been fully involved with the excellent work IMMFA has done in drafting a revised code of practice. The new code reflects the desire of the global industry – outside of the US domestic market – to, for example, ensure minimum liquidity requirements (which require no less than 10% of net assets should mature the next business day and no less than 20% within the next week), that frequent stress testing of portfolios takes place, and that greater transparency is available to clients.</p>
<p>In addition, the European Securities and Markets Authority (formerly CESR) has been active in looking at money market funds and has provided a new definition of short term money market funds (<a href="#assessing-credit-risk">see box</a>). IMMFA worked hard to influence that process which is another positive step.</p>
<p>We at Morgan Stanley would like to see this process go further to create a single, Europe-wide, tight and robust definition that would include funds which are AAA IMMFA style funds only, and thus more clearly distinguish the most risk averse funds.</p>
<h5 id="what-do-clients-look-for-in-a-money-market-fund-provider-today">What do clients look for in a money market fund provider today?</h5>
<p>Undoubtedly, there have been changes in the priorities that clients have when looking at fund providers today versus three years ago:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Credit plays a bigger part in the discussion</h5>
<p>– the size, scope, experience and quality of the credit analysts and the processes they use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Transparency has become a key theme</h5>
<p>– how much information does a fund provider make available to clients, how often and how easily?</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Access is a significant demand</h5>
<p>– how willing are credit analysts, portfolio managers and senior management to make themselves available to meet with clients and spend time explaining portfolio composition and market views.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Liquidity has become a priority</h5>
<p>– it was loss of liquidity within some money market funds rather than a loss of principal that surprised some clients in the crisis.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="how-important-is-credit-analysis-as-a-differentiator-between-money-market-funds-and-other-short-term-investment-products-and-also-between-providers">How important is credit analysis as a differentiator between money market funds and other short-term investment products, and also between providers?</h5>
<p>It is fundamental. And I think that credit analysis has always formed a very important part of the way in which the best money market funds are constructed. That is certainly the case at Morgan Stanley. What has changed is the extent to which clients want to understand greater and greater levels of detail about the process and the extent to which they want to have access to the individuals performing those roles.</p>
<p>The number of clients who want to talk to credit analysts has increased dramatically. Four or five years ago, 95% of client interactions would have been through the fund provider’s relationship managers, with the rest being with portfolio managers. That has shifted to a higher proportion wanting access to the portfolio managers and the introduction of clients talking to the credit analysts that I think is genuinely new.</p>
<p>We have very deliberately put client access at the heart of what we do in the Morgan Stanley Global Liquidity business – giving the client direct access to credit analysts and having relationship managers who are willing and able to take them to meetings. This is an unusual approach and it is a differentiator. Access to the source of the credit analysis and openness surrounding the process is key and that is very valuable to clients.</p>
<h5 id="has-credit-analysis-changed-in-the-new-market-environment">Has credit analysis changed in the new market environment?</h5>
<p>The work the credit analysts do has not changed greatly in terms of methodology in firms like Morgan Stanley because there was a rigorous process before and still is today. But clients want to understand more about it. There is also a greater awareness that credit analysis in money market funds is different to the type of credit analysis that is done in a fixed income portfolio. In the latter the analysis will focus on default risk and valuation, while in a money market fund the risk of a downgrade is a major additional consideration. This means that money fund providers need a different skillset and analytical framework, and clients have become much more aware of this. Also, they are much more interested in understanding the quality, depth and breadth of the credit team and much more focused on the organisation sponsoring the fund and the inherent expertise of that organisation to undertake credit analysis.</p>
<h5 id="inherent-expertise">Inherent expertise?</h5>
<p>It has become more important to be able to demonstrate that an ability to execute high quality credit analysis is fundamental to a firm’s business and that the firm has a demonstrable competency in that area. Morgan Stanley is clearly a firm in that category and clients recognise it as such. This is absolutely the core of what we do as an organisation and so we commit very significant resources to it and constantly monitor those activities. This differentiates firms such as Morgan Stanley from providers for whom the analysis of credit risk is not a fundamental driver of their business and is therefore, to some extent, a bolt-on and a very clear differentiator from providers which do not undertake additional credit analysis at all.</p>
<h5 id="how-can-clients-differentiate-on-this-basis">How can clients differentiate on this basis?</h5>
<p>The first level of reassurance is that the fund should be an IMMFA fund. The second is the ratings – as an IMMFA fund they will be AAA rated by a rating agency, but there are funds which are rated AAA by more than one agency and we would argue that the greater number of agencies the better, since that means the fund must adhere to the strictest criteria of each agency. The third level of reassurance is – does a fund do its own credit analysis? That does not mean simply making sure that everything in the fund is A1/P1 as dictated by the rating agency. It means taking that A1/P1 universe and passing it to the credit analysts for the detailed, comprehensive and continuous analysis I referred to above.</p>
<h5 id="and-how-can-clients-evaluate-the-quality-of-credit-teams">And how can clients evaluate the quality of credit teams?</h5>
<p>Let me describe Morgan Stanley’s approach, which we believe to be best in class, with the implication that it makes for a good comparator for any client looking across providers.</p>
<p>We have four dedicated liquidity analysts who focus solely on evaluation of short term money market credits. Two of those team members each have over 25 years of industry experience in money markets and looking at drivers of liquidity in the credit markets. In addition, we have 13 sector analysts who focus their experience within industry verticals along the full credit curve, meaning that they are tasked with establishing and maintaining both liquidity (short term) and credit (long term) views. Having multiple sets of experienced eyes gauging changes in credit conditions and financial performance is critical in protecting investors’ money and earning a reasonable return for a given set of risks.</p>
<p>Our team is organised by sector and geography. That team sets the limits for nominal amounts and duration limits for credits with which they are comfortable. All analysis carried out must be presented to a credit committee consisting of a wider group of portfolio managers and other analysts and other fixed income experts. This provides another level of safety in that there is not a reliance simply on the unexamined view of a single credit analyst. There is peer review. There are challenges to their view and there is ongoing monitoring. Positions are not parked and then left.</p>
<div class="boxed">
<h5 id="assessing-credit-risk">Assessing credit risk</h5>
<p>Morgan Stanley uses a multi-disciplinary approach to evaluating and monitoring credit risk. Holistically, we view owning a bond as equivalent to being long a treasury security and being short a put option on the firm’s assets (similar to the Merton model approach). We look at the implied asset volatility of the firm as a form of measurement of the distance to default on the liabilities of the firm. The greater the volatility of the underlying assets, the greater the potential for those assets to fall below the value of the firm’s liabilities.</p>
<p>We use equity implied volatility as an input into the forecast of asset volatility, and thus have a measureable quantum of risk from the equity markets that gives us a view on the implied probability of default. When we begin to combine other market-based metrics with fundamental bottoms up research, we are able to triangulate on a view of credit and liquidity that brings a more robust analysis.</p>
<p>In the early spring of 2010, our models took market data from the slope and level of credit default swap curves, equity volatility skew, inversion of the equity volatility curve, and other market measures, and signalled that certain peripheral European banks had significant liquidity risk priced into their market securities. While our fundamental long term view of the credits remained constructive due to these banks’ improving capital ratios, diversity of their revenue and assets, and their strong domestic funding base (among other factors), our shorter term view of liquidity risk remained negative, which was augmented by the signals we were gathering from the market.</p>
<p>We avoided investing in the short term paper of these names as money market spreads rose with growing concerns of the Greek sovereign situation, weak domestic growth figures and upcoming European bank stress tests. Our decision to remove such names from our investible universe helped our funds avoid the risk and volatility associated with subsequent rating downgrades of some of those institutions, as the larger sovereign funding issue became increasingly precarious with trickle down impact to the major financial institutions domiciled there.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-are-clients-demanding-in-terms-of-disclosure-and-transparency">What are clients demanding in terms of disclosure and transparency?</h5>
<p>We are trying in every way to be as open as we can. Clients want more transparency – they want us to share more information with them, and they want better disclosure – they want that information released to them more quickly and in a more timely fashion.</p>
<p>For example, as CFOs have become more concerned about credit conditions in Europe, treasurers have been asked about aggregate exposure to certain countries. Those using a variety of providers or funds were faced with a manual and time-consuming task of creating that aggregate figure, often from fund data that was days or weeks old. So we, in response to client feedback, changed our weekly portfolio holdings report to show country exposure. And we hope this will encourage other providers to do the same thing, so that treasurers using multiple providers can obtain their aggregate exposures more easily.</p>
<p>We had already moved the portfolio report from being available every fortnight to being available every week on a Tuesday, with the report reflecting the holdings from the preceding Friday, which means as close to zero lag as is reasonably possible with current technology. We also show CUSIP and ISIN numbers where possible, so that treasurers can look up individual securities themselves should they wish to do so.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we’ve added the weighted average life (WAL) measure to our daily reports as well as the more usual monthly factsheets. This provides useful information on the fund’s duration risk because it takes account of the legal final maturity of floating rate notes rather than the weighted average maturity (WAM) which uses the next re-set date instead. With awareness of the value of tracking the WAL growing, we believe it’s a material benefit for clients to have this information available daily.</p>
<p>To take another example, we don’t simply provide a selection of views from our credit analysts, but as I mentioned earlier, we take them to meetings with us so that clients can quiz them directly.</p>
<p>Finally, one of the things that we have been asked to put together by clients very recently is a credit commentary alongside the portfolio commentary and we’re working on this right now.</p>
<p>The message is that Morgan Stanley are continually looking to build the business and to do so in a way which is led by clients. We ask people what they want and we develop it for them. I believe it’s these incremental steps that make a critical difference in the market.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>The corporate treasurer has a far more difficult and extensive set of issues to deal with today than ever previously, not least in the area of foreign exchange. We talk to Lloyds’ Rob Garwood about how to navigate the latest economic, operational and regulatory developments.</p>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Rob Garwood</h4>
<h5 class="title">Managing Director and Head of FX Solutions, Sales and Derivatives Structuring</h5>
<img alt="Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets logo" class="logo org" height="25" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/lloyds-bank-corporate-markets-logo-2012-120x25.png" title="Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets" width="120"/>
<p>Rob Garwood is Managing Director and Head of FX Solutions, Sales and Derivatives Structuring at Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets. He has worked extensively in foreign exchange markets on both the client buyside and the sellside and is responsible for the delivery of the bank’s range of currency products to both financial institutions and corporate segments globally.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-trends-are-you-currently-seeing-in-the-fx-market">What trends are you currently seeing in the FX market?</h5>
<p>I think there are five key trends worth noting in the FX markets today that are having an impact on how our clients manage their currency exposures and on their operations generally.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The global economy is potentially at a turning point. We have seen the return of Global GDP to trend growth from the low point of 2009. Whilst that growth rate is welcome it is certainly not balanced – there is still uncertainty in the US, the UK and in peripheral Europe. You also have a degree of uncertainty over commodity prices and inflation. China and many other countries, including the UK, are facing inflationary pressures, and that in turn raises the question of when interest rates will start to rise in both the developed economies and in the key developing markets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is also significant political upheaval in certain parts of the world currently. Obviously there is the situation in the Middle East which has the potential to profoundly change the political and economic balance in the region; there are on-going regional elections in Europe which will affect how budgetary issues are being handled now and in the future in countries such as Ireland, Portugal and Greece.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the foreign exchange market perspective volumes continue to increase and, importantly, we have also seen a jump in the volatility of volatility. In other words, markets are now switching from low volatility to high volatility and back again, rather than experiencing prolonged periods of one or the other and this clearly makes hedging decisions for corporations more complex and alpha generation for investors more difficult.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are also witnessing key operational trends: it has never been more important to provide efficient and error free services over the whole trade cycle – pre-trade, at-trade and post-trade and at Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets we are sharply focused on providing an holistic approach across all these service areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally there are several significant changes occurring to key aspects of the regulatory landscape that will have important implications for all asset classes, including currencies. Whilst we need further clarity, from a product perspective it is likely that currency options will have to be cleared on an exchange; potentially some longer dated forwards will also have to be treated in this way; and in both the corporate and institutional client bases there may also be regulatory changes that affect a client’s ability to use certain types of financial products and solution.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="how-are-fx-related-risks-changing-from-a-corporate-clients-perspective">How are FX-related risks changing from a corporate client’s perspective?</h5>
<p>The more general answer to this question is that the average corporate treasurer has a far more difficult and extensive set of issues to deal with today than they have had previously!</p>
<p>Specifically, and in addition to the key trends that I have already identified, and in particular the increase in the volatility of volatility, one important development is the continued globalisation of corporate activity. Whether large or small, more corporates are finding themselves moving into new markets, in pursuit of growth and diversification. This is bringing them into increasing contact with a broader range of currency exposures, whether that is through trade or direct foreign investment via M&amp;A activity or direct financial asset investments. This trend will continue and in turn raises the question of how clients manage and hedge these exposures. We will continue to see a higher share of global GDP coming from emerging market economies with a consequent increase in FX flows, exposures and hence a greater impact on corporate balance sheets from these regions.</p>
<p>One other trend that will affect corporates’ FX-related risks is the evolution of hedge accounting regulations in both Europe and the US. The regulations have previously made certain types of hedging difficult if not impossible. Suggested changes to these rules may well allow corporates to increase the scope of their hedging activity. Certainly hedge accounting is a primary concern among the treasurers that we speak to and since IAS 39 and its revisions apply to core hedging activities, such as forecasting revenues and costs, debt exposure in foreign currencies and handling exposures from other cross-border activity such as M&amp;A, they correctly see any changes to the accounting regime as having potentially large effects.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-the-key-strengths-at-lloyds-bank-corporate-markets">What are the key strengths at Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets?</h5>
<p>Lloyds has an extremely strong client proposition in foreign exchange, in both the major corporate space and also with financial institutions. Our strength in Sterling, from both a flow and from a research perspective is a key advantage. Sterling is often a core currency for International corporate entities and, regardless of where clients are based, most have exposures in the currency. Our research in this area is leading edge and, coupled with our market share in the Sterling market, we are able to advise our clients strategically and execute their business in a sophisticated and efficient manner.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have a significant structuring group offering the client accounting, risk and derivative structuring solutions. By combining this team with our research product and first class relationship management teams across a broad spectrum of corporate sectors we are in a strong position to help clients through these more difficult times.</p>
<p>We were particularly pleased to see that our holistic approach to servicing our corporate clients has received such favourable client feedback. For example, the most recent Greenwich survey in the UK corporate space voted Lloyds number one for overall quality of service.</p>
<h5 id="how-can-you-help-clients-to-manage-and-mitigate-fx-related-risks">How can you help clients to manage and mitigate FX-related risks?</h5>
<p>At the most basic level we have the research, distribution, trading and execution capabilities necessary to service the corporate sector from the small commercial corporate through to the largest, most sophisticated multinational companies.</p>
<p>Most significantly though, this is a period of time in which banks’ intellectual capital has never been more important and we have the skills and platform to gain trusted advisor status with our clients.</p>
<p>To understand and serve clients better we are sector based both at the relationship management level and at the sales level allowing us to be entirely aligned to our client needs. To support those clients our structuring teams help clients understand the impact of financial markets on their businesses both from an interest rate and foreign exchange perspective. The team offer financial solutions to meet those needs and risk sensitivities whether their requirements be in hedging and risk mitigation solutions or through advice on accounting issues, Basel III or even Solvency II planning.</p>
<p>When you then consider our extensive sales force, structuring and research teams, add the lending resources the bank can mobilise for our corporate clients, and couple that with best in class Relationship Management then I believe we have a have a very powerful client proposition.</p>
<h5 id="can-you-describe-the-process-you-use-to-determine-the-optimum-risk-management-solution-for-a-client">Can you describe the process you use to determine the optimum risk management solution for a client?</h5>
<p>Our first job is to look at the clients’ needs, their risk tolerances and their exposures. We are not in the business of pushing products, especially in this environment, where the simpler, more holistic solutions are often the most effective. In complex environments corporates generally want to operate as simply as possible so it is a part of our role to give them some bandwidth to look at all of the options they have at their disposal and the hedges they wish to put in place. So, whilst the modeling that the Risk Solutions group undertakes is extremely sophisticated, we are determined to make the solutions as simple and intuitive as we can for the client.</p>
<p>We clearly need to know the risk sensitivities that each of our clients have. For those with relatively high risk tolerances, we may advise them to look at their hedging programmes over shorter time periods containing firmer market views; whilst for those with relatively low risk tolerances they may well have to look at structures that work over different periods of time with limited currency level dependencies. Again, retaining client flexibility wherever possible is always a primary objective of ours. We analyse the currencies the corporate is most heavily exposed to, consider the time periods involved and then we focus on the primary hedging solutions that fit within the selected client parameters.</p>
<p>Just moving away from foreign exchange for a moment, and looking at corporates on the liability side, we are seeing corporates globally with very high cash levels, partly because they are generating good profits but partly because of the uncertainty of the market. They are tending to maintain substantial cash balances in a very low interest rate environment. Again therefore, clients need guidance and advice in these difficult times on the balance between yield and security – on deciding what the optimal cash levels should be.</p>
<p>In both foreign exchange risk and liability management, our aim ultimately is to provide simple solutions to gain trusted adviser status with our core client franchise.</p>
<h5 id="what-plans-do-you-have-for-expansion-in-fx-over-the-next-24-months">What plans do you have for expansion in FX over the next 24 months?</h5>
<p>As I’ve outlined, we provide a first class service today to our existing clients. The aim is to build on this client proposition and to both increase our penetration of our core client base and to expand that service to a broader geographic footprint. That means moving first into continental Europe followed closely by the US and later Asia. This is about providing a set of global solutions for our core clients. From a global perspective our near term target is to move into the top 20 by volume of foreign exchange.</p>
<p>Is this realistic? Absolutely. We have a significant market capitalisation and we service our current clients well today. That level of service quality is a key differentiator and as I have already said, we have an excellent track record, backed up by the endorsement of our clients as evidenced in the Greenwich survey.</p>
<p>So this is an already successful platform which we want to deliver to an expanded group of clients.</p>
<h5 id="what-innovations-are-you-seeing-in-the-fx-area-and-how-are-you-responding">What innovations are you seeing in the FX area and how are you responding?</h5>
<p>The key point here is that the next burst of innovation in foreign exchange will not necessarily be product related, it will just as likely be in terms of the simplicity, efficiency and quality of service. One of our key initiatives is Arena, our new e-solutions platform, which we are planning to launch in the third quarter of 2011.</p>
<p>Through this we will deliver pricing capabilities, content-rich research and strategy thought pieces. We will deliver our own structuring advisory services – all through one platform – and over time we will be delivering those same services across other asset classes as well, primarily in the debt space.</p>
<p>It is important to stress that we have tried very hard not to make this a product push. Instead, we have spoken to our client base and asked them for their view on how tomorrow’s e-solution platform should look. We have then liaised with them continuously through the product development cycle by way of a client advisory board; and that board has provided constant feedback to us to ensure we deliver a client-required product that supports their longer-term goals.</p>
<p>Again, this will enable us to win and maintain trusted advisor status by supporting the client through the whole business cycle. So, whether it is through simple execution facilities, whether it is risk mitigation advice or whether it is alpha generation ideas, I believe that Arena will provide a valuable platform that enhances the client experience with us.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Since joining Barclays in January 2011, Maurice Cleaves has been focused on developing the bank’s cash management strategy and global footprint. Treasury Today spoke to Maurice about his goals for the coming years and the challenges currently faced by the bank’s corporate clients.</p>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Maurice Cleaves</h4>
<h5 class="title">Global Head of Cash Management</h5>
<img alt="Barclays Corporate logo" class="logo org" height="27" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/barclays-corporate-logo-2012-90x27.png" title="Barclays Corporate" width="90"/>
<p>Maurice Cleaves joined from Deutsche Bank, where for the past four years he was responsible for the EMEA region Cash Management Product organisation. During this time he had the responsibility for building and managing an EMEA proposition.</p>
<p>Prior to Deutsche Bank, Maurice was at J.P. Morgan Chase for 26 years, holding positions in Operations, Product and Business Management, Sales, Product Development and Risk Management with the Cash Management, Securities Clearance and Corporate Trust businesses. Maurice has also been a Director of SWIFT UK, CHAPS, APACS and a Director of the UK Payments Council.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="how-would-you-describe-barclays-existing-cash-management-strategy">How would you describe Barclays existing cash management strategy?</h5>
<p>I’ve been at Barclays a month now and the focus has been on defining where Barclays fits in the competitive business of cash management – what we provide for our clients, and where we have opportunity for growth.</p>
<p>Prior to joining Barclays, I worked for Deutsche Bank, and for J.P. Morgan Chase before that. In both of these roles, I was working in the global cash management business and one of the key building blocks of an effective cash management business is the ‘home market’. This is the bedrock on which the cash management business is built, it provides strength and stability within the franchise and a client base of strong relationships. The ‘home markets’ of those banks are clearly different to that of Barclays and each of the banks has a unique ‘home market’.</p>
<p>In the UK, Barclays has a significant presence, with some client relationships which go back over 200 years.</p>
<p>My sense is that outside of the UK, we have pockets of expertise and pockets of influence that we need to bring together. So, part of our global cash management strategy is firstly an investment programme that brings together our countries where our expertise lies and secondly grows out the areas where perhaps we’re under-penetrated.</p>
<p>In doing so, we need to bear in mind that we will need to continue to focus on the UK where our corporate client base is the strongest. The way that we will grow and shape our cash management business will partly be on the basis of where our ‘home market’ is, partly on where our expertise is currently, and partly where we need to follow our clients and grow our geographical footprint.</p>
<p>The balance of these three pieces over the coming months and years will take the Barclays cash management business where it needs to be as a recognised global player.</p>
<p>Because of the changing nature of the banking industry across Europe, and the strength of Barclays rating, there is now a place for Barclays in Europe following on from the success that BarCap has had in certain markets. The banking landscape has changed: banks have exited, merged, or been downgraded. So, where corporate treasurers rely on bank ratings, strength of balance sheet and strength of bank coupled with excellent service, there is definitely a place for us.</p>
<p>We are investing in the business and there has been a major reorganisation in the past year from Barclays Commercial into Barclays Corporate. The senior management has changed, the focus has changed and the level of investment has changed. We are now very much looking to grow, in order to follow our clients to the major locations around the globe, to help them with their global cash management needs.</p>

We are now very much looking to grow, in order to follow our clients to the major locations around the globe, to help them with their global cash management needs.</p>
<h5 id="which-locations-in-particular-are-you-focusing-on">Which locations in particular are you focusing on?</h5>
<p>Our strategy is first and foremost a regional approach.</p>
<p>The first region we are focusing on is Europe. Following years of change in the European cash management space, it’s the right time for Barclays to take advantage of that. We’re not burdened with a legacy structure, which puts us in a good position to build for the new European environment.</p>
<p>We will focus on Germany, where we are probably under-penetrated, compared with some of our competitors. Our aspirations in Germany are that we already have our Barclays Capital business and some very good client connections there. We now need to offer them pan-European cash management capabilities which incorporate the strongest European economy. We’ve opened up the other services of our European operations to our German clients – so we’re already booking substantial business there.</p>
<p>In terms of the second region, we believe that we have a unique proposition in Africa, as a bank with significant in-country banking facilities in many African countries. The African countries were historically a very difficult place to do business, but over time, Barclays has built up a very solid and secure franchise for cash management and trade business there.</p>
<p>Additionally, in some of the African countries, we have a branch network, and therefore a comprehensive delivery capability. We want to bring the power of that to our clients.</p>
<p>I think the third area that we’ve got to focus on is trade flows between the UK and the US. Our clients are very much involved in those trade flows and we therefore need to build out the Barclays franchise in a sensible way in the US.</p>
<p>Of course, with the addition of the Lehman business to Barclays Capital, we have become a fairly significant business in the US and that gives a platform to grow.</p>
<p>Cash Management and Trade are natural extensions of business for these clients and we need to develop a broader relationship to capture these opportunities.</p>
<p>Outside of those three regions, we have other locations around the world where we do business. The next strand of our strategy will be to bring that into a global cash management offering.</p>
<h5 id="do-you-have-a-timetable-in-mind">Do you have a timetable in mind?</h5>
<p>There’s a short, medium and longer term plan. In the short term, we’re growing out what we can in Europe. In the medium term, we’ll be focusing on Africa and the US and in the longer term, the rest of it will come together. So we’re probably looking at one, three and five year horizons respectively.</p>
<h5 id="how-are-you-planning-to-develop-your-product-offering">How are you planning to develop your product offering?</h5>
<p>A basic aspect of all business is that you have to offer competitive products and therefore product innovation is key. While we do have product innovation capability in every country in which we operate, our UK business has traditionally been the place where this innovation has been most advanced.</p>
<p>In the UK market, we’ve had some amazing success with some very sharp products, and there is a programme underway to migrate those in simple terms into Western Europe and ultimately to Africa and so on.</p>
<p>These are products that have served our clients’ needs extremely well in the past 12 months, and our European operations have an appetite to bring those products in and expand those onto the European client base. That said, each country does have some unique characteristics and we’re very sensitive to our clients’ needs on a standalone basis in each market.</p>
<p>I think that all global banks are focused on developing their systems environment at the moment, and that’s not dissimilar to what Barclays Corporate is doing.</p>
<p>We’re looking to roll out new platforms, new overlays and new client interfaces, to support them in each of the regions where they want to do business.</p>
<h5 id="what-challenges-will-you-face-in-implementing-all-of-this">What challenges will you face in implementing all of this?</h5>
<p>I think most of the challenge is determining just how much you can do in a short space of time. Quite often, these things take time, because they are heavily reliant on systems, stability and robust project management. Any change of the core infrastructure needs to planned and executed really well because very often it is like changing the engine while the car is moving. We will focus on doing the basics well, providing timeliness and transparency of information back to clients in a timely manner and having highly efficient transaction throughput.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-the-key-challenges-corporate-treasurers-are-facing-today">What are the key challenges corporate treasurers are facing today?</h5>
<p>Corporate treasurers have got a number of challenges today that they didn’t have in the past. They have the challenge of which bank providers they use; the challenge of keeping cash flow consistent within their own company environment; new regulations to follow for their own business and the challenge that some of the sources of cash flow control have changed over the past two or three years. They also have the challenge that some of the banks that in the past they may have wanted to work with, or have worked with, are not the same banks as they are today. So I think that they have a tricky ‘balancing act’ to ensure efficiency and compliance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the treasurer is much more visible at Board level than they were before. In the past, they may have been viewed as the guys that made sure that everything knitted together from a supply chain point of view; a job well done was the standard expected. Now, the treasury department has become more visible and has had to be far more innovative. They’re the people who keep the company solvent through the management of liquidity and cash flow and so their position has been elevated in recent times.</p>
<p>In terms of where we fit with that, I think corporate treasurers have become much more demanding of their banks and the services that the banks offer. I also think they require a lot more transparency – for example, over intraday liquidity that they have, or the week-to-week or month-to-month liquidity that they have. They need to have a much closer relationship with their bankers to ensure that there is a like-minded thinking anticipating need on both sides.</p>
<p>The business has become much more complex as clients have diversified or become more international. In theory, it’s great if you can get one bank that can help you with account visibility, control of funds, reconciliation, reporting etc, across multiple jurisdictions. But, the corollary to that is that you don’t want to ‘put all your eggs in one basket’! Clients are more discerning and banks have evolved post crisis. Corporate treasurers look far more closely at counterparty risk and banks are assessed on their ratings and CDS spreads.</p>
<p>Whilst for operational efficiency and simplicity some clients may want to use one bank for all services and operations, diversity is key to managing risk and they are actually spreading that risk across a number of banks and placing cash into rated investment funds. Banks with stronger ratings in weaker countries have benefited from this in their presence countries.</p>
<p>Regulation of banks has forced a segmentation of the types of cash products that they offer. From the banks’ point of view, we have a very different view of the stable operational cash that our clients place with us, from the ‘hot money’ that moves around the market overnight. This encourages more planning from the treasurer to take advantage of this.</p>
<h5 id="what-sort-of-advice-are-your-corporate-clients-looking-for-currently">What sort of advice are your corporate clients looking for currently?</h5>
<p>A lot of the advice they are looking for is around cash and trade flows: what’s the best method? What’s the most secure? How can they move monies around the world to pay for goods and services? How is liquidity made available? What new products and techniques are available to them?</p>
<p>Every bank aspires to take on the role of ‘trusted advisor’ for its clients – not least ourselves. If we feel we’re very much on the same side of the table as our treasurers, in terms of what the contingencies are, what the alternatives are for funding and liquidity, then, increasingly we’re seen as part of a solution by them.</p>
<h5 id="how-high-on-the-corporate-agenda-is-forecasting">How high on the corporate agenda is forecasting?</h5>
<p>Very high, and probably higher than it’s ever been before. Everybody can see what a lack of liquidity can do to any company. It’s the old story: plenty of profitable companies collapse because they haven’t got their liquidity right. Forecasting is about having contingency and alternative.</p>
<p>A lot of the products we design have ranges attached to them – we allow movements on the account; we reward the average balance, rather than forcing clients to deposit tranches for fixed periods. We’ve come up with a very flexible product range to meet contingencies to cover potential forecasting errors.</p>
<h5 id="what-developments-in-the-industry-do-you-expect-to-see-over-the-next-12-months">What developments in the industry do you expect to see over the next 12 months?</h5>
<p>Certainly more regulation on liquidity. Obviously, we want all banks to be solvent, but we don’t want solvency to cause restrictions on what we can offer to our clients, so we have to watch that closely.</p>
<p>Another thing to note is that if we really believe we’re coming out of this economic downturn and into a new more expansive economic cycle, businesses will need to take advantage of new markets and the changing world order. Barclays Corporate expects to help clients with those new markets.</p>
<p>In my discussions with treasurers there is a feeling that there is a lot more work to do in the area of corporate governance. We recently spoke to a big high street name client that is saying corporate governance no longer allows them to place funds for longer than overnight. There’s quite a strong development for names that large to say that they can’t commit to more than a single night on any bank.</p>
<p>Corporates are taking the lead in many cases to forge their own strength in governance, implementing new policies to provide clarity of strategy. Some of that would look quite tough to the outside world, but it’s obviously there for a reason. Given what’s happened in the last few years, corporates are making sure they’re on a more stable footing to ensure that they can withstand any future shocks.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>In 2010 Treasury Today conducted its first European Benchmarking Study – in association with J.P. Morgan – into the field of corporate treasury. The Benchmarking Study canvassed the opinions of over 450 corporates from across the continent and has since published its findings on a range of topics including cash and liquidity management, risk management, supply chain, technology and bank relationships.</p>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Steven Victorin</h4>
<h5 class="title">Managing Director</h5>
<img alt="J.P. Morgan logo" class="logo org" height="20" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/jpmorgan-logo-2012-100x20.png" title="J.P. Morgan" width="100"/>
<p>Steven Victorin is Managing Director and leads the Treasury Services sales activities across the EMEA region delivering solutions to overcome the complex challenges of Corporates, Financial Institutions and Public Sector clients of J.P. Morgan. His corporate sales teams are responsible for providing treasury advisory, working capital management, and core transaction-based services.</p>
<p>Steven is a global stakeholder in the development and deployment of the global corporate segment strategy for the Treasury Services business. Throughout his career, he has held a number of leadership positions in developing complete, tailored financial solutions to companies around the world while working in partnership with product companies, corporate banking, risk management and M&amp;A advisory.</p>
</div>
<p>In this interview, we speak to Steven Victorin to gain an insight into the results of the Study and current industry trends.</p>
<h5 id="did-any-of-the-responses-to-the-study-come-as-a-surprise">Did any of the responses to the Study come as a surprise?</h5>
<p>It was interesting that so many people focused on the core components:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>credit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>relationships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>supply chain finance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These were key themes.</p>
<p>I’d say overall, the majority of the results were not surprising and validated what our clients have been telling us. Having said that, I was slightly surprised that only a quarter of respondents cited regulation as a key concern as this tends to be a consistent theme in the meetings that I have with treasurers.</p>
<p>It’s true to say that much of the regulation is initially affecting the banking industry and maybe there is a view that this is not an issue for the treasurer. If this is the common viewpoint, then the banks have an obligation to improve their communications to their clients. Regulation such as Basel III will have an effect on day to day treasury operations. This is not just something that might affect their investment policy, but could lead to the potential in having to undergo an entire review of banking relationships due the broader costs that will be associated with financing in general.</p>
<p>Another thing that did surprise me was the results on SEPA – only six per cent of respondents had achieved substantial benefits as a result of implementing it. Anecdotally, clients have told me that they see value in SEPA when they are moving to it as part of an overall restructuring of their business. On a standalone basis it may not have enough traction yet, but if you are talking about SEPA as part of an overall restructuring of corporate treasury, people will see a lot more value.</p>

<p>On the cash and liquidity side, I thought it was interesting feedback on the type of liquidity corporates were receiving from their banks and the fact that they were looking at a fairly stable bank group – we weren’t necessarily witnessing any consolidation in relationships. Corporates are keenly focused on having the right number of banks. They are revaluating their relationships and making decisions on them.</p>
<p>I think the only reason why you’re seeing some of this feedback is because corporate Europe has not finished re-financing its back-stop facilities. In another year, we’re going to see more movement in that direction. We expect corporates to consolidate their relationships further in the future.</p>
<h5 id="do-you-believe-this-focus-will-continue-in-2011">42% of the Study’s respondents said that supply chain finance had increased in importance over the past 12 months. Do you believe this focus will continue in 2011?</h5>
<p>Absolutely. There continues to be much greater focus on how corporates can improve their cash flow cycle and also review their supplier arrangements. There are things they can do there that can be helpful to their suppliers while increasing their own working capital.</p>
<p>The challenging market conditions have been going on for such a long time. I think the environment that we’re operating in right now is not about opening the next great lockbox system. It is all about how corporates can make use of their cash flow. Cash is king, and I think you’re going to continue to see this being true for much of 2011. I think we’ll hear a lot more about cash in the next Study.</p>
<p>The subject of supply chain financing comes up in many of our conversations with clients these days. Corporates are very open to finding new, creative and simple ways to manage their cash flows. We will hear more about it because in the past it hasn’t necessarily been on all treasurers’ radars, but it is now front and centre, particularly for heavy industry distribution and manufacturing companies. These are areas where you can really step back and take a meaningful view on how to impact on the cash flow cycle.</p>
<h5 id="what-innovations-are-you-seeing-in-the-area-of-scf">What innovations are you seeing in the area of SCF?</h5>
<p>People are moving beyond the core competencies and are looking at customised or bespoke solutions. I don’t think it is necessarily a specific type of customisation that is becoming more common. I think it is the fact that clients are coming to us with very specific challenges, and with our proactive consultancy approach, we are able to work through those issues and look to provide solutions that make a complicated situation less so.</p>
<figure class="center">

<p class="source">Source: Reuters EcoWin/ECR</p>
</figure>
<p>We are also seeing corporates taking a more holistic view of procurement. From procurement of raw materials all the way down to T&amp;E; from how to get discounts from running day-to-day offices all the way up to where to source raw materials. That comes from taking a top-down view, which looks at all aspects of the cash cycle. As opposed to having procurement looking at one area and treasury at another, it is a much more straightforward process.</p>
<p>In the next Study, I think we’ll see that more treasurers are becoming involved in this area – at least in the initial stages. That’s why we’re seeing a much broader view. Decision making and change management are being sponsored at a much higher level these days.</p>
<p>I have talked to clients who have moved treasury staff into procurement as a way to leverage talent and a different perspective. I think that has helped to accelerate the process.</p>
<h5 id="why-do-you-think-these-qualities-are-a-priority">Over 50% of respondents cited relationship or service quality as the single most important factor when deciding banking relationships, irrespective of company size. Why do you think these qualities are a priority?</h5>
<p>Service quality is such a fundamental issue in this business. Once you cut through the different platforms, the competing pricing schedules and product offerings, it will fundamentally come down to relationships and how a client is valued by a bank. If you have very good consistent service quality, you are really able to make a difference for the client.</p>

</figure>
<p>The challenge is that clients cannot truly evaluate the promises made until an issue arises and they are able to engage with the customer service side of the business. When we sit with clients and discuss customer service, when they meet our people and see our facilities and understand the flexibility that we can offer, it is often hugely enlightening for all concerned. It is a change agent in the discussion.</p>
<h5 id="what-distinguishes-jp-morgan-from-other-banks-in-this-field">What distinguishes J.P. Morgan from other banks in this field?</h5>
<p>It is having the people who understand the globality of the business and our clients. Most importantly it is having a client centric culture that exists within J.P. Morgan. That’s not only about reacting quickly and efficiently to solve a day-to-day issue, it’s having the people that understand the client’s business and industry and proactively recommend improvements to the overall client experience. We look for long-term solutions that are right for the client rather than what is right for individual product P&amp;L’s. After all, our mission is to make it easier for our clients.</p>
<h5 id="how-would-jp-morgan-respond-to-that">22% of the Study’s respondents cited a lack of appropriate solutions from their banks. How would J.P. Morgan respond to that?</h5>
<p>The challenges the treasurer faces today are increasingly complex compared to what they were five years ago. The solutions today encompass strategic product bundling which requires significant development to ensure that they can meet the client’s requirements.</p>
<p>From our standpoint, we have been very vocal in the market, and with our clients, on the investment we’re making to provide solutions that meet their needs. We are working with them throughout the development process to ensure that the products that we have now, together with what we are developing are both credible and helpful in mitigating risk, improving efficiency and maximising control over a company’s cash.</p>
<p>We have been very consistent in our approach. Where there is a need we will build it for our clients. We go where our clients need us, as opposed to building a platform and then waiting for the business to follow. It is a focused strategy and it allows us to be much more responsive.</p>
<h5 id="in-2011-jp-morgan-is-additionally-supporting-the-launch-of-treasury-todays-benchmarking-studies-in-latin-america-apac-and-the-middle-east-why">In 2011, J.P. Morgan is additionally supporting the launch of Treasury Today’s Benchmarking Studies in Latin America, APAC and the Middle East. Why?</h5>
<p>I view the Studies as becoming an invaluable tool to the treasurer. They will give meaningful data in helping treasurers understand how their profession is evolving and where there are similarities, whether they come from a technical or industry standpoint.</p>
<p>Launching the Study globally will, I hope, additionally help in sharing best practice by segment and/or region. Once established, it will be fascinating to see what differences exist, say within the tech and pharma companies, or how the same segment operates in different regions. It could become the catalyst for adopting best practice.</p>
<p>For J.P. Morgan, these Studies are a tool that allows us to verify the challenges we hear from our clients and whether they are common to a particular region and/or segment, and how we can, as their financial partner, deliver the solution that makes a real difference.</p>
<p>Over 450 individuals took the time to respond to an in-depth European questionnaire. It would be remiss of us not to take on board the results, validate them with our clients and act accordingly.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Regarded by EU policymakers as a further step along the path to full monetary union, SEPA, or the Single Euro Payments Area, has yet to capture the imagination of most corporates. With the European Commission expected to announce an end-date for full migration in the near future, we speak to Tony Richter, Head of Strategic Business Development at HSBC, about the obstacles and opportunities the scheme presents for corporate clients.</p>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Tony Richter</h4>
<h5 class="title">Head of Strategic Business Development</h5>
<img alt="HSBC logo" class="logo" height="29" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/hsbc-the-worlds-local-bank-2010-90x29.png" title="HSBC" width="90"/>
<p>Tony Richter joined the HSBC Group in 1979, after graduating as a Bachelor of Arts in German and Economics in England. More than 15 years of his career have been spent outside the UK in Asia and Continental Europe.</p>
<p>Following various management positions in both Corporate and Correspondent Banking, Credit and International Planning, Tony moved into Global Payments and Cash Management, Europe in 1998. His positions have included roles in project, product and sales management.</p>
<p>Current responsibilities are for strategic business development across the European Region, including the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) and Payment Services Directive (PSD) Programme.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="how-has-the-market-responded-to-sepa-so-far">How has the market responded to SEPA so far?</h5>
<p>The first thing to note – and here we’re talking about SEPA Credit Transfers – is that the 8.8% or so take-up in the market as a whole is largely due to fact that corporates and businesses are taking advantage of the cross-border play on prices. This is absolutely understandable and I guess that would be mainly around cross-border supplier payments being switched from previous ways of making those payments to the SEPA Credit Transfer.</p>
<p>The other thing that we are seeing – which is more on a domestic front, in terms of volume – is the big news around the French public sector, which is moving quite rapidly to SEPA Credit Transfer. We know that their target is to have 80% completed by the end of 2010 or the beginning of 2011. Certainly, we can verify that in terms of the through-put that we are seeing from our customers in France.</p>
<h5 id="are-there-others-following-the-french-governments-lead">Are there others following the French government’s lead?</h5>
<p>We are a large institution in France and not so large in some of the other countries. Looking at some specific countries, though, we are seeing that our customers in Belgium in particular are migrating to SEPA. This is in tandem with the national plan to have the credit transfers migrated by the end of this year. Spain and Malta are also actively migrating. Certainly, looking at our customer base, we are holding their hands through this migration and that is now well advanced.</p>
<p>Obviously the UK is a very large market for us. We have been surprised – right from when the SEPA Credit Transfer first launched – by bigger than expected demand among our retail customers there. They are taking advantage of SEPA in order to make payments relating to their European properties and other European responsibilities.</p>
<p>Finally, we are now receiving substantial numbers of RFPs across the board, largely from multinationals. These are not just European multinationals, incidentally; we are getting RFPs from US and Asian multinationals, too. These multinationals are drilling down and asking, “What is it you can do for us?” Their RFPs are covering both SEPA Credit Transfers and, where relevant, Direct Debits, too. So we are seeing a lot more activity on that front and there are some interesting insights coming from them on what corporates are looking for.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-happening-there">You mentioned SEPA Direct Debits. What is happening there?</h5>
<p>There is activity in terms of RFPs. We had not, until very recently, seen any major movement of migration by SDD creditors, ie the large utilities and telecoms companies. The reason for this is that until now not all banks have been reachable in order to debit customers’ accounts. That was only compulsory from 1<sup>st</sup> November 2010.</p>
<p>However, we are now seeing some movement, such as a major French customer which has now decided to move to the SEPA Direct Debit. This is not a customer of ours, but we will be on the receiving side of that. It is an interesting indication that despite some issues we still have around SEPA Direct Debits, there is movement in the market.</p>
<h5 id="what-benefits-have-your-customers-seen-from-sct-so-far">What benefits have your customers seen from SCT so far?</h5>
<p>In the cross-border space, price. I think, also, they are benefiting from the certainty that the SEPA Credit Transfer gives customers because it is defined in the rule books and supported by the Payment Services Directive (PSD) exactly what customers can expect and how their payments will be treated. It is that certainty and consistency of treatment across the whole region that is of benefit.</p>
<p>There are other specific benefits too. For example, in Malta the SEPA Direct Debit will represent a new direct debit market. Until now, all direct debit payments have been what they call ‘on us’ transactions – where both the debtor and the creditor have accounts in the same institution. What the SEPA Direct Debit will bring to Malta is the ability for a creditor to have his account in one institution and the debtor to have his account in another. It will open up that market completely.</p>
<p>Over and above that, other benefits our customers see from SEPA include reduced maintenance and administrative costs as they look to simplify their account structures. That should reduce their need for reconciliations and also reduce the number of queries on their accounts by virtue of the fact that there are fewer of them.</p>
<p>I think the other major area – and this is not specifically SEPA – is reducing funding costs within our customers’ treasuries. With SEPA there should also come more efficient liquidity management. A treasurer will be able to know where his balances are and be able to manoeuvre those balances within the organisation as required in a less complicated way than he has been able to up to now. In other words, optimising the use of his surplus cash. It is early days, but we are beginning to see these advantages.</p>
<p>In short, the first step is ‘let’s migrate’. Step two will be to take the benefits of rationalising structures once the initial move has been made. It really depends on the type of customer – whether he is centralised or decentralised in terms of treasury, and the size of his international operations across the region.</p>
<h5 id="what-sort-of-obstacles-do-corporates-face-when-migrating">What sort of obstacles do corporates face when migrating?</h5>
<p>As far as SEPA Credit Transfers are concerned, I’m not seeing a huge number of obstacles in terms of the product itself. I do think though that in a number of communities, we are seeing a requirement from customers for additional information, which treasurers may be getting from their legacy systems today and which is not strictly part of the SEPA rule book. So we are having to do some extra work on the ‘value added’ features that customers want to see in order for them to continue to do their business modelling, cash flow forecasting, liquidity management, even reconciliations, in-house in the same sort of way that they have done until now.</p>
<p>In terms of the direct debit, there are a couple of issues. In Germany, in particular, there is still the legal issue of whether existing mandates can be used in the SEPA environment without the need of any new customer involvement. This issue has dragged on for a while and, as far as I am aware, it has not been resolved yet. Obviously, it is very important for the German migration plans. There is nothing to stop the banks from being reachable – the question is whether the creditors will migrate and they are the ones who will need to work closely with the debtors in terms of switching the mandates across.</p>
<p>There is also an issue in France and Italy over the paper mandates, which are seen by some customers as a bit of a barrier. They would prefer a dematerialised mandate – an e-mandate or digital solution. Communities are coming together to discuss the issue. The European Payments Council (EPC) recommended such a solution and we are aware that some software houses are now actively selling software which would provide digital mandates, but I think this is something that the whole market would need to move to because it would be difficult to operate both paper and digital mandates in the same space.</p>
<p>Ideally, there would be a mass migration to the digital mandate. Some communities will want this; others will be satisfied with the paper mandates. It needs to be looked at as the SEPA Direct Debit takes hold. In fact, it is actively being discussed in France by all stakeholders in the community.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-the-significance-of-the-ecs-expected-announcement-on-the-sepa-end-date">What is the significance of the EC’s expected announcement on the SEPA end-date?</h5>
<p>We understand that the announcement has recently been delayed, but it is a highly significant event and we are keen to see the announcement. It’s a substantial piece of legislation and needs to be right because it is a major step. It will provide focus to all stakeholders as they move from their legacy into a new euro payments environment. The draft is expected to give a deadline for SEPA Credit Transfers 12 months after the regulation comes into force, whereas for direct debits it will be 24 months. The key question then; is how long the regulation will take before it is approved in the European parliament?</p>
<p>I think the banks have a very significant role to play in helping corporates through the migration period. We have been in ‘build’ mode for some time and we have had our sales force and others out talking to customers and generally trying to spread the message about SEPA. We see that activity will be increasing quite significantly once the announcement is made.</p>
<h5 id="what-advice-are-you-giving-clients-in-light-of-the-impending-announcement">What advice are you giving clients in light of the impending announcement?</h5>
<p>It depends on the type of customer we’re talking to, but generally what we are saying is that by now we hope that most of our customers are in a position – if they are internationally active – to really know how many customers and suppliers they have across the region and to know how many euro bank accounts and bank relationships they have – and then to be gathering statistics on the volumes of payments and collections that could become SEPA.</p>
<p>There is also work to do internally around automation of processes, looking at liquidity structures if they have them in place already or if there is an opportunity to introduce them. The big factor really is the degree of treasury centralisation that may or may not have already taken place and if there is a cultural desire to move in that direction because SEPA would lend itself to a more centralised treasury function.</p>
<p>In a nutshell – they should analyse payments traffic; look at the formatting of their SEPA payments now to make sure they have the BIC and IBAN in their database now for their business partners; and consider the systems’ analysis and the degree to which they wish to centralise their treasuries.</p>
<p>At the same time, with this EC draft regulation expected at any time, treasurers need to keep an eye on the outside world to see when that regulation comes out and what it contains.</p>
<h5 id="do-you-believe-the-european-commission-will-release-a-psd-mark-ii-to-iron-out-the-problems-with-the-original-directive">Do you believe the European Commission will release a PSD Mark II to iron-out the problems with the original directive?</h5>
<p>We know that there will be a review in 2012 and I guess it depends on what comes out of that review. A couple of things that we are seeing in the market – and I think this is reasonably common in the banking fraternity – is that not all banks are as yet fully applying, as we see it, the interpretation of the PSD in terms of the ‘full amount’ principle and the value dating on payments, insofar as a customer’s account being credited the same day as the funds are being received. We don’t see that yet universally being applied right across the board, so that is something that will need to happen in the next 12 months or so, leading up to the review in 2012. I think it is just the banking community getting used to the way of doing business here.</p>
<p>One other area where we have had feedback from our customers is in the charging convention of ‘SHA’, which to our understanding is very clearly interpreted in the PSD as being the only charging option available. Some of our customers – in particular where salary payments and pension related payments are involved – actually preferred the ‘OUR’ option, so that they could be sure that the person receiving the salary or the pension would get 100% of the payment as it came through. Their bankers – as a beneficiary bank – would not take a commission from that. Obviously, under a ‘SHA’ arrangement the beneficiary bank has that right, provided they agree the amount of that commission with their customer beforehand.</p>
<h5 id="and-your-final-thoughts-on-the-future-of-sepa">And your final thoughts on the future of SEPA?</h5>
<p>A lot is happening in the market and there are still a lot of open questions, and these are ones we are grappling with. At the same time, as an institution, we are trying to put to bed our investment plans for next year, which are more or less there now. It really is a case of careful management and being very alert to developments in the market to make sure that we are investing in the right things at the right time.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Operating in China can be extremely challenging for foreign banks, in particular when corporate clients are based in remote locations.  We speak to Leo Yin about BNP Paribas’ effective multi-bank solution that allows the bank far greater reach across China and enables its clients to achieve visibility across their accounts.  We also discuss the rise of the direct debit in China, as well as e-receipt account reconciliation.</p>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Leo Yin</h4>
<h5 class="title">Head of Sales, Cash Management China, Global Transaction Banking</h5>
<img alt="BNP Paribas" class="logo org" height="26" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/bnp-paribas-logo-2012-120x26.png" width="120"/>
<p>Leo Yin is Head of Sales, Cash Management of Global Transaction Banking at BNP Paribas (China) Limited with the responsibility to promote BNP Paribas cash management capabilities in China to corporate clients including multinationals and local Chinese corporates. Prior to joining BNP Paribas, Leo had various leading roles in sales and/or product management in international/local financial institutions including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Standard Chartered, HSBC and China Construction Bank.</p>
<p>Leo has over 19 years’ banking experience with a masters degree from Peking University. Leo has one child and is from Beijing.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="how-do-you-offer-your-clients-accessibility-to-bank-account-services-across-china">How do you offer your clients accessibility to bank account services across China and how does this approach differ from your peers?</h5>
<p>In China, the common challenge for multinational corporates is to gain better visibility and control over their accounts across different banks. Cash management providers, especially the international players, are putting tremendous efforts into positioning themselves as the overlay bank through improving accessibility and consolidating multiple banking channels. In this regard, BNP Paribas introduced its unique multi-bank solution (MBS) about two years ago. In essence, MBS congregates multiple banking channels into one single platform, allowing our clients to gain global visibility and full control of their accounts across different banks. Through MBS, our client can query directly its account information, manage the initiation and the authorisation of payment and concentrate its liquidity across multiple banking accounts with ease.</p>
<p>The difference from the market offering lies in the flexibility and scalability of MBS as well as the level of standardisation in account reporting and payment handling for all accounts across different banks, which in turn significantly help to improve client’s account reconciliation and even cash forecasting.</p>
<h5 id="how-does-the-mbs-help-corporates-manage-their-risks-better">How does the MBS help corporates manage their risks better?</h5>
<p>The basis of good cash management is to know where your cash lies. MBS gives corporates a complete view of their accounts across different banks, thus forming the fundamental foundation of good cash management. Through a single platform, clients maintain the same set of rules and enforce the management and control of accounts payable. Global visibility and centralised control also allow clients to respond rapidly to a liquidity need, thus improving treasury management.</p>
<p>From a technology perspective, BNP Paribas is fully responsible for the implementation, and continue to take care of the connectivity after implementation.</p>
<h5 id="could-you-explain-a-little-more-how-the-mbs-improves-visibility-over-the-clients-cash">Could you explain a little more how the MBS improves visibility over the client’s cash?</h5>
<p>From a multi-bank standpoint, all of the client’s account information will be routed through MBS, which is in turn delivered and displayed into Connexis, our web-based portal for the same ‘look and feel’. Traditional multi-bank channels offer MT940 and MT942 for which information timeliness depends on the frequency of MT942 updates. MBS retrieves information when available, making account reporting near to a real-time basis. Besides Connexis, MBS also offers data import/export and host-to-host connectivity, allowing the direct and seamless exchange of account information between corporate treasury system and MBS platform.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, MBS improves timeliness of information, standardises the reporting format of accounts across different banks, allows data to be downloaded for further processing and provides for host-to-host connectivity. Overall, it is a perfect solution for the corporate to improve visibility of its cash and cash forecasting.</p>
<h5 id="how-does-the-mbs-allow-corporates-to-take-control-of-their-accounts">How does the MBS allow corporates to take control of their accounts?</h5>
<p>MBS provides a single platform for account management. The user profile, data rights and authorisation matrix can be centrally managed and controlled, thus reducing the risk associated with handling multiple banking channels. With a global visibility of accounts across different banks, the corporate has clear and updated account information on hand and can mobilise its liquidity rapidly.</p>
<p>MBS supports Chinese language, which is essential in China. Foreign MNC’s treasury systems are in Roman characters. MBS allows the dual existence of Chinese characters and Roman characters. This answers the need of MNC to maintain its global system while accommodating the need of Chinese language in China.</p>
<h5 id="how-popular-is-the-direct-debit-dd-system-in-the-country">Aside from the MBS, BNP Paribas has also been investing time in its direct debit capabilities. How popular is the direct debit (DD) system in the country? Also, what are the regulatory restrictions surrounding direct debits?</h5>
<p>In recent years, direct debit has increasingly become popular with corporates endeavouring to collect automatically and promptly. The advent of electronic direct debits has made a big difference. This has prompted a move from paper to electronic transactions and all major cities are now in the process of migration. In my opinion, the commercialisation of the direct debit in China makes sense for the whole business society now.</p>
<p>However, there are constraints. For example, foreign banks are not yet allowed to operate direct debits for tax payments. The rules and regulations are different across China. In Beijing, it seems that banks have to stick to the existing paper-based direct debit payments and there are no clear guidelines on electronic direct debit. These are real challenges for banks and their clients. We are endeavouring to organise meetings with the regulators to obtain clear guidance.</p>
<h5 id="how-can-you-help-corporates-to-adopt-direct-debit-in-china">How can you help corporates to adopt direct debit in China?</h5>
<p>As a direct member of CNAPS, we are fully equipped with direct debit collection and payment functions. We have also engaged regulators in continuous dialogues to better advise our clients on the adoption and implementation of direct debit in China. Coupling our capabilities and know-how, we can help corporate clients such as those in leasing and insurance businesses to set up an electronic direct debit collection regime according to their needs.</p>
<h5 id="can-you-explain-how-bnp-paribas-e-receipt-account-reconciliation-works">Can you explain how BNP Paribas’ e-receipt account reconciliation works?</h5>
<p>Account reconciliation is becoming more and more important for most corporate clients. Improving your reconciliation depends on how comprehensive the information that you get from your payer’s bank is. In China, there are no standard practices that dictate that the payer’s bank must include all the information you have put in your payment instructions to execute the payment. Sometimes the information is truncated – either manually or through a system.</p>
<p>Indeed, the majority of corporates find that their collections information is not sufficient for them to reconcile efficiently. A number of international banks are looking at this, and we now have the solution – e-receipt account reconciliation.</p>
<p>In China, regulation stipulates that the payer’s bank must input the payer’s account number and pass it through the clearing system. We virtualise the account number to make it contain other data. We discuss with the client to determine the additional information they need to perform efficient reconciliation, for instance, vendor code plus invoice number or even contract number. Once the necessary information is determined, it will be pre-designed as part of the account number which can be shown in the payment instruction. This information cannot be truncated via clearing.</p>
<p>In turn upon receiving the incoming collection, related data will be then converted into the original information pre-designed for the client, thus helping to make reconciliation easier.</p>
<p>To capitalise on the advances we have made in this area, however, we have also been running education sessions with our clients to enable them to use the e-receipt account reconciliation system – to explain how they can manage their vendor codes and payment codes, for example.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Exploring new ways to interact with clients whilst maintaining high standards and functionality is a significant challenge for today’s transaction banks. We speak to Michael Spiegel, Head of Trade Finance and Cash Management Corporates, EMEA, Global Transaction Banking at Deutsche Bank about the evolution of client dialogue, new technologies and how they are shaping the industry. We also discuss Deutsche Bank’s growth in EMEA, in particular in the Netherlands.</p>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Michael Spiegel</h4>
<h5 class="title">Head of Trade Finance and Cash Management Corporates</h5>
<img alt="Deutsche Bank logo" class="logo" height="38" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/deutsche-bank-logo-2010-120x38.png" title="Deutsche Bank" width="120"/>
<p>Michael Spiegel is the head of Trade Finance and Cash Management Corporates for Europe (ex Germany), the Middle East and Africa in Deutsche Bank’s Global Transaction Banking division. Michael is based in London.</p>
<p>Prior to this, Michael was Head of Trade Finance and Cash Management Corporates, Americas, a position he held since 2005. Michael began his career in Deutsche Bank’s Credit Risk Management Group in 1987 and has held a variety of positions with the bank in locations including Hong Kong.</p>
<p>In 2005, he was named one of the 100 Most Influential People in Finance by Treasury &amp; Risk Management magazine. Michael holds a BA in Banking from the Bank Academy in Frankfurt, Germany.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="how-important-is-client-interaction-in-todays-transaction-banking-environment">How important is client interaction in today’s transaction banking environment?</h5>
<p>Client interaction really is fundamental to any successful transaction banking relationship. Through mutual dialogue, banks can advise clients in finding the best way forward for their business, as well as assisting the client to implement best practice solutions. Similarly, through this interaction, clients can help banks to shape their business offering and also provide ideas for product innovation. Essentially, what this means is that the client is actually contributing to the way in which their transaction bank is designed.</p>
<h5 id="in-what-ways-has-deutsche-bank-embraced-this-client-centric-approach">In what ways has Deutsche Bank embraced this client-centric approach?</h5>
<p>We are actively engaged in changing our bank to include this level of client interaction, rather than simply offering clients the services that we, as bankers, think that they need. Aside from regular, direct discussions with our clients, we also have a Client Advisory Board, which has been running for over a decade. At the sessions we run, a number of our clients meet with senior management to share views on trends and discuss future requirements. It is a very open forum and helps us tremendously in finding out how we can better serve our clients.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on our open approach and count strong client relationships and excellent customer service among Deutsche Bank’s core strengths. In fact, we regularly have very positive feedback on our decentralised customer service model. Using this in-country structure, means that we are close to the corporate entity in each country, and this close proximity allows us to be in contact with our clients, know how they operate and provide a very customised and a user-friendly service on the back of that local knowledge. This is a pillar of our strategy.</p>
<h5 id="how-have-they-shaped-product-development">What are the main themes coming out of these client discussions and how have they shaped product development?</h5>
<p>Post-crisis, clients are looking to grow revenues, whilst keeping a tight rein on budgets. In itself, this is a significant task, but coupled with heightened risk management concerns that threaten supply chain stability, treasurers are operating in extremely challenging circumstances. As such, clients are looking to identify areas where they can glean further internal cost savings, without having a detrimental impact on future growth.</p>
<p>Greater control over areas such as high-volume, low-value cross-currency payments can provide these sought after cost savings. Many large multinationals for instance operate using a ‘threshold’ system for payments, and amounts over and above the threshold are dealt with by the treasury department as ‘trade’ payments. However, anything below this threshold is often processed by overseas finance departments or operational teams. As such, visibility and control are lost and there is no central record of the FX rate that is applied to these low-value transactions.</p>
<p>With this client feedback in mind, Deutsche Bank developed a new cross-currency payment solution called FX4Cash, which was launched in July 2008, with the aim of streamlining and automating payables for clients, affording them greater visibility and control. The solution supports payments in over 125 different currencies, with multiple payment options and access channels, together with competitive rates. Rather than providing the client with information on the FX rate post-payment, FX4Cash allows them to see the rates as they are being applied. Moreover, the solution is highly automated, which leads to greater efficiency, speed and accuracy, together with fewer exceptions and lower fees.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, our continued investment into bringing cash management and trade activities together means that we are now much more focused on the receivables side of treasury processes. As a result of the tight credit conditions that the market is experiencing today, many treasurers are now realising that it’s not enough only to look into the payables side of operations, they must also take a closer look into the receivables side in order to generate internal cash. Many of our large corporate clients have already addressed their payables concerns through payment factories and shared service centres, but it is now time to look towards collection factory solutions. To help clients we need to set-up accurate information flows. This then enables the client to perform automated reconciliation matching, which brings with it the efficiency benefit of straight through processing.</p>
<p>Again, with a strong focus around receivables management, we are also continuing to invest in mobile services and card offerings. Commercial cards is definitely an area that we see ourselves becoming a much stronger player in going forward.</p>
<h5 id="so-the-developments-have-been-largely-focused-on-the-broader-themes-surrounding-payables-and-receivables">So the developments have been largely focused on the broader themes surrounding payables and receivables?</h5>
<p>Deutsche Bank is focused on delivering solutions that respond to clients’ specific needs and on improving the overall client experience. One example of us responding to a particular client need is our investment into the development of ‘virtual accounts’. These allow clients such as insurance companies, investment managers and some large corporates to segregate funds without opening a myriad of independent accounts.</p>
<p>Account opening is another one of those broader themes that we are also looking to address in line with suggestions from our clients. The bank’s role here is to make it as easy as possible for the client to actually come onboard by standardising documentation and automating processes. Deutsche Bank has developed a centralised administrative database, which will enable us to offer a much quicker technical turnaround, and also removes some of the need for implementation staff to contact the technical support centre for non-standard onboarding administrations. This provides us with a greater flexibility in the handling of multiple changes for individual customers. In addition, we’ve started to use intelligent Adobe forms, which I believe is unique in our space.</p>
<p>With these ‘intelligent’ forms in place, the client is guided through the process and their data is instantly validated. This means that the client onboarding process can begin straight away, whilst avoiding the manual re-keying of data, improving data quality and speeding up all of the internal processing. Not only have we therefore introduced a much more efficient work practice within the bank, but we have also significantly improved the client experience. But we will not stop there; we will strive to make ongoing improvements to this process, making it even simpler where possible.</p>
<h5 id="how-has-this-changed-over-the-last-decade">To what extent is technology the key to enhancing client experience and how has this changed over the last decade?</h5>
<p>What we have seen over the past five or so years is that clients increasingly expect more user-friendly technology. The bar for client experience has traditionally been set by the retail banking sector and transaction banks need to ensure that they are delivering both ease-of-use and ease-of-integration as they roll out their new technology offerings.</p>
<p>Corporate treasurers are increasingly looking to their banking partners to provide integrated online tools that facilitate a much more holistic approach to liquidity and risk management. Close monitoring of cash positions and exposures has become of utmost importance to the treasurer and availability of real-time information is imperative. In response to demand from clients, and in order to benefit from the synergies available through an integrated approach to treasury and liquidity management, Deutsche Bank’s Global Transaction Banking and Global Markets divisions have come together to deliver an integrated liquidity management module on the bank’s existing e-commerce platform, Autobahn.</p>
<h5 id="what-you-see-as-the-main-benefits-that-corporates-can-derive-from-using-it">Could you explain how this liquidity management offering works and what you see as the main benefits that corporates can derive from using it?</h5>
<p>This is a state-of-the-art web-based liquidity management module that allows corporate and financial institution clients to access the full range of Deutsche Bank’s treasury and liquidity services through a single sign-on application. The platform therefore combines liquidity management, forecasting and planning, foreign exchange and investment services, in a single location. In addition, clients can access strategic and tactical financing tools as well as information and analysis tools through the dashboard on the platform. For corporates, this means the ability to better determine liquidity positions, foreign exchange exposures and investment opportunities at a glance.</p>
<p>Real-time account information can be gathered on a multi-bank basis, which also means that corporates can more effectively monitor their credit line utilisation. Of course, clients can also invest liquidity through the platform, with a selection of money market funds and short-term investment options on offer. Additionally, Deutsche Bank offers value added post-execution services such as automated matching and reconciliation tools.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we are aiming to deliver a solution which reduces the complexity of our clients’ daily treasury activities, whilst offering full functionality in a user-friendly environment.</p>
<h5 id="why-have-bank-portals-suddenly-come-under-the-spotlight">Why have bank portals suddenly come under the spotlight?</h5>
<p>Generally speaking, the treasury world now has a much greater interest in enterprise risk management, so that tools that offer visibility, such as portals, have become of far greater importance post-crisis. Beyond visibility, portals also offer the ability to further combine cash and trade activities, with supply chain finance solutions and e-billing capabilities.</p>
<p>Our main aim with developing the Deutsche Bank e-commerce platform further is to allow the transaction banking products to evolve alongside the investment banking, sales and trading products, and to enable clients to access a strategic financial tool through a single window. We strongly believe that portals should be easily customisable, so that clients have their own user permissions and can change the way they view the information, rather than being stuck with the functionality that a bank believes a user should be able to see on screen.</p>
<h5 id="what-other-technologies-are-you-consequently-investigating">So clients are becoming much more demanding in terms of the technology they want to see on offer. What other technologies are you consequently investigating?</h5>
<p>In order to better serve our clients, it is always necessary to embrace new technologies and mindsets. We are currently exploring ways to leverage the power of social media within the treasury space and are planning a campaign using social media technology. In fact, we have recently hired a Head of User Experience into our Client Access product team – who used to work for one of the leading search engines – to build up that side of our offering. It will be a huge undertaking to ensure that the social media side of our offering is maintained properly and monitored appropriately.</p>
<p>The great thing about social media is that it not only helps us to tap the knowledge-base of our customers, but it allows the client to be very open with us. We want our clients to feel empowered to bring suggestions to us and have a say in driving the direction of the services they receive.</p>
<h5 id="will-deutsche-bank-be-taking-these-innovations-into-new-markets">Will Deutsche Bank be taking these innovations into new markets?</h5>
<p>We offer our new products and services in all locations where they are relevant and beneficial to clients. For instance, over time our innovations will be available in countries where we have recently expanded our EMEA presence. We have recently widened our local coverage in the Netherlands and opened new offices in Ukraine and Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, Deutsche Bank has acquired approximately 20% of what was ABN Amro’s corporate banking business in The Netherlands, comprising a nationwide network of 13 SME branches, two mid-cap business branches as well as a domestic factoring company. Together with the business that we already had in Amsterdam, we have become the fourth largest corporate bank in the country and the Netherlands has become like a second home market for us. We are excited about the possibilities to expand our product and serve offering in this market and to reach out to new clients.</p>
<h5 id="how-will-you-rise-to-the-top">Is there a great deal of competition in that market? If so, how will you rise to the top?</h5>
<p>I believe that we are very well positioned amongst the Dutch corporate bank competitors, as Deutsche Bank can offer local clients a truly international network. In terms of the technology we can offer, as well as the product range, I would like to think that we can bring much deeper and broader expertise into the mid-cap space. Whether it is a question of risk management tools, financing the supply chain, or capital market discussions, Deutsche Bank is well positioned to broaden the discussion away from a pure bilateral or bank lending driven model into a much more alternative funding model. This will help to prepare the broader market for any future uncertainty.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we want to bring easily usable risk management tools and some more sophisticated products into the SME segment in the country. Of course, this will mean working with our clients on the suitability side, so that we can deliver the right solution to the right client, we are not a bank that blindly pushes products. We want to be the leading bank to the corporate universe in the Netherlands, in particular to those companies that have international needs.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Multi-bank solutions, eBAM, SWIFT for Corporates and SEPA Direct Debit: much is happening in the cash management market, with some exciting opportunities for treasurers to optimise efficiency, visibility and control. This month we speak to Alex Caviezel, Managing Director – EMEA Regional Executive Treasury Services, about trends and developments in the cash management market, the evolving needs of corporate clients and J.P. Morgan’s global investments.</p>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Alex Caviezel</h4>
<h5 class="title">Head of Treasury Services EMEA</h5>
<img alt="J.P. Morgan logo" class="logo" height="20" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/jpmorgan-logo-2012-100x20.png" title="J.P. Morgan" width="100"/>
<p>Alex Caviezel is J.P. Morgan’s Head of Treasury Services EMEA. Caviezel’s EMEA management committee includes Treasury Services’ regional sales, product, client service, implementation, operation, technology and functional partner team executives.</p>
<p>Caviezel began his career with The Chase Manhattan Bank, AG in Germany in 1983 as an internal auditor; he then moved into a corporate finance function with Chase in Zurich. Thereafter, Caviezel moved to the bank’s Geneva branch, taking over structured trade finance, and then to the position of General Manager of Chase’s Swiss branch entities.</p>
<p>He subsequently held the position of Business Manager for Treasury Services in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, prior to taking up dual regional roles in Trade and Global Product Management. Caviezel was named Head of the Treasury Services business in Asia Pacific in 2003 where he was responsible for the business throughout the region including sales, product management, client service, technology and operations etc.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-developments-have-you-seen-in-the-cash-management-market-in-the-last-twelve-months">What developments have you seen in the cash management market in the last twelve months?</h5>
<p>The cash management business remains strong, demonstrating resilient and reliable returns throughout the financial crisis. While there are relatively high barriers to entry, some revenue streams have been impacted by new regulation. And as a consequence, financial institutions are considering their prospects in the cash management market carefully. Certainly, as a truly global provider of cash management services, we find ourselves amongst a small group of banks whose firm-wide policy is to keep investing through the cycle.</p>
<p>The barriers to entry are associated with keeping technology up to date with the demands of today’s regional or global treasury. System interoperability is becoming a requirement as corporates look to banks to help simplify the complex technological environment in which treasury operates.</p>
<h5 id="how-is-jp-morgan-responding-to-this">How are corporate clients’ requirements changing and how is J.P. Morgan responding to this?</h5>
<p>Clients are becoming increasingly exacting about what they want and how products should be designed to accommodate their activities, policies and processes.  At J.P. Morgan, we have developed a concept called co-invention, whereby we develop products in unison with clients – they are involved throughout the design process, allowing them to outline their future requirements.</p>
<p>We tend to approach clients from different industry segments, including non-bank financial institutions like hedge funds and brokers/dealers. Clients are often willing to share their experiences to help us shape the service proposition. It requires a certain amount of investment on the client’s part as well, but ultimately, they know that the end product will provide the features and functionality that they require.</p>
<p>Clients are now looking at multi-bank solutions which act as a practical alternative to the abundance of proprietary channels that are now widely available. As factors such as the internet accelerate corporate expansion, J.P. Morgan has invested heavily in new global platforms and a client service model which, combined, enable a consistent client experience and service excellence, worldwide.</p>
<p>Service is undoubtedly a key selection criterion for corporates in search of a global cash management provider and something J.P. Morgan is well regarded for.</p>
<p>How has J.P. Morgan singled itself out through its investments throughout the financial downturn and what are the benefits of these investments for corporate treasurers?</p>
<p>First of all I would highlight our geographic expansion, which will allow us to serve clients in those territories where they are currently active or are planning to expand into. In EMEA, countries such as Russia, Saudi Arabia and the whole of sub-Saharan Africa are becoming increasingly important within the operating model of our clients.</p>
<p>We are building out more integrated local capabilities at a time when we know that some of our competitors are actively retreating from some of these countries.</p>
<p>Other global initiatives worth mentioning are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A new accounting platform, that has helped us improve the global client experience with regards to reporting, billing, and account postings. This powerful, single platform also gives us greater agility to bring product developments and modifications to market quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new payment platform providing a single, very robust foundation for all our low-value or ACH payments, including our entire SEPA service proposition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new liquidity platform, supporting the firm’s entire liquidity management product portfolio. We have introduced a new user interface, which enhances the treasurer’s visibility and control over their own liquidity structures.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this is aimed at those fundamental concerns that treasurers have around visibility of cash and control over risk. They want to know which counterparties they’re exposed to, and understand the nature of the risks involved. Is the process of aggregating, administering and investing funds efficient? Are they able to apply risk management controls globally? These are the concerns that our new solutions will address.</p>
<h5 id="which-of-these-initiatives-are-of-interest-to-corporate-treasurers">The world of banking seems awash with regulation and new market initiatives – which of these initiatives are of interest to corporate treasurers?</h5>
<p>We could have a very lengthy debate about this but there are several regulations out there specifically targeting banks, which will surely have an indirect impact on corporates. For example, the new liquidity regime, Basel III, the Payment Services Directive (PSD): these are already in place, or in the pipeline.</p>
<p>Inevitably, whether we like it or not, implementing many of these regulations will result in an increase in capital requirements. Therefore there will be a cost to financial institutions, which will trickle down to the users of cash management services.</p>
<p>Of course we are all going to try our hardest to manage these new costs but this will need to be funded. Some banks are already suffering from reduced payment revenues due to the PSD, and one would expect banks to make up this shortfall somewhere else. Reduced income streams in a high-investment environment will prompt financial institutions to ask whether cash management should really be one of their core activities.</p>
<p>There are also new regulations coming into force in 2010 which will ensure that all Eurozone banks are able to process core SEPA Direct Debits. This will make the SEPA Direct Debit effective for automated and standardised collections in 16 European countries, whichever the counterparty banks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at an industry level we will continue to support the adoption of common standards for eBAM and the continued migration from paper payments instruments to electronic, and we will continue to work with SWIFT to achieve this.</p>
<h5 id="what-trends-have-you-identified-in-corporate-cash-and-liquidity-management-over-the-last-twelve-months">What trends have you identified in corporate cash and liquidity management over the last twelve months?</h5>
<p>There are a number of trends I would like to highlight:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We’re seeing greater interest in the control of investment counterparty risk. This is the foundation of one of our money market investment products, which give clients more control over counterparty selection, and yet automates the execution to optimise efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clients are pushing for solutions which offer greater interoperability as more and more technology permeates treasury. Our host to host channel offering is able to adapt to a corporate’s file format preferences, minimising re-calibration efforts client-side. Statement and payment reconfiguration is part of what we consider to be our value-add, not something that clients should really have to concern themselves with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SWIFT for corporates demonstrates how corporates are pushing for bank-agnostic channels, and we’re pleased to see SWIFT making its services more widely available. We’re aware that the proliferation of proprietary services makes cash management more complex, which is why we develop multi-bank capability for our channels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Corporates are feeling a little uncomfortable about the prospect of further market consolidation, from a concentration risk viewpoint at least. And so they are considering how to spread their cash management activities more broadly across more counterparties. I think we benefit from that, given our relative strength in the market. Clients are really focusing on which banks have core competency in this area, and which ones are developing their core competencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treasurers are becoming more involved in areas which have traditionally been covered exclusively by procurement, such as corporate card and supplier finance programmes and also working capital initiatives. Today, as treasurers and chief financial officers are looking into the efficient cash utilisation, working capital management practices have become a specialised discipline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Centralisation of treasury remains an ongoing theme, with the largest and most geographically dispersed corporates now looking to optimise levels of visibility, control and cash management efficiency at group level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Market failures have driven corporates to seek greater control over counterparty risk and so we’ve seen heightened interest in the control of FX settlement risk. Interest in CLS is evident, not only from financial institutions, but also from larger corporates.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="what-developments-do-you-expect-to-see-in-the-cash-management-market-in-the-next-twelve-months">What developments do you expect to see in the cash management market in the next twelve months?</h5>
<p>I think smaller suppliers will be granted the opportunity to leverage the credit power of large buyers to achieve more favourable terms than they would otherwise achieve by going direct through their main bank. This is all about supply chain finance, where suppliers to large buyers are able to leverage new financing products, enabling them to monetise receivables earlier.</p>
<p>With regards to high volume collections, which is traditionally a challenging task, we’re recommending that clients leverage the SEPA Direct Debit. This standardised, cost-effective solution helps clients launch into new markets with speed and agility. This, coupled with online reconciliation tools such as Receivables Edge (which we continue to develop for the global market), makes a really compelling proposition around collections.</p>
<p>I expect continued growth amongst the BRIC countries, but the operating environments in those territories present treasury with challenges. One such challenge is how to leverage locally domiciled balances where repatriation of funds is not possible. We have developed interest optimisation solutions in Asia for liquidity managers seeking to optimise the value of balances across the region.</p>
<p>Interoperability is a key watchword for us at J.P. Morgan as we are determined to simplify the corporate treasurer’s interaction with bank infrastructure, and multi-bank services are an example of this.</p>
<p>We have already talked about eBAM – the elimination of manual processes behind bank account management. We expect to begin our pilot later this year and I am quite sure that eBAM’s ability to streamline manual processes will help solutions of this type to gain momentum rapidly.</p>
<p>Corporates have started to question whether they should build in-house, or buy in, dedicated treasury management systems, which can involve long and complex implementations. What we’re seeing now is corporate treasurers considering whether some of the increasingly sophisticated bank systems, like J.P. Morgan’s, will meet their requirements more simply.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>This month we talk to Laurie Carroll, Global Short Duration Strategist at BNY Mellon, about why corporate treasurers should adopt a segregated approach to managing cash. We explore BNY Mellon’s three tier cash management strategy, the benefits this can bring to corporates and future developments expected in the industry.</p>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Laurie Carroll</h4>
<h5 class="title">Global Short Duration Strategist</h5>
<img alt="BNY Mellon Asset Management logo" class="logo" height="53" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/bny-mellon-asset-management-logo-90x53.png" title="BNY Mellon Asset Management" width="90"/>

</div>
<h5 id="how-have-recent-market-events-affected-the-way-corporate-treasurers-approach-cash-management">How have recent market events affected the way corporate treasurers approach cash management?</h5>
<p>Above all, recent events have led corporate treasurers to focus on the amount of cash they have on hand and how they are managing it – either internally or via investment managers. Treasurers are taking a closer look at what they are doing and how they are placing that cash. There simply isn’t enough yield available at the moment and people are not making a lot on their cash, but I do not believe that the desire for yield has gone away.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-the-function-of-each-tier">BNY Mellon Asset Management offers a three-tier strategy for cash management – what is the function of each tier?</h5>
<p>We believe that everyone has excess cash, although they might not think that they have a lot. Most of the time this is cash that is waiting for some other reason, such as M and A activity, benefit payments, grants and longer liabilities.</p>
<p>Our strategy is to provide solutions appropriate to the three different tiers of cash typically held by clients:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first tier consists of operating cash which is required for daily cash flows. This needs to be highly liquid and money market funds or short-term separately managed accounts are the most appropriate means of providing this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second tier is the company’s core cash. This is allocated to particular medium and long-term requirements and therefore needs moderate liquidity. We believe that treasurers may be missing an opportunity to pick up additional yield here. We suggest using Enhanced Cash or Ultra Short separately managed accounts for the second tier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third tier is set aside for longer-term liabilities (such as construction costs or capital calls) and therefore less liquidity is needed and higher yields and returns are expected. We provide this with 1-3 or 1-5 year maturity portfolios or matched funding separate accounts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is really a solid framework for managing all available cash. As part of this approach, we look at how we manage fixed income at the very front end of the curve. Obviously, our cash management strategy is devoted to this specific area, in contrast to longer-term bond managers like our sister firm, Standish. So we look at the front end of the fixed income curve, meaning five years and under, and make certain determinations: how much should we keep liquid? How much should we have in the one-year area, or the three-year area? We do that every day and we think it is also useful for the client to look at their portfolio – meaning their total cash portfolio – in this way.</p>
<h5 id="so-clients-can-pick-and-choose-from-the-solutions-available">So clients can pick and choose from the solutions available?</h5>
<p>Absolutely, it depends on their needs.</p>
<p>We have, for example, been hired by institutions that have a particular liability stream up to five years and want to match that, and don’t want to worry about whether they’ll have the cash when the payment is due.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we have clients that have decided, “We have capital calls that are one year, two years etc – let’s buy high quality corporate bonds to mature in those time frames.” So we can provide clients with all three solutions – or with one or two of them.</p>
<h5 id="is-this-an-established-approach-or-something-new">Is this an established approach or something new?</h5>
<p>We have been managing this type of framework since the early 1980s in the US and we’re continuing to expand it. While we haven’t always described it in these terms – managing cash in three tiers – we have had clients for years that have hired us for one or two of the strategies I’ve mentioned, or for all of them.</p>
<h5 id="what-advantages-does-segmenting-cash-in-this-way-offer-to-corporate-clients">What advantages does segmenting cash in this way offer to corporate clients?</h5>
<p>It enhances diversification, which is increasingly important. There is diversification in the money market funds, where you see repurchase agreements, deposits and commercial paper. Once you get past the one-year area, then you are looking at corporate securities, or maybe longer-term, high-quality asset-backed securities. So it gives you diversification of instruments.</p>
<p>It also gives you some diversification away from the regulated money market area, which is only becoming more regulated. There is increasingly a spread differential between money market funds and one or two-year types of funds or instruments or portfolios, because money market funds are required by regulatory statute to keep more liquidity. They need to have an average maturity of 60 days or less to be an AAA-rated fund.</p>
<p>What regulators are saying to the banks – and of course this is a completely different set of regulators – is that the banks are going to issue longer paper, reduce their dependence on deposits and issue one-year, two-year, three-year, five-year, ten-year fixed income paper bonds. Consequently we won’t have this tremendous rollover that currently has to be done on a daily basis, or a monthly basis.</p>
<p>There will therefore be less supply in the money market area and more supply in the longer-term instruments. Again, clients can benefit from this by looking at these tiers and making a conscious decision to keep a certain amount very short and then taking other cash longer.</p>
<h5 id="how-does-this-approach-fit-in-with-the-need-to-balance-liquidity-with-yield">How does this approach fit in with the need to balance liquidity with yield?</h5>
<p>Money market funds are designed for a purpose and that is to provide liquidity. However, individual treasurers often have too much short dated cash on hand. This will of course dampen any opportunity for yield in the total cash portfolio compared to the approach we suggest, where the portions of the portfolio that are not immediately needed is invested according to the necessary profile of each bucket.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you’re going to use this framework, you should maintain investment grade only, because quality also brings you liquidity. If you need to sell corporate bonds it will be much easier if they are investment grade, as opposed to emerging market bonds or something where we literally have to go around looking for a buyer.</p>
<h5 id="why-should-treasurers-consider-outsourcing-the-investment-of-their-cash">Why should treasurers consider outsourcing the investment of their cash?</h5>
<p>There are a couple of reasons. First of all, it has become a more complex environment, as I mentioned. The regulatory changes are themselves making it a very complex environment.</p>
<p>A second reason is a lack of resources. Very large multinational corporations might have the staff to deal with this internally, but others do not. It just depends on where institutions want to spend their resources. We have a lot of staff devoted to credit research and I don’t think you see that type of credit research within a treasurer’s realm.</p>
<p>Maybe they are relying on ratings. Although we do start with ratings, we then do a much deeper dive: we have dedicated analysts conducting primary research. Can you do that kind of research if you’re a corporate treasurer? We think it’s difficult.</p>
<p>We also think it’s difficult to have the asset management software which is needed to maintain positions and track your exposures in real time. Again, some larger corporations will have that and a lot of other corporations will not.</p>
<p>We find that very large corporations that have a lot of cash – and I do mean a lot – will manage a portion of their money themselves. They’ll use money market funds; maybe they’ll have a portfolio manager internally. However, they will also hire an external manager, because that external manager gives them a different viewpoint on the world – on what the central banks are doing, what is happening with corporate credit. It gives them another avenue for information.</p>
<h5 id="are-companies-other-than-the-largest-corporations-capable-of-doing-this-in-house">Are companies other than the largest corporations capable of doing this in-house?</h5>
<p>I think it’s difficult. I think they say that they do it in-house, but what they are actually doing is holding deposits with banks. We think that’s good in some circumstances, but it’s not good for the full interest rate cycle. I think at times they feel that it is a costeffective approach, but I think that over a full interest rate cycle they lose out on some of the expertise and expose themselves to unnecessary opportunity costs.</p>
<h5 id="what-sort-of-developments-are-you-expecting-to-see-over-the-next-couple-of-years">What sort of developments are you expecting to see over the next couple of years?</h5>
<p>I think that we’ll continue to see the stable NAV money funds. I think you will see more floating rate funds in the very short space as well, and this is something we will be looking to develop.</p>
<p>Due to the supply considerations, yields are going to be low for a long time, even when central banks start to increase rates. There is just a lot less commercial paper available for participants to buy. This is where the three tier system can really add value. As mentioned earlier, by mapping your liquidity requirements onto your investments you can achieve additional yield in your portfolio whilst having the cash available when you need it.</p>
<p>Like a lot of our peers, we are looking to increase our own presence globally, so requests for new currencies will inevitably come onto the horizon. We may also look into launching fund products that reflect the second tier.</p>
<p>Another trend that we are seeing is that some clients are slightly fearful of some of the sovereign risk out there at the moment, particularly in Europe and some of the Mediterranean countries. Consequently, an investment that might traditionally have been a straightforward money market fund investment may now become a separate account, as clients are showing some nervousness towards sovereign risk.</p>
<h5 id="how-is-the-industry-as-a-whole-likely-to-develop">How is the industry as a whole likely to develop?</h5>
<p>We think there will continue to be consolidation in the investment management area, and particularly the short duration money market base, for some of the reasons that I outlined as to why treasurers might not want to be able to do some of this internally. Independent credit research and the sort of risk controls you need to manage cash at the highest level require both a number of analysts and an extensive IT infrastructure and without scale, this may not be feasible.</p>
<p>We are also seeing a realisation that you do need to have the infrastructure to do this. The cost of that infrastructure is a barrier to entry. We might see some of the firms that got out of this business a couple of years ago try to go into it again, but we think it’s difficult to position yourself credibly in this area without having the resources.</p></div>

<h4 class="fn">Kathleen Hughes</h4>
<h5 class="title">Managing Director, Head of Global Liquidity EMEA</h5>
<img alt="J.P. Morgan logo" class="logo" height="20" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/jpmorgan-logo-2012-100x20.png" title="J.P. Morgan" width="100"/>
<p>Kathleen Hughes, Managing Director, is Head of the Global Liquidity business in EMEA focusing primarily on Institutional Liquidity Funds. An employee since 1990, Kathleen was previously head of the corporate sales strategy and head of the relationship management strategy for the Global Liquidity business in Europe. Before joining J.P. Morgan Asset Management, she was a relationship manager and business development officer for the Wealthy Family Group in J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. Kathleen obtained a BA in Economics from the University of Richmond, USA.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="how-did-cash-investment-processes-and-policies-change-as-a-result-of-this">The credit crisis impacted everyone in the corporate cash management industry. How did cash investment processes and policies change as a result of this?</h5>
<p>The credit crisis certainly refocused attention on best practices, especially around investment policies and processes. In the landscape that defined the world prior to the summer of 2007 – a landscape in which investors were hunting for yield at all costs – there was less focus on investment policy than we see today. I would also argue that investment policies had lapsed and, until the credit crisis, policies had not been tested since the market volatility following the events of September 2001.</p>
<p>As a result, when the crisis hit, particularly in September 2008, the knee jerk reaction of some treasurers, CFOs and boards was to put all cash into government securities. This may have resulted from a lack of faith in the investment policy or may have been an indication that the policy actually did not work once it faced a real life stress test.</p>
<p>Last year we saw renewed interest by corporates in reviewing their policies and evaluating how well they endured the market volatility of 2008. To assist corporates in this endeavour, we analysed over 200 corporate treasury policies and developed a white paper to share with them as to what we saw as the most effective investment policies and best practices.</p>
<h5 id="what-elements-should-treasurers-consider-when-structuring-an-investment-policy">What elements should treasurers consider when structuring an investment policy?</h5>
<p>Organisations should institute a documented policy which ensures that everyone from the treasury analyst to the board of directors shares a clear, common understanding of their objectives and permissible investments. Specific elements to consider should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Define procedures that outline whether to keep or sell a security when it falls out of compliance with the investment policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Track both interest rate and spread duration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Address diversification by security type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluate pooled investment vehicles such as money market funds for quality and stability if used.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="do-you-find-that-investors-are-doing-more-of-their-own-due-diligence-on-investments-and-investment-service-providers-now">Do you find that investors are doing more of their own due diligence on investments and investment service providers now?</h5>
<p>The level of due diligence that clients and prospects now perform has increased significantly. Not only are prospects doing deep dives into all aspects of the investment process, credit team, risk controls, operational procedures and prospectus language, they are also conducting annual or semi-annual reviews. Closing the sale and bringing the client on board is not the end, it’s really just the beginning of a relationship based on transparency and ongoing due diligence.</p>
<p>This culture is now ingrained in how we work with clients. In early 2009 we kicked off a series of Investor Forums in major US, Asian and European cities, taking our senior management team to see clients and provide them with an in-depth review of our processes. We also wanted to share with clients the work we’ve been doing with industry groups, regulators and others to help bring positive changes to our industry. To date, we’ve had over 900 clients attend these forums and the popularity of this format ensures that it will continue.</p>
<p>Liquidity clients are also taking a page out of the way that traditional institutional investment management clients have operated. They are using due diligence questionnaires to screen potential managers and to eliminate existing managers that don’t measure up. Due diligence isn’t contained to the manager either; it extends to the broader context of how the funds are structured and how they operate. For example, we’ve had clients who required information on the service providers we use: the custodians and sub-custodial relationships, the banks, and the transfer agent. The hard lessons learned around counterparty risk are still front and centre and clients want to understand exactly how the money moves through the system when they redeem assets from our funds.</p>
<p>We’ve also had clients who have focused on governance and the independent board structure of our funds. We are one of the few managers outside of the US to employ an independent board structure and clients like to see this as it represents good governance. They’ve also asked for biographies on our board members to get a better understanding of the expertise that our board of directors brings to the funds.</p>
<h5 id="what-advice-would-you-give-them-to-make-sound-investment-decisions">With liquidity management as the top concern for treasurers at the moment, what advice would you give them to make sound investment decisions?</h5>
<p>When analysing investments, managers like us, as well as treasurers, need to look beyond credit and interest rate risk and concentrate on the dangers of liquidity risk. Almost everyone involved in investing in short-term credit markets was surprised by the reality that even high-quality securities are not immune from contagion risk. Even if securities are of high credit quality and their issuers are financially stable, they can still be affected by investor concerns regarding the sector in which the issuer operates or the type of security.</p>
<p>During the credit crisis, for example, concerns about banks affected securities issued within the financial sector indiscriminately, leading to heightened volatility across the entire sector. Contagion risk can lead to illiquidity even in high-quality securities, and the impact needs to be considered, regardless of whether the treasurer intends to keep holding the investment or sell it.</p>
<p>Should the company need to sell securities during the period of illiquidity then it may have to accept capital losses; if treasurers intend to keep holding the security, they may still need to report an unrealised loss if the mark-to-market value of a security falls. Organisations need to discuss how contagion events should be handled. This should be done in the context of the organisation’s agreed tolerances for gains and losses.</p>
<p>Another aspect of liquidity risk that needs to be considered is the liquidity provided by deposits that are guaranteed by government rescue plans. Even government guaranteed deposits need to be assessed in terms of risk – for example, what delays on liquidity might take place should an event arise that triggers the guarantee?</p>
<h5 id="how-has-the-role-of-the-treasurer-changed-over-the-last-two-years">Did the current economic environment increase the importance of corporate treasury departments and if so, how has the role of the treasurer changed over the last two years?</h5>
<p>As a result of the financial market uncertainty and challenges of the last few years, investment returns for corporate cash investments have hovered at all time historic lows. In the past, the performance of many corporate treasurers was largely based on their ability to provide investment returns. However, today’s investment environment is much more complex. It may not be completely fair to evaluate a corporate treasurer’s performance based solely on investment returns.</p>
<p>Corporate treasurers now need to articulate and demonstrate their unique value to their organisation, including senior management and the board of directors. They need to discuss the strategies they employ for navigating market uncertainties and how they make informed investment decisions. Accurate reporting of cash, liquidity and counterparty exposure across the entire organisation is critical to the treasurer’s role.</p>
<h5 id="how-can-treasurers-improve-the-return-on-their-surplus-cash">Now that money markets have stabilised but short-term interest rates remain close to zero, how can treasurers improve the return on their surplus cash?</h5>
<p>If treasurers have the tools to perform effective cash flow forecasting, they may have the ability to invest surplus cash in a strategy that is not geared towards daily liquidity and could potentially achieve higher returns. We recently completed our annual J.P. Morgan Global Cash Management Survey and we asked treasurers what risk were they willing to take in return for higher yield. 65% of respondents said “none”! Clearly the appetite for risk has not yet returned across the board and may never return when it comes to cash and where the sole investment objective is capital preservation. However, 19% of respondents were willing to take some degree of duration risk in return for increased yield. Very few respondents would take other risks such as credit risk, liquidity risk or foreign exchange risk in return for higher yield. For treasurers with surplus cash and a 12-month investment horizon, we are discussing strategies that take advantage of increasing interest rate risk but still maintain a high credit quality portfolio.</p>
<h5 id="what-should-treasurers-consider-when-deciding-if-seeking-additional-investment-income-is-an-appropriate-and-feasible-course-of-action">What should treasurers consider when deciding if seeking additional investment income is an appropriate and feasible course of action?</h5>
<p>This is a common question of late from our corporate clients.</p>
<p>First, as mentioned above, treasurers must have an accurate picture of their cash position now and in the future. If there isn’t sufficient surplus cash or if there is low visibility on the use of cash, then perhaps a strategy looking to target higher yield may not be appropriate. Next, if there is visibility and enough surplus cash, a treasurer should look to segment that cash, dividing working capital cash from longer term ‘strategic’ or ‘reserve’ cash. These two classifications can describe cash that will not be needed for nine months or longer or have no short-term forecasted use. With this cash, a treasurer can employ an investment strategy that has a longer investment horizon.</p>
<p>Next, a treasurer needs to consider the tolerance for volatility – specifically tolerance for losses and expectations for return over time. Other aspects to this that must be considered include acceptable realised losses in a given period; any accounting restrictions on realising capital gains; accounting treatment in general on mark-to-market gains or losses and how they will be reported to the business; and finally, deciding an appropriate impairment policy.</p>
<p>Once these issues have been considered, the next decision is what type of risk is appropriate. Most clients are comfortable with duration risk but less comfortable in taking on additional credit risk. For clients who determine that they can extend maturity and take duration risk, the shape of the yield curve and the interest rate cycle become the next two important determining factors.</p>
<p>For clients who are willing to take on credit risk, they need to think about managing credit risk and the tools and resources that go into building an internal credit team to supplement the work that credit agencies do in assigning credit ratings. If clients do not wish to invest in credit resources, this is one area that they can outsource by hiring a professional investment manager such as J.P. Morgan.</p>
<h5 id="what-can-we-expect-to-see-in-the-near-future">What regulatory changes have recently taken place and what can we expect to see in the near future?</h5>
<p>We’ve seen regulatory changes and acute interest in this industry from both sides of the Atlantic. The unprecedented market events and the steps that the US government had to take to backstop the US money market industry do not come without a price. The price is increased scrutiny by regulators and central banks.</p>
<p>Some of these changes have already been announced, such as the strengthening of rule 2a-7 by the SEC in the US and changes for the Institutional Money Market Funds Association (IMMFA) in the international arena. We fully expect ongoing scrutiny and further changes to the industry throughout 2010.</p>
<p>That said, one thing to keep in mind in light of current and future changes to the global money market funds industry is that the nearly $4 trillion invested in money market funds globally provides vital funding to the developed world’s economies. For example, in the US, money market funds hold 45% of commercial paper, 65% of short-term state and local government debt and 26% of short-term US Treasury and agency securities.</p>
<p>Regulators and central banks are keenly aware of the role that money market funds play in the funding of the global financial system. They understand that fundamental changes to the structure of our industry must be made delicately if a monumental disruption to short-term credit markets is to be avoided.</p></div>

</div>
<h5 id="what-trends-are-you-seeing-in-the-treasury-market-at-the-moment">What trends are you seeing in the treasury market at the moment?</h5>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>AW:</span> As a result of the events of the last two years, successful organisations and their boards are now much more aware of the role and importance of the treasury function. This means there is a much greater level of scrutiny over long held risk management policies to re-assess their suitability in the current environment.</p>
<p>This has, in turn, led to increased demand for a deep and thorough analysis of these policies to validate and quantify their contribution to shareholder value. As a trusted risk adviser, Lloyds has continued to invest in developing its capabilities to address our clients’ needs. Specifically, this means broadening our range of expertise, for instance in IFRS accounting and financial risk management areas.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span>CD:</span> As Andrew has outlined, corporate treasurers are going to be focusing much more on their treasury policy in this volatile environment and this includes, of course, their hedging policies. Are the company’s hedging policies still relevant? And do the stress scenarios that have been used in the past need to be looked at in a new light?</p>
</div>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>AW:</span> The other big change is a renewed focus on counterparty risk, with a much greater focus than in the recent past on a broader range of metrics when deciding who to deal with than simply price.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span>CD:</span> This is something that has also been reflected on the cash side: chasing yield is now the second priority, after counterparty risk.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="are-there-any-particular-products-that-your-clients-are-asking-for-today-and-if-so-why">Are there any particular products that your clients are asking for today, and if so, why?</h5>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span>CD:</span> In FX, there’s far more interest in flexible hedging products than we have seen before. We’ve seen much greater volatility in the currency markets this year, and this makes certain derivative structures far more attractive in terms of pricing and their pay-off profile.</p>
<p>On the cash side, we’re in a low rate environment and this is increasing the attractiveness of enhanced-yield products. So yes, counterparty risk is a priority, but there are still clients we’re speaking to who do want to try to enhance yield. They understand that enhanced yield means accepting a small amount of extra risk and are willing to accept it. However, our approach is not just from a yield-enhancement perspective, but also incorporating their FX risk with products such as dual currency deposits, which are increasingly popular as they can provide an element of FX hedging and an increased yield.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>AW:</span> As for interest rates and inflation hedging, we definitely have gone ‘back to basics’, with corporates using simpler instruments to meet their risk management needs. However, a more in-depth view would show that there is a greater appreciation that option-based products can offer equal, or greater, value in certain circumstances. This is the case, for example, as corporates balance the cost of moving out along the yield curve against the risk of a significant shock to rates as and when quantitative easing is withdrawn.</p>
<p>This poses challenges around hedge accounting, so we are having regular dialogue with corporates on how they can, for instance, bifurcate the trades to minimise P&amp;L volatility or, if that is not possible, helping them to quantify that volatility to allow for such products to be catered for within their risk management policies and framework. We also help clients in their communications with the market where they decide not to apply hedge accounting to relatively simple solutions against which hedge accounting rules unfairly discriminate.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="how-would-you-describe-risk-appetite-at-the-moment-have-you-seen-any-shift-at-all">How would you describe risk appetite at the moment? Have you seen any shift at all?</h5>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>AW:</span> I think that sovereign debt concerns, notably in Greece, have shown once again just how quickly market liquidity can vanish and how highly volatile rates and FX can be.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span>CD:</span> While risk appetite is low, risk management has probably never been higher in a treasurer’s mind. Through regular interaction with our clients, we believe risk management is now at the front of mind of other senior managers. For instance, we’re seeing more Finance Directors involved in these decisions than ever before.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="how-does-lloyds-address-the-needs-of-its-clients">How does Lloyds address the needs of its clients?</h5>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>AW:</span> Relationship banking is the cornerstone of Lloyds’ approach. Our teams in Corporate Banking, Risk Management and Capital Markets are all set up along sector lines. The teams meet regularly to brainstorm themes that might be impacting any particular sector, and we pride ourselves on the deep ‘due diligence’ that we undertake ahead of client meetings to ensure we are talking to clients about their requirements.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, Lloyds Banking Group was recognised as ‘Bank of the Year’ for the sixth year in a row in the Financial Director’s Excellence Awards for the ongoing support it has given business customers throughout the downturn. What’s important is that this is voted for by customers – more than 1,000 UK Financial Directors.</p>
<p>Other good examples of how we address the needs of our clients include the series of events we held for corporates across the country timed to coincide with the UK election, addressing the economic challenges the next government will face, and a seminar highlighting the potential impact of the proposed OTC derivative regulation. By being proactive in this way, we’re helping customers to understand what is affecting them and how they can overcome these hurdles.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span>CD:</span> We also offer tailored services to fit the needs of specific clients. For instance, we were working with a FTSE 100 retailer where the treasury looks after all the different subsidiaries, and they wanted us to produce a presentation to educate and explain to their buyers what the FX risks were, and how the market movements on a daily basis were actually impacting them. This was posted on their intranet site and as a result of our presentation, their buyers are now able to better negotiate prices with their suppliers.</p>
<p>Treasurers often have to face unforeseen market events such as the recent heightened concerns regarding sovereign issuers including those in the Eurozone. Consequently, corporates are left facing a market where implied volatility, a measure of how expensive option contracts are, is high and where the ‘skew’ in the options market has made buying protection against sterling or euro depreciation expensive. Net US dollar buyers for instance, are faced with the dilemma of hedging at historically unattractive rates, or adopting a ‘wait and see’ approach in the hope the markets return to long-term averages. The temptation to wait and see is exacerbated by many economists’ view that markets will ‘mean revert’ to more favourable levels.</p>
<p>As a result we are talking to our clients about trades that they have entered into before the market fallout that may currently yield large positive mark to markets in their favour. We are able to use this positive position to restructure existing trades and extend the tenor of their hedging programmes at better rates than the current market.</p>
<p>We are also seeing clients who have unhedged exposures but are not willing to lock in at unfavourable prevailing market rates. The desire to achieve budget rates higher than current market rates supersedes the desire to achieve hedge accounting and as such ‘out-performance trades’ that make use of leverage, knock-in and knock-out features have grown in popularity.</p>
<p>Finally, corporates may have entered into hedges that use leverage, knock-in and knock-out features prior to the market fallout, and we look to see if there is value in restructuring these trades to either alleviate the pressure on barrier levels or to take advantage of current market conditions and restructure at more favourable rates.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="in-what-way-does-your-offering-set-you-apart-from-your-competitors-in-the-risk-management-space">In what way does your offering set you apart from your competitors in the risk management space?</h5>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span>CD:</span> Service is a key differentiator for us, and how we approach the customer. We look to work with the clients to identify and evaluate the financial risks they’re exposed to. We also look to comprehend the underlying business, and we try to develop our ideas and strategies, whether FX or rates, around the company’s culture, their values and their visions for hedging. The resources we have got behind us, such as our IFRS consultants, our economic research and our derivatives structuring teams – all contribute to an overall trusted risk advisory position which clients really appreciate. We also offer an array of tactical market indicators for interest rates and foreign exchange which our clients can use to help determine hedging strategies within their tactical scope.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>AW:</span> Trust permeates everything we do in relation to our clients: in the Greenwich Quality Index we recently got a series of very high scores across a wide range of metrics, and I think that shows real traction with our clients based on a very co-ordinated relationship banking approach.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="how-can-lloyds-help-its-clients-to-manage-risk-in-a-holistic-manner">How can Lloyds help its clients to manage risk in a holistic manner?</h5>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>AW:</span> Our typical approach to a corporate client involves a significant amount of analysis around capital structure, peer analysis, sector analysis and so forth. We also like to provide analysis that is ‘product neutral’, which ensures that any proposals we make are focused on the value add for the client rather than championing any particular product range, or any particular team within the bank itself. The most important thing is that we meet, and many times exceed, the client’s requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span>CD:</span> I think the other side of this is the people, and those who we’ve hired in the last two years: we’ve had two organisations come together and really, we’ve got the best of both worlds. To have that kind of intellectual capital within our offering, I think does differentiate us with the wealth of experience that these people bring with them.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-plans-do-you-have-for-expansion-over-the-next-24-months">What plans do you have for expansion over the next 24 months?</h5>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>AW:</span> In 2009 we were busy delivering the integration of Lloyds TSB and HBOS to form the new Lloyds Banking Group and, as Colin said, we’ve got great people in the business now from across the two organisations. Everybody is really energised and is incredibly enthusiastic about applying our trusted risk adviser approach to a wider universe of clients.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span>CD:</span> We’re going to continue to listen to our customers. Being a banking partner through the cycle is at the core of our relationship banking approach. It’s essential always to work hard to understand your clients and how you can help them deliver solutions they really want. We will therefore focus on continuing to build out our emerging market offering, building out our e-capabilities using market-leading technology and complementing this with investment in other areas such as capital markets. Our view is that you can always improve on what you’re offering with people and products and that will also be a focus going forward.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-do-you-believe-will-be-the-hot-treasury-topics-in-2011">What do you believe will be the hot treasury topics in 2011?</h5>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span>CD:</span> Starting with FX, we’ve seen sterling depreciate significantly this year, and our chief economist, Trevor Williams is forecasting continued weakness into next year but as volatility has been on the rise recently, bouts of strength are to be expected.</p>
<p>This means corporates are going to have to get used to a weaker sterling and adapt their budgets and their hedging policies accordingly. Moving to more dynamic hedging strategies could yield benefits and so could a willingness to restructure existing hedges when appropriate. With this in mind, we intend to remain in regular dialogue with our customers in order to ensure we can provide the advice and assistance needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>AW:</span> Diversification of funding sources will remain a priority – and Lloyds is well positioned here with its strong debt and equity capital markets capabilities. I also believe that the strength of the two-way relationship between bank and corporate will continue to be pre-eminent.</p>

He fulfilled a number of functions at Hypo-Vereinsbank before joining Commerzbank in 2004, where he subsequently held various management positions, eg in operations, credit and process management.</p>
<p>Mr. Sieber has been Head of Cash Management and International Business (CMIB) at the Mittelstandsbank since April 2008.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-is-the-structure-and-strategy-of-the-cash-management-and-international-business-cmib-unit-within-commerzbank">What is the structure and strategy of the Cash Management and International Business (CMIB) unit within Commerzbank?</h5>
<p>Firstly, it is important to understand that Commerzbank is a customer focused bank, not a product focused bank. We have a relationship orientated business model, and the product lines follow this model. My product line, which is cash management and international business, is part of the corporate banking unit. To explain what is behind cash management and international business worldwide: on one side there is the customer focus, and on the other is the product orientated organisation. Cash management and international business really means worldwide responsibility from New York, via our domestic network here in Germany for example, to Central and Eastern Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>We combined the business of cash management services, payment services, pooling structures, treasury and advisory services, together with our international business in 2004. The international side covers structured export and trade finance alongside our documentary and guarantee business. We therefore cover the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Corporate accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cash pooling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Payment services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Documentary and guarantee business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ECA-based finance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trade finance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our general strategy is to establish Commerzbank as a leading German bank for cash management solutions in Europe, and when we are talking about Europe, we are also talking about the Eastern European countries which will sooner or later become part of the Eurozone. We have the main customer relationships for German corporates within the International Business unit, and what is important for us is the link between domestic and international branches. If you look at the German market, you can see that savings and loan associations are not in a position to have this link between domestic and international branches because they are regionally focused, not internationally focused.</p>
<h5 id="what-has-changed-for-cmib-over-the-past-two-years">What has changed for CMIB over the past two years?</h5>
<p>The biggest change for us was the merger of Commerzbank and Dresdner Bank. It is by far the biggest merger of any German bank, and very successful for us since the international cash management service of Dresdner Bank is first rate. As a result of the merger we have opened two additional branches – one in Vienna and one in Zurich, which will greatly improve our cash management reach.</p>
<p>Cash management is really an IT-driven business. I think the IT integration between the two businesses is the biggest challenge we face on the cash management side. The business case for integrating both systems is driven by cost savings: if you work with the same IT system on the operational side, processes can be carried out more effectively and economies of scale can be achieved.</p>
<h5 id="what-changes-have-clients-seen-as-a-result-of-the-merger">What changes have clients seen as a result of the merger?</h5>
<p>What is important for the customer is that the new Commerzbank has more geographical presence as a result of the merger. Dresdner customers benefit from the expertise and reach that Commerzbank has in Central and Eastern Europe as well as in other regions globally. Commerzbank customers can benefit from the international cash management structures Dresdner has in place, which will be fully integrated into the Commerzbank system.</p>
<h5 id="do-you-think-sepa-is-starting-to-make-a-difference-for-clients">Do you think SEPA is starting to make a difference for clients?</h5>
<p>We have a strong commitment to SEPA and have invested in it significantly. This means that we adapted our internal structures, processes and platforms in time for the introduction of both the SEPA Credit Transfer and SEPA Direct Debit. As such, we are well prepared for our customers and fulfil the necessary SEPA requirements. We are of the opinion that by actively promoting the adoption of SEPA, banks can offer new solutions to their customers.</p>
<p>SEPA is not only an issue for the banking sector however, it also has a profound impact on how the corporate sectors administer their business. As well as creating opportunities for sharing the development and implementation of standardisation projects within the economy, corporates will also benefit directly from the cost savings associated with standardised payments.</p>
<p>Certainly, SEPA will have its benefits, but corporates will have to invest in the consolidation and adaptation of their systems to make use of the new formats. As the existing formats are not yet being phased out, with no set end-date, nothing is really pushing corporates to use the new SEPA formats.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, SEPA will, given time, deliver benefits to the economy as a whole. I believe that SEPA offers opportunities to the corporate sphere and banking sector to overcome some of the key challenges they are now facing.</p>
<h5 id="how-is-technology-developing-and-facilitating-commerzbanks-approach-to-cash-management">How is technology developing and facilitating Commerzbank’s approach to cash management?</h5>
<p>One of the main things we are doing in terms of International Business is supporting clients through our TREASURY product, which is part of our Corporate Banking Portal. This special product allows the customer to access their liquidity positions and all of their forecasts together so that they really have a set-up for a worldwide liquidity forecast in such a system. TREASURY is web-based, so can be accessed anywhere using a standard web browser. It is a multi-bank solution, which allows bank accounts from all over the world to be integrated into the system, provided they use SWIFT MT940 messages.</p>
<p>Delivering efficient cash pooling structures that are tailored to the needs of each company is really a core focus for us. We will continue to offer small and medium enterprises and large corporations all the cash pooling, target and zero balancing and notional pooling they would expect of a bank like Commerzbank. What we are also offering is domestic and international cash pooling services, including multicurrency capabilities, because that’s simply what our customers are asking of us. We support physical and virtual pooling, like margin compensating, where these are allowed. Due to the circumstances I think this is an area where only large banks are in a position to offer this service to the customer.</p>
<p>What’s also important are supply chain management solutions because, especially in the conditions of the financial market crisis, we see that traders and those companies which do not have much equity on their balance sheet need solutions where they can put the ends of the supply chain finance together. Within the scope of financial supply chain management our main focus is not on the technical aspect but on a holistic approach putting together various financial instruments for improving the cash flow within the value chain of the exporting and importing company.</p>
<p>Together with other international banks, Commerzbank is a member of the workgroup SWIFT TSU (Trade Service Utility), which is an online platform offered by SWIFT for matching and financing invoices via an open account.</p>
<p>What we see in the cash management service is that customers are not putting all their eggs in one basket. Before the financial market crisis customers went for one stop, one bank solutions. And due to the financial market crisis customers now wonder whether this is really a good solution, and if it is not better perhaps to put euro into one pooling structure, US dollar into another pooling structure and the Asian currencies – you cannot really pool them – into one virtual structure. And you are doing this with three different banks rather than one, because then the risk for the corporate is not the same. So I think what you can see in the market is that things have changed a little bit; the customer is thinking about the risks involved and how technology can minimise these.</p>
<h5 id="do-you-think-companies-will-be-investing-more-in-risk-technology">Do you think companies will be investing more in risk technology?</h5>
<p>We talked to treasury departments and they said, ‘Yes, we want to invest a lot of money.’ But the real story behind this is they are not investing because of the effect of the economic crisis on budgets. If you invest in a really good treasury system within a company, and in the straight through processing infrastructure behind, you have to invest a lot of money. But corporates feel in many cases is, ‘OK it would be a good solution for us, but please come later when times are not so hard.’</p>
<p>What corporates are doing instead is a lot of information management and cash concentrating; they can do without large investments on the corporate side. Understandably, corporates are deciding to wait rather than invest now because they really do not know about the economic situation they will be facing in 2010 or 2011.</p>
<h5 id="what-do-you-believe-2010-has-in-store-for-the-world-of-cash-management">What do you believe 2010 has in store for the world of cash management?</h5>
<p>The key focus for treasurers now is to concentrate cash and to get all the information they possibly can about the company’s cash flows. And why is this important? One of the main reasons is that it’s difficult for treasurers to get enough credit facilities, so they have to focus on collecting their cash and managing their cash position because it’s not possible to get all liquidity from the market.</p>
<p>At Commerzbank, we believe that the movement towards centralisation of cash and treasury management offices will become stronger during the course of 2010. We think the trend for consolidation will also continue to apply to related finance functions, such as payables and receivables. While this may take some time to filter through to clients, we firmly believe that it simply does not make sense to concentrate all your cash if you’re not doing the same with your payables and receivables.</p>
<p>I think we will also witness a further development of payment factories. In the market for outgoing payments, from the corporate view, we see a lot of payment factories. But I imagine the payment factories will get further developed into the incoming payments side. The question is – as always – when?</p>
<p>What we also expect to see throughout the year, especially for larger companies, is that SWIFT for Corporates will become more popular. For the large companies, this is an excellent, viable solution to eliminate the need for multiple proprietary bank connectivity.</p>
<p>While we have heard it said many times, cash is still king in 2010. This is really the driver of cash management and also of the treasury information behind this. Risk management is another key driver for treasury – what you can see is that a lot of large companies are looking at the risk coming from abroad, so they are thinking about what is the right risk structure, or what is the risk appetite they have for business abroad. I believe this will be something new to watch out for in the cash management space this year.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>This month we speak to Beat von Gunten about the challenges, opportunities and priorities for treasurers in 2010. We discuss topical issues ranging from credit availability to relationship banking as well as J.P. Morgan Treasury Services’ global strategy for the coming year.</p>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Beat von Gunten</h4>
<h5 class="title">Managing Director and Head of Corporate and Public Sector Sales</h5>
<img alt="J.P. Morgan logo" class="logo" height="20" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/jpmorgan-logo-2012-100x20.png" title="J.P. Morgan" width="100"/>
<p>Based in London, Mr von Gunten is responsible for providing treasury advisory, working capital management, and core transaction-based services across the European region. Previously, Mr von Gunten was global head of J.P. Morgan’s Structured Investments Distributor Marketing (SIDM) business. The group distributed structured products across asset classes.</p>
<p>Mr von Gunten has been with J.P. Morgan for nine years, joining in March 2000. He initially joined to build the institutional equity derivatives business before becoming head of EMEA for structured products across asset classes in 2006. Prior to joining J.P. Morgan, Mr von Gunten worked at Sarasin Asset Management in London and Basel, Switzerland from 1995 to 2000. Before joining Sarasin in 1995, Mr von Gunten spent four years in New York and Boston respectively, working for a US Macro Hedge Fund and a US Investment Bank.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-is-jp-morgan-doing-to-help-its-clients-prepare-for-growth">With signs of recovery in the US, Asia and parts of Europe, what is J.P. Morgan doing to help its clients prepare for growth?</h5>
<p>Since our Treasury Services franchise is a fully integrated part of J.P. Morgan’s core businesses, we are in a very good position to help our clients better understand where their focus needs to be in order to remain financially stable and market competitive. Working closely with our Investment Banking colleagues, we gain a broader view of the challenges our clients face. Cash management and trade tend to be the fundamental foundation of a company’s ability to operate, having this understanding collectively gives us a greater ability to consult with our clients confidently, and dare I suggest, with prudence.</p>
<p>Going forward, financial stability will be crucial for those companies looking to fully leverage the growth opportunities presented by the recovery. Working in close partnership we are helping our clients to get a head start – after all, why wait for the full recovery to begin before preparing for it?</p>
<p>To that end, one of our roles is to review the client’s processes throughout their supply chain, while looking at their banking structures and related IT platforms. This allows us to identify any problem areas and bottlenecks. We also assist clients in looking beyond basic cash management processes and address a wider spectrum of potential opportunities for efficiency, mitigating risk and unlocking working capital.</p>
<p>Our experience in global markets is in itself an excellent resource for our clients: they are particularly keen to gain our advice on their current arrangements. Therefore we see many requests for analysis and benchmarking of latest trends and opportunities. This is an area that we are continuing to invest in.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, one of the simplest and yet most effective ways of adding value has been in facilitating introductions between clients who may currently have, or have been through, related challenges. These meetings have been received extremely well as it allows the sharing of best practice among those who are experts in the field of treasury.</p>
<p>From our perspective, it allows us to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges they are facing. This gives us the opportunity of offering a broader range of cash and working capital solutions that, combined with a consultative approach, are helping clients to derive efficiencies from their banking, technology and risk management infrastructures.</p>
<p>At J.P. Morgan, we have a proud history dating back over 100 years of supporting our clients and the overall well-being of the financial services industry, throughout all economic conditions. Now, more than ever, we are determined to ensure that this tradition continues to help stimulate recovery and growth going forward.</p>
<h5 id="are-we-likely-to-see-an-increase-in-appetite-from-the-banks-during-2010">There was a great deal of discussion around the lack of credit availability during 2009. Are we likely to see an increase in appetite from the banks during 2010?</h5>
<p>J.P. Morgan and its peers continue to lend in this environment. I fully appreciate credit to be a critical demonstration of commitment to a sustained relationship. At J.P. Morgan we are in a position to provide the appropriate support to our clients in many different guises. I believe that listening to clients is my most important role. Our business is in a far superior position than where we were five years ago from a product, service and coverage aspect. To that end, we are able to confidently discuss the challenges our clients face, help them take full advantage of opportunities, and provide the necessary solutions (including related capital requirements), allowing them to achieve their ambitions that will add long-term value to their organisation.</p>
<p>Before the crisis, during and well after, J.P. Morgan’s policy is to lend in accordance with prudent risk management and underwriting standards, and be ever mindful of market and credit risks.</p>
<p>Many of the discussions that took place in 2009 around the significant tightening of credit might not have been looked at in the wider context it needs to fully appreciate the situation. In the United States for example, non-bank lenders, such as money market funds and hedge funds, constituted 70% of the credit markets. These institutions provided credit through their holdings in commercial paper. However, as their investors scaled back, the institutions had to do the same, either by not extending credit or by dramatically shortening the duration of the commercial paper they were willing to purchase. The consequence was a tightening of liquidity in the financial markets, which led to concerns over availability of credit.</p>
<h5 id="what-advice-can-you-give-clients-in-managing-their-liquidity-today">Given the lessons learnt from the height of the credit crisis 18 months ago, what advice can you give clients in managing their liquidity today?</h5>
<p>Our first piece of advice is to ensure that an appropriate set of board, treasury and underlying investment policies should be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect a rapidly changing environment. Counterparty risk management and preservation of capital through secure investments has to be the primary element of managing liquidity.</p>
<p>The improvement of visibility, efficiency and control through centralisation is also a key liquidity lesson. We continue to be proactive in this space by working with clients to assess the most appropriate strategy in reviewing their funding requirements against liquidity. We are therefore advising our clients to look beyond primary investment cash at the centre, and to review options for gaining visibility of, and releasing, trapped cash within the group.</p>
<p>This may be achieved through reducing down the impact of withholding tax, creating integrated global liquidity structures, or simply using cash for more effective working capital management, such as collateralisation. The overall goal then is higher returns, lower costs and simplified information reporting and reconciliation.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-the-priorities-for-corporate-treasurers-during-2010-and-beyond">In your view, what are the priorities for corporate treasurers during 2010 and beyond?</h5>
<p>The role of the corporate treasurer continues to evolve and become an ever more significant position in a company’s hierarchy. Before the downturn, there were not many people other than the CEO and CFO who had a complete 360 degree view of the supply chain. Increasingly we’re seeing treasurers taking on more of that responsibility, receiving a wider remit within the business and therefore a greater opportunity to impact the bottom line.</p>
<p>The constant priority though must be ensuring that an appropriate funding strategy is in place to safeguard the growth ambitions that a company may have and at the same time maintain an adequate level of liquidity which is accessible should conditions deteriorate. As such, treasurers should be asking themselves a number of tough questions this year, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What is the right amount of liquidity to make sure we can meet all of our expected and unexpected funding needs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How frequently do we have to tap into reserve cash and is it too often?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is our cash flow forecasting accurate enough to be truly useful?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do we have a complete picture of where, when and how payments across the organisation are being made?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Increased visibility and optimal forecasting are a must in being able to accurately understand how cash flows will adjust the need for seeking alternative funding sources if not immediately accessible.</p>
<p>Therefore, cash and working capital management will undoubtedly dominate in 2010 and beyond, with the corporate treasurer focused on ensuring that they have an established banking group that can provide a broad range of services to address the ongoing thirst for efficiency and risk management.</p>
<h5 id="in-what-ways-is-jp-morgan-helping-its-clients-to-increase-their-working-capital">In what ways is J.P. Morgan helping its clients to increase their working capital?</h5>
<p>Effective working capital management is achieved through a variety of disciplines, all of which ultimately contribute to the bottom line, although some are more obvious than others. Recently, we’ve witnessed an increased focus on the basics of cash management; whether effective account structuring through rationalisation, appropriate currency account location and the tools to facilitate visibility, or simply reduction of overall bank fees.</p>
<p>As I alluded to, the more challenged capital markets have also led to more focus on alternative funding sources, whether through structured trade solutions or ‘internal’ cash. J.P. Morgan has developed a broad range of options from receivables financing through to pre-export finance and supply chain financing, as well as a range of payment instruments that are integrated together to realise significant working capital management improvements for our clients.</p>
<p>Over five years ago, our Treasury Services franchise developed a strong and comprehensive strategy to look at active working capital management throughout the supply chain. This strategy has been built upon to the extent that it’s not just a trade proposition; it encompasses everything that a corporate does on a daily basis. This means that at each stage of the physical and financial supply chain, whether that’s during the development, production, distribution or settlement stages, we have developed products and services that are aligned to deliver value.</p>
<p>Working together with our clients through a structured set of analytics, including industry and peer based comparisons; we help identify opportunities for enhancement of existing structures or implementation of new ones, to drive improved working capital ratios.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-jp-morgans-approach-in-managing-relationships-with-its-clients">What is J.P. Morgan’s approach in managing relationships with its clients?</h5>
<p>This has been a particular topic of interest since the onset of the financial crisis as many banks have found it hard to give their clients the support they need through the tough times. At J.P. Morgan, we view all relationships with our clients as long-term and sustainable.</p>
<p>By integrating with the other core J.P. Morgan lines of business, our Treasury Services franchise is able to take a more holistic view of the client’s overall relationship with the bank and demonstrate to our clients that their business is understood and valued across our firm.</p>
<p>Through the consultative approach that we have already discussed, we hope to create more value through understanding a client’s business drivers and priorities, matching solutions that address these needs and are appropriate to the particular industry, geography and sector that they operate in.</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan’s approach to relationships, therefore, is one of tremendous discipline and focus, through regular dialogue and proactive actions. Above all, we are strategic advisors as well as providers of value added solutions.</p>
<h5 id="what-can-the-market-expect-from-jp-morgan-treasury-services-in-the-coming-year">What can the market expect from J.P. Morgan Treasury Services in the coming year?</h5>
<p>In a nutshell, the market can expect ongoing commitment; J.P. Morgan will continue to enhance its global footprint, and its technology, payment, reporting and investment platforms. The momentum that commenced during 2008 of increased local coverage and capability will also propel Treasury Services forward. We want to go where our clients want, need and expect us to be. We want them to have the right support, speak to local knowledgeable people who will listen and are empowered to take action.</p>
<p>By adopting this more open and proactive approach to corporate banking, we can make sure that the relationship is really working both ways. For example, one of the greatest advantages for us of facilitating the client meetings, which I mentioned earlier, has been the ability to increase our value proposition by developing solutions our clients need, rather than what we think is best.</p>
<p>In addition, we are constantly seeking innovation in the supply chain space, an area where we continue to see opportunities for the corporate treasurer to be involved in assessing opportunities to unlock working capital.</p>
<p>Essentially, we are here for our clients in a consultative manner and believe we are operating from a position of strength and stability. After all, this is our business.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Responsible for Citi’s payment product solutions across Europe, Middle East and Africa, Ebru Pakcan provides her insight into the challenges facing customers in the payments space today. We also discuss the impact of SEPA, evolution of cross-border payments and trends of innovative technology impacting the life of the corporate treasurer.</p>

<h5 class="title">EMEA Head of Payments for Treasury and Trade Solutions</h5>
<img alt="Citi logo" class="logo" height="29" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/citi-logo-2010-50x29.png" title="Citi" width="50"/>
<p>Prior to her current role as EMEA Head of Payments for Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS), Ebru Pakcan had been responsible for the TTS EMEA Product Implementation team since May 2004. Before moving to the UK, Ebru was Citi’s Securities Country Manager in Turkey, managing the custody and clearing business and operations for two and a half years. Ebru joined Citibank Turkey in 1997 as a Project Manager in the Technology department and later expanded her Operation and Technology division responsibilities in various management positions.</p>
<p>Ebru holds a degree in Computer Engineering from Bogazici University in Istanbul, Turkey.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="why-are-payments-still-such-a-challenge-when-the-processes-involved-are-essentially-quite-basic">Why are payments still such a challenge when the processes involved are essentially quite basic?</h5>
<p>Firstly, the basic activity of moving funds from one location to another, whether through account-based electronic solutions or cheques, still involves time and cost. In addition, there is inevitably a question surrounding the information requirements for that payment. This may involve local regulations, tax implications, or simply additional information needs that stem from the beneficiary’s or remitter’s business. As such, the activity surrounding the payment, in addition to the movement of the physical funds, must tick a number of boxes.</p>
<p>As globalisation continues, some of the payments which used to be more traditional, that is the domestic payments, have become increasingly cross-border. A decade ago we would have seen cross-border payments happening within Europe for instance but payments from Europe to the Middle East, Europe to Asia or vice versa, were certainly not so common. In Europe we have seen the introduction of SEPA to beat the complexities of cross-border flows, but what about Asia and Africa?</p>
<p>Cross-border payments in these regions involve more and more currencies as a result of the increasing commercial flows to and from developing countries and very diverse and prolific regulations. Therefore the payments landscape continues to be a complex ecosystem with growing challenges, but equally rewarding opportunities for efficiency. It is not simply a question of technology automation and faster and cheaper clearing infrastructures as these do not fully address the problem.</p>
<h5 id="is-sepa-really-making-a-difference-yet">Is SEPA really making a difference yet?</h5>
<p>In the marketplace there is a great deal of talk as to whether SEPA has been successful. Is it achieving everything it was designed to achieve? Where are we now? What is the adoption rate? These are the questions everyone is asking us.</p>
<p>Let me begin by providing some context. Citi is one of the biggest advocates of SEPA and has been for many years. One of the key reasons for our support is that SEPA is trying to achieve the environment that we have been striving to create for our global and multinational clients for over a decade. From talking to our clients we understand that one of the most important things that cash flow managers and treasurers are trying to achieve is consistency leading to efficiencies – whether consistency of payment requirements, payment rules, clearing cycle times or consistency of pricing.</p>
<p>Citi was essentially successful in setting up this environment for its clients by providing a single interface to customers, standardised formats and standardised information. There were of course diversities in the markets in which we operated: differences in the clearing cycles between Germany and Italy for instance. So for us, SEPA was exactly what we needed to be able to take that consistency to the next level for our customers.</p>
<p>In that context, with the capabilities SEPA currently has, it has achieved the basic requirements of this need for consistency. What it perhaps hasn’t achieved yet is overcoming all the quirks of the individual local markets for every payment type.</p>
<h5 id="does-this-mean-corporates-aren’t-finding-sepa-that-useful">Does this mean corporates aren’t finding SEPA that useful?</h5>
<p>If I am a treasurer thinking about converting my payment flows, I still have to think about the payments I will be able to successfully convert to SEPA, and which payments I will have to keep in the old world of local ACH solutions.</p>
<p>Having said that, in the last three to six months, we have started to see much greater interest in exploring SEPA and we are talking to our clients about converting their flows sooner rather than later. I don’t think there will be perfect time for converting as such, unless there is a deadline or a milestone which will drive corporates forward.</p>
<p>The payments industry as a whole has to stop seeing SEPA as a market initiative imposed by policy makers, or an optional off-the-shelf payment type. We have to embrace whatever efficiencies SEPA is already capable of delivering, and start making maximum use of it. This way of thinking is starting to resonate much more with the corporates, and everybody is looking for additional efficiencies wherever they may be able to find them.</p>
<p>For corporates, this might mean the opportunity to lose a number of accounts that they are holding in different markets, or to know exactly what cycle time they can expect when they are making their payments. Ultimately, this means better managing the entire cash flow cycle.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-your-outlook-for-sepa-this-year">What is your outlook for SEPA this year?</h5>
<p>2010 is certainly going to be a year when we will see more interest in SEPA than in previous years, but I do not believe that the conversion rate will have increased dramatically by year-end. I am however quite hopeful that this year is going to be the year when corporates start putting SEPA into their two to three year plans around what they are doing with their ERP systems.</p>
<p>We do have a number of clients with sizeable volumes already converted. Many of them took the opportunity of the ongoing projects that they already had, whether it was an ERP implementation, or a new technology adoption such as XML, and built the migration to SEPA into their project. In many instances the feedback we are getting form our clients is that SEPA has in fact turned out to be more worthwhile than initially thought it would be. So when they are approached by another corporate and asked why they chose to convert, their answer is, ‘Why not?’ For us, this is a key message going forward.</p>
<h5 id="what-can-be-done-to-optimise-cross-border-payments-outside-of-europe">What can be done to optimise cross-border payments outside of Europe?</h5>
<p>We recently conducted a survey across our client base to determine how companies were dealing with their cross-border payment needs. Interestingly, the results of the survey showed that a large proportion of our clients are keeping local accounts open in many markets, just so that they can manage their cross-border payments. Some particularly tricky currencies were highlighted by the results, such as the Korean won, and the Russian rouble. The commercial and trade flows of these currencies are becoming increasingly important, but the regulations around these flows are making it difficult for corporates to deal with them. This is an area where we have been able to bring our global footprint and local expertise to offer non-account based solutions to corporates. This could potentially mean using a single account structure to make payments in over 100 different currencies.</p>
<p>The cross-border payments space is an area where corporates need to think much more broadly about all the flows involved. Many treasuries, while establishing payment factories, will consider their large cross-border flows such as supplier payments and in-country payroll but will forget the seemingly less significant flows such as payments to expat personnel. Similarly, many corporates have substantial payment flows not directly owned or managed by the Treasury – such as dividends and employee stock plans. There are some interesting solutions available for all sizes of flows and corporates should embrace more creative solutions to enable these flows to be better structured and managed.</p>
<p>One such example is related to corporates with accelerated growth agendas through multi-national acquisitions and/or aggressive expansion plans organically. Typically, these companies are challenged with setting up complex account structures in multiple markets over a short period of time. Moreover, headquarters have the dilemma of centralised controls and oversight versus local authority. A payments solution, requiring only a single funding account, capable of meeting payment needs in multiple markets, while allowing flexibility with the company’s operational structure may be best placed to overcome this challenge. At Citi, we help by structuring solutions to such complex needs.</p>
<h5 id="how-has-technology-facilitated-developments-in-payments">How has technology facilitated developments in payments?</h5>
<p>Technology is certainly a very important enabler for payments. The question here really is how to make best use of the technology as an enabler? Corporates may fall into the trap of trying to adopt new technology as soon as it comes to market but fundamentally a payment is still a payment. So how can we make sure that we can use the technology in a way to help our clients improve their end-to-end payment processes and generate efficiencies?</p>
<p>There are some conflicting priorities across the industry on how to use technology and the XML ISO 20022 format for instance. There are still some banks that believe that proprietary solutions are something that they need to have in order to be able to retain their client base. Citi promotes an unbiased vision, we want to make it easier for clients to work with banks and to allow differentiation of banks at the overall service offering level. We are, therefore, supportive of the bank agnostic model and we have pioneered as much as we can through industry boards and working groups, in conjunction with our clients and SWIFT, to really make things happen.</p>
<p>It has been a real learning experience for us, in some instances working with competitor banks to help the customer to reach their goal. In the EMEA region we have over 20 customers who have adopted the ISO 20022 format across their operations. Combined with the SEPA solution, the standard really allows corporates to get more mileage out of centralisation programmes.</p>
<p>Technology also has an important role to play at the more fundamental level of improving efficiency for sending payments and receiving return files regarding the status of payments. One particular area where we are seeing a great deal of potential for improvement is straight through reconciliation (STR). This involves not only outgoing payments related return information, but of course the corporate’s incoming payment flows as well. It really revolves around the power of information, allowing auto-reconciliation of account statements and all the information that banks return back to a corporate.</p>
<p>Traditionally, straight through processing (STP) has been a common measure of efficiency for payment factories and SSCs. STR is now emerging as the new measure of operational and financial efficiencies. What corporates are now coming to understand is that the information they need is increasingly more accessible and at a higher quality – thanks to the evolution of information technology and advancements of clearing infrastructures in many markets.</p>
<p>Many clearing houses provide information to the banks but the challenge is getting this integrated into the client’s ERP system. Citi has invested in tools and techniques to achieve such levels of integration and actively works with clients on adopting these tools. Then we can look at what kind of next level centralisation or even cost reduction they are able to achieve simply from the improvement of the manual reconciliation process.</p>
<h5 id="why-has-str-not-been-looked-into-before">Why has STR not been looked into before?</h5>
<p>Really, it is just a matter of priorities. Before now, the whole payment instruction side of things stood out as the area that could serve up immediate efficiencies. The advancements in the information technology space, enhancements to SWIFT and availability of higher quality information being passed on by clearing systems, have greatly increased the opportunities with further efficiencies in the downstream processes. Now people are going down in the food chain, looking at the next layer of what can be done.</p>
<p>Corporates digging deeper to find efficiencies across the business is a strong trend that we are seeing at the moment.</p>
<h5 id="how-will-this-affect-corporate-strategy-in-2010">How will this affect corporate strategy in 2010?</h5>
<p>Essentially, this means that it is time to start looking beyond payments as a transaction and to focus on what are known as adjacent processes. These are the business workflows that actually result in a payment being made. Supplier payments are a good example. These payments are the result of the procurement cycle, which involves the adjacent processes of invoicing, billing and so on. Other adjacent processes may include supplier financing or discounting opportunities.</p>
<p>The efficiencies that can be gained by looking at these processes under the same umbrella will of course vary from company to company. Citi aims to open the door to these efficiencies in 2010 by having an open dialogue with our clients, and offering end-to-end solutions.</p></div>

<p>Having joined J.P. Morgan in 1984, Ms McLaughlin-Moore lived abroad for eight years in the 1990s, moving back to Hong Kong in 2007. Linda resides in Hong Kong with her husband and daughter.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="how-has-the-financial-crisis-affected-the-payments-industry">How has the financial crisis affected the payments industry?</h5>
<p>The market turmoil has eroded basic levels of trust in those at the heart of the payments industry, ie financial services institutions and, essentially, the banking system as a whole. This loss of faith has however prompted those within the financial services industry to revisit their existing procedures and identify areas in which they can improve their business practices.</p>
<p>Let us take the manufacturing industry by way of an example. From the sudden onset of the crisis, manufacturers have quickly had to review their inefficient processes and find ways to unlock trapped cash from within the company. That is to say, they have been forced to come out of their comfort zones, improve their inventory management and face the reality that for some time to come, levels of demand may be significantly lower than before. Although this may seem in part to be a negative step, it is in fact a positive opportunity to transform the company’s processes.</p>
<p>As banks, we need to look at our industry this way as well. For those bankers who are in emerging payments markets, like China, such an event can fuel a significant amount of growth and investment in core banking technology, which can catapult their organisations into the competitive field. These types of shifts and investments are more difficult in countries where there is a significant amount of legacy structures.</p>
<p>The crisis should be seen as a call to action for the payments industry – growth in payments should not be seen as less of a priority because of the crisis. Industry players should seek to align their value proposition with the new client requirements and demands that have come out of the crisis. As a starting point, we – and by this I mean the industry players – need to build on and renew our existing capabilities and strengths.</p>
<p>The industry needs to adopt a ‘back-to-basics’ approach and focus on the core values and principles that we offer to our corporate clients. It is a question of building on those foundations to make a stable, reliable and, of course, trustworthy basis on which to deal with our customers. In order to get back to the root of the business, we – like the manufacturers I mentioned – need to thoroughly review our basic processes. We need to understand what it is that clients want and determine how best to deliver the value that they expect. The first thing to do here is to understand how clients’ needs have changed with the market disruption.</p>
<h5 id="can-we-start-by-looking-at-how-clients-requirements-had-evolved-pre-crisis">Can we start by looking at how clients’ requirements had evolved pre-crisis?</h5>
<p>Some of the pre-crisis drivers are of course still present, but understanding the emerging trends in the payments industry before the financial crisis is a useful step in adopting a back-to-basics approach. Pre-crisis, there was very much a trend towards solutions that were ‘faster, better, cheaper,’ especially with the evolving role of technology in the industry. But what is really meant by this?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Faster.</h5>
<p>Before the crisis, corporates saw the bounds of treasury technology being pushed further and further. They began to require their banks to offer real-time processing and wireless communication to enable ‘anytime, anywhere’ banking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Better.</h5>
<p>As clients’ activities became increasingly global, their processes had a tendency to become more complicated, with variations in regional formats and legacy practices. As such, clients turned to bank solutions – and again, technology – to provide a flexible and agile treasury structure where straight through processing (STP) was a must. Achieving centralised visibility and control was a top priority, regardless of treasury structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Cheaper.</h5>
<p>If processes are STP, this means they are more efficient – therefore, pre-crisis, clients began to expect costs to be integrated, and scaled down appropriately. In addition, clients looked increasingly for value added services to distinguish between their banking partners and to achieve more value at less cost.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="and-how-has-the-financial-crisis-impacted-on-these-requirements">And how has the financial crisis impacted on these requirements?</h5>
<p>I believe it is true to say that clients have also been adopting a back-to-basics approach, meaning that their priorities have changed. Core activities have become ‘interesting’ again as that is where the lifeblood of the business is – ie the cash. There are four main trends to discuss here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Treasury under the spotlight.</h5>
<p>The financial crisis has put corporate treasury at centre stage, underscoring the importance of liquidity and risk management – core elements of treasury’s mandate to safeguard financial assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Working capital optimisation.</h5>
<p>Freeing up trapped cash internally has become a first line of defence against reduced bank lending and lower consumer demand. Treasury has positioned itself as a strategic business partner through driving working capital efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Transparency.</h5>
<p>Achieving a holistic overview of the physical and financial supply chains is a growing priority for treasurers with the aim of achieving greater transparency of cash flows in order to optimise working capital. In addition, transparency has also become key in banking relationships as counterparty risk has become an increased threat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Paying for value.</h5>
<p>In a turnaround from the pre-crisis situation, corporates have shown increased interest in paid-for bank services, particularly those that offer optimisation of liquidity and working capital within a transparent and risk-managed environment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="in-what-ways-can-banks-respond-to-these-new-demands">In what ways can banks respond to these new demands?</h5>
<p>Sticking with the approach of revisiting fundamentals, the primary move is for banks to redefine what actually constitutes a payment. By this I mean that we need to forget the bank jargon and adopt a client-centric view of the payments process and industry as a whole. Placing payments into the two bank categories of ‘treasury’ and ‘commercial’ can be counterproductive, limiting the scope of what payments include.</p>
<p>After all, payments have always been, and will continue to be, a commodity. For clients, payments are not standalone, as they are to a bank – they are an integral part of the business and its wider commercial processes. It is important that banks begin to appreciate the broader payments context.</p>
<p>There are a number of client ‘layers’ to a payment that banks have not necessarily paid sufficient attention to as yet. These include remittance detail, the cash conversion cycle and value added information. Increasingly, banks need to think outside of the box, and recognise that clients do in fact use more than one bank. This means building in multi-bank functionality where appropriate and offering format conversion services.</p>
<p>Banks also need to consider taking a much more active role in their client’s business – taking on the processes surrounding the payment, for example. Such processes may include intelligent routing (selecting the appropriate channel for the payment) and fraud detection. The integration of payments more fully into the cash conversion cycle is also something that banks need to look at more closely with their customers as this would increase STP rates, thereby boosting efficiency and improving control for both parties.</p>
<p>A final point to add is that the information that a bank holds can be crucial to a corporate. Why not provide bank analysis of payment information, for example? This would allow corporates to move towards achieving their aims of working capital optimisation (by identifying trends) and of improving transparency (by supplying an overview of goods, money and information).</p>
<h5 id="to-what-extent-is-this-achievable">To what extent is this achievable?</h5>
<p>As a single bank player in the market, it is difficult to say; but as a combined force, it is definitely possible. Banks should be looking to leverage shared-industry utilities to solve collective industry challenges and address client priorities.</p>
<p>For instance, individual institutions of course have their role to play in payments fraud, and must ensure that they are vigilant, running employee training schemes and communicating internally, for example. However, the true fight against fraud should take place at a more macro level – the industry must build new anti-fraud capabilities with cross-jurisdictional functionality. It truly is a collaborative approach that is required.</p>
<h5 id="so-do-you-think-banks-will-be-forming-more-partnerships-going-forward">So do you think banks will be forming more partnerships going forward?</h5>
<p>We will probably see less of the traditional correspondent networks going forward as these are usually based on historical relationships that are not necessarily as strategically advantageous as they have the potential to be. They will be replaced by collaborative networks – or strategic partnerships – whereby there will be fewer actual relationships as such, but they will run deeper and will have a more strategic focus towards meeting clients’ needs.</p>
<p>In China, we believe that it is very important for foreign banks to have strong partnerships with local banks. While foreign banks can leverage their customer relationships and robust global systems, no foreign bank will ever have the local coverage that a Chinese bank has. We think that it is critical to have broad and deep relationships with other banks.</p>
<p>As we are expanding our footprint in China and our in-country capabilities, we will continue to work closely with Chinese banks to meet all of our clients’ needs.</p>
<h5 id="could-you-provide-an-example-of-this-type-of-collaboration">Could you provide an example of this type of collaboration?</h5>
<p>In order to make their payment processes more efficient, companies in the Asia-Pacific region have begun looking to new technologies to reduce paper in the payments workflow. Such companies have found that a convenient alternative to foreign currency and travellers’ cheques for employees is prepaid cards. These cards, which only allow employees to access pre-loaded funds and do not offer a credit line, provide additional efficiencies by automating the reimbursement process for travel and entertainment expenses, for example.</p>
<p>In response, J.P. Morgan deployed a prepaid travel card programme last year to several of our Financial Institution clients in South Asia. This solution assists these Financial Institution clients to deploy our capability and offer pre-paid card programmes to their customers. This programme enables clients to migrate from paper to electronics, as well as enhancing their operating environment through automated reporting and reconciliation tools. Both banks and their clients benefit from this type of solution as they can both save on processing costs and boost their respective efficiencies.</p>
<p>Banks are leveraging each others’ capabilities more and more these days. In a co-operative manner, it enables each of the banking partners to expand their capabilities while focusing their investment dollars on where they have strength.</p>
<h5 id="what-do-you-predict-for-the-payments-industry-over-the-next-12-months">What do you predict for the payments industry over the next 12 months?</h5>
<p>Given all that we have discussed, I would hope to see the global payments market becoming more integrated and moving closer to addressing the needs of clients, be this in terms of risk management, transparency, efficiency or liquidity.</p>
<p>While I believe this evolution can be pushed forward by industry participants, the regulators will also have their role to play. The development of standards, such as ISO 20022 for example, will serve to enhance this integration and interoperability within the payments arena. The key message for banks is to revisit their clients’ priorities and to respond to these with a value proposition. The key for corporates is to communicate openly with their banking partners.</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p>This month we talk to Mikael Björknert about the challenges presented to corporates by today’s turbulent markets and how these can be overcome. We discuss strategies for the cross-cultural exchange of knowledge, talk about the challenge of bringing corporates and banks onto the same page and consider whether green initiatives are a thing of the past.</p>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Mikael Björknert</h4>
<h5 class="title">Head of Global Transaction Services</h5>
<img alt="SEB logo" class="logo" height="25" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/seb-logo-2009-55x25.png" title="SEB" width="55"/>
<p>Since October 2006, Mikael has been manager of Global Transaction Services (GTS) within Merchant Banking, SEB. The business area comprises Cash Management, Trade Finance, Custody Services, Fund Services and Leasing and Factoring for large corporates, mid-sized corporates and financial institutions and has 900 employees. Previously Mikael has held the global managerial positions for Securities Services (2003-2006) as well as Commercial Banking/Cash Management within SEB (1999-2003). In these positions Mikael also had responsibility for the operations side, which is being centralised into Group Operations within SEB.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="how-are-they-responding-to-them">What are corporates’ main concerns today and how are they responding to them?</h5>
<p>The most pressing and most obvious concern for corporates right now is lowering their general cost level, say of administration or production, to meet new lower sales levels due to the crisis. Corporates are also trying to maintain a healthy and sustainable size and quality of balance sheet, ie focusing on liquidity/cash flow and risk management to minimise short-term dependence on the capital/funding market. For every company, each of these main concerns can be broken down into several different subsets depending on how hard the company has been hit.</p>
<p>As for how corporates are responding to these concerns, I think it’s now clearly visible, of course to different extents, that corporates themselves lack a holistic overview and are not strong enough to reshape their processes and governance models in relation to process efficiency, risk and working capital management. After all, this really is what they should be doing in order to come out stronger when the economic turnaround starts.</p>
<p>This lack of foresight and understanding, with regard to the full integration and optimisation of the financial supply chain towards the physical, limits corporates’ ability to enhance their sustainable competitive strength. So much effort is being put in to ad hoc cost cutting initiatives that companies are simply fire fighting the current challenges without looking forward to tomorrow’s opportunities.</p>
<h5 id="what-do-you-think-companies-should-do-to-become-more-long-term-focused">So what’s the answer? What do you think companies should do to become more long-term focused?</h5>
<p>Honestly, it is tough for a banker to understand fully the different prerequisites when giving general advice to corporates. However, at SEB we believe it would be extremely beneficial for corporates to have a broader understanding of the correlation between the physical and financial supply chains. This means increased communication, cross-collaboration and alignment based on the overall objective to enhance processes.</p>
<p>To get people understanding the value of aligning the physical and financial supply chains, you need to gather people from each function in the same room and dispense with the jargon. When companies do that, I believe that they can discover ways of substantially improving the cash flow and managing aggregated cost reductions, but importantly, with both sides present they can also get a clearer picture of any potential risks.</p>
<p>The world out there is more uncertain than that which companies had become used to; therefore attitudes to risk also need to change. A corporate must be comfortable with its counterparty, in the sense that they should have a long-term, secure and stable relationship. However, with the crisis it’s more difficult to have control over a counterparty – for example, a supplier’s bank credit line could be withdrawn within 24 hours if their bank has problems. Also, the political risk is quite difficult to monitor if it includes many different markets.</p>
<h5 id="whats-the-easiest-way-to-go-about-reassessing-your-risk">What’s the easiest way to go about reassessing your risk?</h5>
<p>On paper, the easiest option for a corporate is probably to move out from businesses with higher risk levels, thereby ensuring that the cash flow and balance sheet remain stable and healthy. However, that is also taking a black and white view of the world and of course not a viable alternative. In reality, it is totally the opposite: corporates must climb the risk ladder even further to be able to win contracts and to secure a healthy supplier base. Consequently there is increased pressure on corporates’ liquidity base and balance sheet.</p>
<p>This is an extremely important balancing act, and there is an increased demand on corporates to use their balance sheet and liquidity position for sales support financing, in the form of extended payment terms or vendor financing arrangements – it’s not an option to pull out of such risks altogether. The important factor to consider here is knowledge transfer, which puts new demands on everyone to contribute, from treasury, sales and marketing to procurement and logistics.</p>
<p>There needs to be a cross-cultural exchange of knowledge, and I think that is applicable not only within the company, but also between the company and those who provide some of these liquidity management and risk solutions – such as the banks. As an example, the terminology and focuses in the working capital area are quite different in finance and purchasing departments – especially in banks – even though the different angles of working capital are all very much related.</p>
<p>I would say that the banks need to improve in this area as well. In general, banks have a tendency to look at each area separately instead of looking into the full value of the integrated supply chain. For example, in order to be capable of taking a holistic view towards their clients, banks should let go of their internal product area borders, which present limitations.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-seb-doing-at-the-moment">What is SEB doing at the moment?</h5>
<p>Within Global Transaction Services (GTS) we have now gathered together all the necessary business areas – cash management, trade finance, leasing, factoring and supply chain. We create teams that sit together and we try to get the team to act not only from a cash, trade or supply chain perspective, but from a holistic value chain angle.</p>
<p>SEB has an advisory approach where the client’s financial supply chain is reviewed alongside the physical chain. This can be further developed using the SEB Corporate Value ChainTM methodology as a starting point. SEB’s role is to identify areas for improvement in processes that contribute to liquidity optimisation and risk management, prioritise activities that will deliver the greatest value and deliver concrete solutions to the challenges corporates are facing today.</p>
<p>SEB’s Corporate Value ChainTM approach has been very successful in that those we are helping are extremely satisfied. On the other hand, it is a slower process as we work one-on-one with our customers. I don’t think that many other banks are actually equipped for working like this with every customer on a large scale.</p>
<h5 id="can-we-talk-about-how-working-capital-management-has-changed-with-the-financial-crisis">Can we talk about how working capital management has changed with the financial crisis?</h5>
<p>Firstly, there’s a greater general awareness among corporates. I think that working capital has become so important that corporates are strengthening their relationships with select counterparties. When they do that, they get more out of the partnership instead of buying piece by piece services.</p>
<p>That has certainly been a very strong trend in the financial crisis, together with the increased usage of specific instruments like factoring, different types of insurance solutions or trade finance arrangements. For corporates, the most important thing right now is securing working capital – not reviewing how the capital ‘works’ as such.</p>
<p>I believe that working capital will become tighter still – even if everybody is talking about a turnaround at the end of this year or the beginning of next year, that is still a turnaround from extremely low levels. So I believe that working capital – and helping the corporate to get enough working capital – will be the number one question over the next year, all because of the crisis.</p>
<h5 id="how-have-customer-relationships-changed-with-the-economic-turmoil">How have customer relationships changed with the economic turmoil?</h5>
<p>SEB already had a strong position in the Nordic area but this has in fact strengthened significantly since the financial crisis. This strengthening is due to the fact that most large international banks have disappeared from the area, choosing to focus on their core markets.</p>
<p>This has been very beneficial for SEB and I would say that we have probably never had such a strong position among the large corporate segment as we have right now. Indeed, we have never had such high earnings from this segment as we have at the moment. So we are making the best of the situation.</p>
<p>However, it is not without challenges for SEB to cover the gap left by the international banks. As such, SEB and GTS have had to focus even harder on advising clients on working capital measures in order to recycle their liquidity more efficiently, thereby reducing the funding demands on SEB from the corporates.</p>
<h5 id="have-green-policies-moved-off-the-agenda">Staying with the financial crisis, have green policies moved off the agenda?</h5>
<p>No, not at all. Aside from the human aspect of the ethical approach – that we should be greener – there are also economical views on this. What we see is that quite a lot of companies now require green investments under their investment policies. In fact, at SEB we believe that the next investment boom may well involve types of green investment. As a bank, we are preparing to be the counterparty of choice in that area – corporates want to have a counterparty that takes the environment seriously and has a truly green approach.</p>
<p>This means adjusting products and services, as well as demonstrating commitment to the market. Green policies are very high on the SEB agenda, and we actually gathered around 120 key stakeholders in Sweden at a three-day conference here in June to discuss our green product portfolio and approach. We have just issued the first green bond in conjunction with the World Bank and this has been a great success.</p>
<p>We also have green offerings in the private individual space – for instance, if you want to get a car loan and you buy a car that is deemed to be ‘environmental’, you receive lower interest rates on that loan. Although we are very keen on the green offering, we also realise that this movement may take many years to come to fruition.</p>
<h5 id="how-is-the-banking-landscape-in-europe-changing">How is the banking landscape in Europe changing?</h5>
<p>Of course the European Commission’s Financial Services Action Plan is extremely important for Europe, with the main initiatives there being MiFID and SEPA. However, what we have seen so far is larger changes in the securities market through MiFID than changes through SEPA in the payments market.</p>
<p>In the securities market you have the stock exchanges and the new multilateral trading facilities (MTFs) and central counterparty clearing houses (CCPs) that are causing many ripples on the surface of the banking pond. Meanwhile, SEPA is a little bit slower – I think there still is some resistance among the banks and this will only get tougher when the PSD comes into full force.</p>
<p>In the Nordic area, the Finnish corporates are moving strongly into SEPA, starting to buy SEPA services, adjusting their accounts payable, accounts receivable and so on to SEPA payments – they are moving to the standardised world. Here we will see the first test for banks – can they adjust to the new environment? Can they transform themselves to voluntarily reduce income from standard services and expand their value-added services quickly enough to regain some of the income tap?</p>
<h5 id="what-do-you-think-is-the-way-forward">What do you think is the way forward?</h5>
<p>The way forward is that the banks need to start coming up with value added services so that both parties can get the standardised low cost payment flow that they need and at the same time not get rid of all the benefits they have built up in the old payment system. At SEB we are very pro-SEPA and at the forefront of adapting to the new SEPA environment for real. We believe in combining a basic SEPA offering with a holistic approach like SEB’s Corporate Value ChainTM to help clients improve their working capital position and financial supply chain, in turn adding the extra value that the clients will appreciate.</p>
<h5 id="how-else-has-seb-been-differentiating-itself">How else has SEB been differentiating itself?</h5>
<p>Right now we have a tier one capital ratio of 13.1% and that is the highest in Europe, setting us in a front position. What we are doing is concentrating very much on our existing clients and trying to get them through the cycle. We save capital when times are tough and at other times we use the capital for expanding.</p>
<h5 id="are-there-plans-for-expansion-on-the-horizon">Are there plans for expansion on the horizon?</h5>
<p>As I mentioned, there is an expansion towards the Nordic large corporate sector whereby we we want to strengthen relations with these corporates, as well as with financial institutions. On the products side, we are taking our existing products and combining them into tools – it’s more a way of thinking than a completely new product set.</p>
<h5 id="what-challenges-do-you-think-will-arise-over-the-next-12-months">What challenges do you think will arise over the next 12 months?</h5>
<p>I think that most corporates and banks will probably be challenged by the public – some believe there will be a quick economic turnaround, others believe it will take longer but everyone wants a prediction. I think these conditions will turn business back into a strategic game. In times of improved earnings it is very easy to stick to what is profitable or what is safe. Now, people may dare to do things that they haven’t done before – or maybe they will do them because they have to. Some companies will not necessarily have the luxury of choice.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>We talk to Steve Pateman about Santander’s acquisitions of Abbey, Alliance &amp; Leicester and Bradford &amp; Bingley in the UK and discuss how Santander has responded to the challenges and opportunities brought by the financial crisis. We also explore the concept of relationship banking and the importance of trust in customer/bank relationships.</p>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Steve Pateman</h4>
<h5 class="title">Head of UK Corporate &amp; Commercial Banking</h5>
<img alt="Santander Corporate Banking logo" class="logo" height="40" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/santander-corporate-banking-logo-100x40.png" title="Santander Corporate Banking" width="100"/>
<p>Steve Pateman is Head of UK Corporate &amp; Commercial Banking for Santander Corporate Banking. He has been involved in investment, corporate, commercial and business banking for over 25 years. Steve previously worked for NatWest and RBS where he was CEO of Business Banking, Managing Director (Commercial Banking) and Managing Director (Corporate Banking). Steve has also worked on a variety of financings, restructurings, capital market and equity issues. He has experience of running businesses with profit and loss in excess of £1 billion with over 5,000 staff.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="could-you-give-me-an-overview-of-the-santander-group-and-its-banking-strategy">Could you give me an overview of the Santander Group and its banking strategy?</h5>
<p>Santander is one of the top ten of the world’s best capitalised banks. Our core businesses are in Iberia, UK and America. In the UK we acquired Abbey in 2004, and Alliance &amp; Leicester and Bradford &amp; Bingley in 2008. Across Spain, Brazil and the UK we have approximately 60% of the group’s businesses. We also acquired Sovereign in the US last year.</p>
<p>Santander is focused on retail and commercial banking. It has a significant corporate banking business, and a very strong global markets business, but at its heart, it is a retail and commercial bank. Acquiring Abbey was really about extending the successful retail and commercial business that Santander had in Iberia into the UK.</p>
<h5 id="what-has-been-your-strategy-with-abbey-and-the-other-uk-acquisitions">What has been your strategy with Abbey and the other UK acquisitions?</h5>
<p>In 2004, Abbey was a bank in probably not the best of shapes. It had a significant portfolio of under-performing wholesale assets but was very much the old building society business focused around savings and mortgages. The original focus of Santander was tidying up that business and putting it on a very sound platform. The strategy really started to come through in Abbey’s performance in 2007 and 2008.</p>
<p>When Abbey was acquired by Santander, its cost/income ratio was roughly 70% and last year it was close to 40%, which gives you an idea of the efficiencies we put in place. We installed the Partenon system, Santander’s main operating system, which allows staff to see everything customers do with the bank and process requirements on-line.</p>
<p>Santander’s attention in the UK turned to corporate and commercial aspirations towards the end of 2007. The strategy was to diversify away from larger corporate transactions into a more distributed corporate and commercial banking business that effectively picked up the UK mid-market – where we could be a more meaningful banking partner. We wanted to continue building on Abbey’s real estate and social housing businesses, but also to create a regional business footprint.</p>
<p>Acquiring Alliance &amp; Leicester last year allowed us to accelerate our plans by two to three years as Alliance &amp; Leicester already had a regional business network. What that acquisition gave us was the infrastructure to start to compete with other UK banks.</p>
<p>Our focus then was on what we thought customers really wanted, which was to have a relationship with their bank where their bank understands them, works with them, maintains a consistent level of support and can be relied upon. We focused on building relationships with businesses rather than trying to work out how many products we could sell them. Our stance was to have a much more old fashioned approach to relationship banking.</p>
<p>What has happened over the last 18 months has created a real opportunity to do that. The market wants an alternative to what it has seen over the last 10-15 years and is increasingly comfortable and indeed keen on the dual banking model. That sits well with us because in Spain, even the smallest business will have two or three banking relationships – that is the culture and the environment. In the UK we are now seeing a trend towards companies wanting to have two or three banking relationships so that they are not dependant on one particular organisation.</p>
<h5 id="how-well-positioned-was-santander-to-withstand-the-financial-crisis">How well positioned was Santander to withstand the financial crisis?</h5>
<p>Santander is regulated by the Bank of Spain, which has taken a more conservative view in the way it regulates its banks. In the good times, Spanish banks set aside more than their UK counterparts which meant that when the bad times came, they had very good reserves that they could draw on. Santander has got a very strong balance sheet, which was strengthened by the rights issue last year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In the good times, Spanish banks set aside more than their UK counterparts which meant that when the bad times came, they had very good reserves that they could draw on.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our philosophy is about building relationships with clients and taking sensible risks. This is not about going out and generating as much income as you can and then living with the consequences. This is about generating quality, sustainable revenue from relationships. At Santander, we do not talk about deals – we talk about relationships. Transactions are part of the relationship; they are not done in isolation.</p>
<h5 id="what-challenges-and-opportunities-has-the-crisis-brought-for-corporate-banking-and-santander-in-particular">What challenges and opportunities has the crisis brought for corporate banking and Santander in particular?</h5>
<p>A decent sized corporate in the UK traditionally had access to 15 or 20 banks, which is now down to six or seven due to the recent consolidation in the market. Consequently, there is a need to rethink how you manage those banking relationships and effectively, what your capital structure is. There is money out there, but not as much of it. Instead of supply outstripping demand by a multiple, as it did before the crisis when UK corporates had access to a wall of cash, supply and demand are not far off achieving a balance. That changes the whole dynamics of the market.</p>
<p>When the supply of credit outstrips demand and the price goes down to a point where it is uneconomic, what happens is what we have seen – banks end up being unable to build the level of reserves and capital that are needed to sustain their businesses for a down cycle and they have to react in a very volatile way, by pulling credit and pulling capacity, which has a negative impact on the economy. You cannot have low pricing and low volatility – if you get low pricing, you are going to have high volatility at some point, so there is a trade-off between risk, return and volatility.</p>
<p>The sensible way to do business would be to balance risk, return and volatility. I think that many companies would much rather have a market where there was sensible pricing, sensible risk parameters and very low volatility so that they can plan and manage their businesses in a relatively safe environment. There is an opportunity to create an organisation which is competitive and sensible in terms of risk. It is entirely reasonable to say to a company, we are willing to invest capital in you but this is the basis on which we invest it.</p>

</blockquote>
<h5 id="what-are-the-implications-for-the-banking-industry">What is the importance of trust in the current market and what are the implications for the banking industry?</h5>
<p>A bank is presented with a business plan by a customer and has to decide if that is a plan it is prepared to back. That creates an element of trust between the bank and the customer. The customer trusts the bank to maintain its support and to work with the customer, should things not go according to plan, and the bank needs to trust the customer to do what he said he was going to do.</p>
<p>Trust is a fundamental part of a bank relationship. There needs to be communication, dialogue, understanding and a common sense of purpose about trying to work together. That has to be the successful foundation upon which the banking industry can build and go forward.</p>
<p>For instance, let’s say that a business which has done a good job, has been with a bank for a number of years and has always done what it said it would do, encounters a small problem. In the past that has been dealt with by a simple exchange of correspondence or dialogue but now it is seen as an opportunity to restructure the debt, often on draconian terms that can create a crisis. When that happens to you, or someone you know, then your trust in the banking industry breaks down. Trust must be rebuilt, otherwise it will be harder for businesses to make the investments and long-term commitment that they need to make. You cannot expect businesses to plan for the long term and employ people if they aren’t confident about their ability to fund that growth and investment.</p>
<h5 id="where-do-you-start-rebuilding-that-trust">Where do you start rebuilding that trust?</h5>
<p>Understand a customer’s business and from that you will be able to develop a relationship. Say to the customer, “Talk to me about your business and what you want to achieve.” That is a good starting point. If you go in and say, “This week’s special offer is one of these,” you are the same as everyone else.</p>
<p>We want to be different because we think it is fundamentally important to the business that we want to develop, in terms of being a long-term player that allows us to generate capital that we can reinvest. But if we don’t understand our customers and we don’t understand their businesses, we will fail in our aspirations.</p>
<h5 id="how-are-customers-needs-evolving-in-the-current-market">How are customers’ needs evolving in the current market?</h5>
<p>Customers are having to adapt to the fact that there is less banking capital and less liquidity out there. I spend a lot of time talking to treasurers who say that they have so many millions of pounds of debt and want to know what they should be doing about their capital and balance sheet. We talk to them about their indigenous UK business, which can probably sustain two to four banking relationships and raise a certain amount from the UK market. Then they can think about institutional investors, capital markets and other ways to bridge the gap.</p>
<p>Customers are saying they haven’t got enough business to keep 24 banks happy, only to keep six banks happy, and the gap will have to be filled from other sources. That is a trend that is very much going to continue. We will see a change in the way businesses are funded, a change in terms of leverage and price. We are probably in for a more conservative environment in terms of capital structures and I don’t think that is a bad thing. Customers are also focused on their suppliers and the question of how the suppliers are able to continue to sustain their businesses – much more so than in the past.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Customers are saying they haven’t got enough business to keep 24 banks happy, only to keep six banks happy, and the gap will have to be filled from other sources. That is a trend that is very much going to continue. We will see a change in the way businesses are funded, a change in terms of leverage and price.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="how-do-you-support-your-customers-in-the-long-term">How important are customer relationships and how do you support your customers in the long term?</h5>
<p>Relationship management is probably somewhat tarnished so when you start to talk about it, it is likely that people will raise an eyebrow. We have to be very clear that we practice what we preach, which is working with our customers to understand and develop their business and providing solutions that meet their needs.</p>
<p>That approach creates a much less volatile environment and a much less volatile banking relationship. It makes a better environment in which businesses can invest and grow and in which banks can prosper. We are seeking to develop long-term relationships, but you can only do that if you take the time to understand the customers and price capital in a way that reflects the fact that you are making an investment in their business.</p>
<p>If you get those fundamentals right, then you can have long-term relationship banking – but if you don’t get them right, we should tear up the words ‘relationship banking’ and accept that capital is a transactional commodity.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>This month we ask Clare Francis how the financial markets landscape has evolved in the past three years. We also discuss strategies for responding to the knock-on effects of the crisis in the next 12 months.</p>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Clare Francis</h4>
<h5 class="title">Head of Sales and Derivatives Structuring</h5>
<img alt="Lloyds TSB Corporate Markets logo" class="logo" height="15" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/lloyds-tsb-corporate-markets-logo-2010-187x15.png" title="Lloyds TSB Corporate Markets" width="187"/>
<p>Clare Francis joined Lloyds TSB Corporate Markets in 2006, having begun her career at RBS and moving to HSBC in 1998. Clare has held a variety of treasury and IT-related global positions in her career in the UK, Asia and the US.</p>
<p>Previous roles have included UK Head of Risk Management, Head of UK FX and Interest Rate Sales and Managing Director, Head of European Corporate team. Clare studied Business Management at London Business School, is a member of ACIB and is SFA qualified.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="how-things-have-changed-since-you-joined-the-bank-three-years-ago">Could you give me a brief overview of your role and how things have changed since you joined the bank three years ago?</h5>
<p>I’ve recently been appointed as Head of Sales and Derivatives Structuring at Lloyds TSB Corporate Markets. That appointment is a result of the integration of Bank of Scotland (BOS) Treasury Sales into the existing Lloyds Financial Markets Sales team. This integration was sparked by the merger with HBOS, which was approved in January this year.</p>
<p>With the merger, the scope of my role has grown. We now have a team of 300 client-facing people across the UK, US, continental Europe, Australia and the Middle East. This has developed from a base of 100. Our role continues to be to provide our clients with a service across research, risk management advisory, accounting, and liability management in the asset classes of rates, inflation, FX, emerging markets and commodities. We provide these services to many of Lloyds Banking Group’s clients, covering corporate, commercial, institutional and wealth (high net worth individuals).</p>
<p>Even before joining Lloyds TSB Corporate Markets, the team had been working hard, backed extensively by senior management, to improve our client service offering. As a result, we’ve been growing each part of the business to ensure the infrastructure, the sales coverage, the relationship management and the support teams provide seamless execution from front to back end.</p>
<p>For example, in the trading area we have brought in many senior figures in entirely new roles to build the exotic derivatives business – inflation, rates and FX. These positions, that didn’t exist in the business before, cover quantitative development, research and trading – so we are continuing to invest in developing our platform to support our clients’ changing needs despite the downturn.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-the-core-activities-of-lloyds-tsb-corporate-markets-sales-and-derivatives-structuring-business">What are the core activities of Lloyds TSB Corporate Markets Sales and Derivatives Structuring business?</h5>
<p> Our core activities are really threefold:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Working with customers to identify and evaluate financial risks to which they are exposed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing bespoke risk management solutions across the asset classes of interest rates, foreign exchange, commodities, inflation and emerging markets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specialising in a personal, customer-focused end-to-end consultative service backed by seamless execution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Backing that up we also have asset and liability management (ALM), economic research, IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) consultancy and a derivatives structuring team, which form our ‘trusted risk advisory’ proposition. This proposition is all about taking an integrated view of customers’ business, rather than a product-focused view, and supporting clients with increased value-added services.</p>
<p>And really the foundation of this is the fact that we are a relationship bank. Last month, Lloyds TSB Corporate Markets was crowned ‘Bank of the Year’ for the fifth year in a row in the Financial Director’s Excellence Awards. What’s key for us is that this is voted by customers – by over 550 UK Financial Directors.</p>
<h5 id="could-you-give-an-example-of-how-corporates-can-benefit-from-this-trusted-risk-advisory-approach">Could you give an example of how corporates can benefit from this ‘trusted risk advisory’ approach?</h5>
<p>To quote one of our clients, Gordon Hurst, Finance Director of Capita, “We believe this risk advisory proposition that Lloyds Corporate Markets continues to provide speaks volumes. The combination of experience on the risk management side, coupled with accounting and economic research, is undoubtedly a step forward. Getting two like-minded teams together, where we can both benefit, is crucial in these difficult times.”</p>
<p>As part of the service, we regularly visit clients and we seek to provide an integrated and comprehensive service. For example, we might have our FX advisors, our debt capital markets advisors and our interest rate advisors, together with research, accounting and structuring, all in a room for a brainstorming session with the client. In the last month this has ranged from a FTSE 100 telecoms company to a small private company in the North of England. Our ALM teams serve both our Corporate and Institutional sectors.</p>
<p>This is an interactive way of helping our clients work through their financial risk issues and it helps us understand our clients’ priorities. As well as streamlining the whole process, we find it really helps with idea generation and a two-way open dialogue that can exceed client expectations. However, there is always a lot of hard work on both sides getting to the point of trust where a bank is given the opportunity to prove delivery.</p>
<h5 id="which-activities-have-clients-been-most-interested-in-since-the-onset-of-the-financial-crisis">Which activities have clients been most interested in since the onset of the financial crisis?</h5>
<p>Within all client sectors, the whole concept of risk has taken on increased senior oversight, mainly as a result of the crisis. Early last year, Finance Directors getting involved in risk and liability management decisions was probably not heard of, but now these decisions are being taken at a senior level, to the extent that many senior figures are now actively involved in day-to-day transactional cash management decisions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Early last year, Finance Directors getting involved in risk and liability management decisions was probably not heard of, but now these decisions are being taken at a senior level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Foreign exchange volatility has been increasingly high over the last few months; sterling is getting some respite from the recent lows, but increased volatility has resulted in many questions from our clients.</p>
<p>In response to this, our trusted risk advisory approach has really borne fruit. Clients need a strong analytical framework to support the risk management activities they undertake. The development of our ‘Currency Ranker’ and ‘Traffic Light’ interest rate and FX research helps our clients explain volatility within a boardroom or treasury committee context, for instance.</p>
<p>In recent weeks we have also seen increased enquiries on inflation, and the fact that five-year swap rates have been falling recently has prompted treasurers to ask themselves – ‘is now the time to hedge?’</p>
<h5 id="what-differentiates-lloyds-tsb-corporate-markets-from-its-peers">What differentiates Lloyds TSB Corporate Markets from its peers?</h5>
<p>In a word: service. We are very aware there is much external competition and we need to work hard. We have brought in a lot of new, experienced people who all share the same vision, which is simply how do we continue to offer our clients a great risk management service in a rapidly changing market? For us this really encompasses the whole ‘trusted risk advisory’ approach.</p>
<p>We believe in listening to our clients and we implement enhancements to our services based on the feedback received in external surveys. We appreciate that in some cases we have further to go but the momentum we are building is impressive and we believe we have the best UK platform from which to leverage future growth.</p>
<p>We’re very proud of the feedback we have received in the FX space, for example. We achieved five top five positions in FX Week’s Best Bank Awards 2008, in categories including best bank for FX in London and best bank for spot FX. As well as moving up the ranks in FX Week, we have also seen that momentum has been reflected in other client surveys that we have been conducting.</p>
<p>Building and maintaining our client relationships is key for us, especially with the ongoing merger. Our relationships are core to our business and one of the biggest challenges that we have in putting together our new organisation is to take a mix of highly talented individuals, continue to invest in new talent and make sure that the integration is seamless in the eyes of our customers. That’s where we believe so many have failed, but for us it is our primary concern. We have to remain externally focused.</p>
<p>Our success, despite the market conditions, has come by not over-concentrating on any single client type, unlike some more traditional bank approaches.</p>
<p>With this approach, we can achieve very good scale as the products we deliver can be repackaged and rebranded across most of our client sets. In turn, this allows us to bring a very competitive product to market. For example, the portfolio optimisation models we have built across asset classes for the institutional arena equally help within wealth, and can also be used by our corporate clients looking for yield pick-up.</p>
<p>However, one of the most important points to make is that this model can only be successful if our clients trust us and are prepared to open up – our foundations are built on a long-term client relationship business and our relationship managers work alongside us to ensure we are not plugging square products into round holes.</p>
<h5 id="what-will-be-the-strategic-focus-over-the-next-12-months-or-so">What will be the strategic focus over the next 12 months or so?</h5>
<p>Obviously we have seen interest rates fall over the past year, and we are concerned about potential rising inflation. These are key risks in terms of assisting our clients throughout 2009 and into 2010. We also have a keen eye on equity and credit markets.</p>
<p>As such, we will be continuing to expand our inflation platform. We also believe that FX volatility will persist, and we will continue to invest significantly into our FX trading, research and exotic capabilities – for example, hiring key developers to support us in the extension of that platform. At the end of the day our role and strategic focus is to try and help our clients identify and manage risk.</p>
<p>Throughout the crisis we have seen clients drop their trading volumes over their e-platforms, preferring to turn back to the phones, but we are now seeing signs that this trend is reversing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Early last year, Finance Directors getting involved in risk and liability management decisions was probably not heard of, but now these decisions are being taken at a senior level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The delivery of our state-of-the-art e-platform, MarketsLink, has really allowed us to increase market share and penetration, which we foresee continuing in the coming months.</p>
<p>Coming to the table slightly later with the e-platform has meant that we’ve been able to implement a very up-to-date financial markets trading platform for both our foreign exchange and liability offering, at a time when our competitors are looking to reduce investment.</p>
<p>Clients will be looking to tap new sources of liquidity and to reshape their balance sheets. Lloyds TSB Corporate Markets is well placed to help them in both respects. Across the wider business, we will continue to develop our debt capital markets offering and in fact, we’ve been very successful in developing this platform from a standing start.</p>
<p>In the past 18 months we have increased the number of bonds mandates that we have led – 13 corporate and 13 institutional deals in that period. And I am proud to say that on the back of some of these deals my teams have also been able to increase the number of swap auctions they have led.</p>
<p>We also have a developing equity capital markets platform and we are working appropriately with this team to ensure we move forward together to serve our franchise.</p>
<p>Lastly, the focus for 2010 is not only integration in a client-centred way, but also embedding and increasing the multi-asset class, risk advisory services that we offer to make sure that we can continue to differentiate ourselves in this space.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-your-best-piece-of-advice-for-treasurers-at-the-moment">What is your best piece of advice for treasurers at the moment?</h5>
<p>I think the important thing is to continue to take some time out of busy schedules to be open with your trusted banks. As costs are cut across the board, a bank’s risk solutions team can provide some interesting input to ensure the conclusion of some key challenges, in what are very unique times for us all.</p>

</div>
<h5 id="what-impact-has-the-financial-crisis-had-on-transaction-banking">Broadly, what impact has the financial crisis had on transaction banking?</h5>
<p>In the past year, unprecedented turbulence in the world’s markets has seen the banking landscape shift radically as the whole financial system came under pressure. At the same time, the priorities of corporates have changed substantially − not least because credit is now more scarce and expensive.</p>
<p>So what implications will these two dramatic changes have on transaction banking? One possible repercussion is that banks may review their distribution and operating models and refocus on core markets. This will drive where and how they operate in transaction banking. There are already examples of some regional institutions changing their strategy in favour of their home market, exiting from non-core business lines and partnering with third-party institutions to more effectively manage their infrastructure and cost base and enhance their global capabilities.</p>
<p>In practical terms, the decision of a number of banks − either through choice or circumstance − to redesign or scale down their operations will accelerate the long-standing trend of consolidation in the industry. Only a handful of global banks will be able to provide a truly competitive global offering.</p>
<h5 id="what-makes-a-global-offering-so-appealing">What makes a global offering so appealing?</h5>
<p>Some of the banks that have retreated from a global transaction banking model now suggest that working with several different banks in each region provides clients with much-needed diversification and enhances risk management.</p>
<p>However, while multiple banking relationships across geographies may be an effective model for some clients, the scale and reach enabled by a globally interconnected infrastructure and network remains extremely valuable. Moreover, such a global perspective can allow a more comprehensive and effective risk management architecture.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“While multiple banking relationships across geographies may be an effective model for some clients, the scale and reach enabled by a globally interconnected infrastructure and network remains extremely valuable.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having a global network and interconnected platforms also allows for scale that enables the delivery of premium quality products and services. Being a global player provides banks not only with significant scale, and hence a lower cost base, but also experience and knowledge. It facilitates innovation, technology investment, infrastructure support and research and development capabilities that allow us to create solutions that are very hard to match.</p>
<h5 id="do-you-see-transaction-banking-making-a-significant-contribution-to-risk-management">Do you see transaction banking making a significant contribution to risk management?</h5>
<p>Absolutely. The focus of innovation in transaction banking in recent years has been threefold:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To improve working capital.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To increase visibility and information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To enhance efficiency.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These three objectives remain central for all corporate treasurers, but now risk management is critical. It is not necessarily about the creation of complex off-balance sheet structures – it’s about understanding flows, smarter analytics and the enhanced use of them to mitigate risk. Technology simply makes a bank such as Citi a more effective enabler of end-to-end risk management for corporates.</p>
<h5 id="how-can-risk-management-benefit">And so going back to a global offering, how can risk management benefit?</h5>
<p>A good example is the mitigation of foreign exchange volatility. Historically, the main focus of many cash management structures has been on netting or pooling funds in order to balance long and short cash positions to improve working capital. The current volatile FX environment imposes new, heightened requirements to manage multiple currencies effectively. Consequently, existing cash management and trade structures need to be enhanced to reflect new risks arising from currency volatility.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Existing cash management and trade structures need to be enhanced to reflect new risks arising from currency volatility.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inevitably, global providers are better positioned to offer an interconnected infrastructure that facilitates multi-currency solutions. Moreover, the vast resources on which global providers can draw enable them – with the necessary expertise and innovation in product design – to be able to react to such challenges rapidly.</p>
<h5 id="how-are-corporates-priorities-changing">How are corporates’ priorities changing?</h5>
<p>While the banking world has been undergoing unprecedented change, the volatility in financial markets is having similarly profound implications for corporates. Paramount among these is the reduced capacity of banks to extend credit facilities to corporates at the same time that many sources of capital markets funding have become constrained.</p>
<p>Given the tightening of external funding and liquidity, corporates are now placing a high priority on working capital. For a long time, abundant and cheap credit meant that the cost of working capital inefficiencies was low. Clients now are focusing on reducing working capital by streamlining the supply chain and cash management processes. The consequence of companies managing their cash much more efficiently is inevitably less idle cash.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For a long time, abundant and cheap credit meant that the cost of working capital inefficiencies was low.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="this-sounds-as-though-it-could-be-bad-news-for-banks">This sounds as though it could be bad news for banks?</h5>
<p>From the perspective of banks, balances are shrinking and risk is growing, while the cost of infrastructure remains fixed. For many institutions, it is a real challenge to move from a model that relies heavily (in some cases entirely) on revenues from balances to a pricing model that reflects true value.</p>
<p>Banks with a track record of successfully providing their clients with end-to-end treasury solutions and proactively assisting them to increase their efficiencies have faced the pricing paradox for a long time. As an effective solution, such institutions have already introduced a new pricing model based on variable pricing and costs, which places an increased emphasis on fees. In this new model, the ability to lower costs through scale, volume and technology will be the key to competitiveness.</p>
<h5 id="what-impact-has-the-crisis-had-on-credit-exposure">What impact has the crisis had on credit exposure?</h5>
<p>The financial crisis has redefined both the concept of credit risk and the cost of credit. A striking illustration of this is daylight (intraday) limits. The turmoil has generated a fresh perspective on exposures and risks. We are now more conscious of our intraday limits.</p>
<p>Recent events have not only highlighted the implications of insolvency on intraday credit facilities – the notion of cost has also evolved. The contraction in inter-bank liquidity and willingness to lend results in a knock-on effect on the velocity of cash which, in turn, creates a cost. While intraday credit operates differently for financial institutions and corporates, it is not inconceivable that some banks will identify this credit facility as a value added service that should be offered at a price. Or, alternatively, an opportunity for the clients’ infrastructures to be enhanced for increased efficiency to control these funds in the payment systems.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the reduced balance sheet capacity in the banking sector is changing how credit is originated and structured. For example, where once banks were willing to back trade facilities worth hundreds of millions of dollars for a client, the emphasis for all banks is now on syndication, club deals and risk participation. Ideas from the syndicated loan market are taking hold in trade. The necessity of sharing risks is leading to the establishment of an ‘originate to distribute’ model. Some banks, including Citi, foresaw this trend and proactively adopted it in their strategic toolkit at an early stage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The reduced balance sheet capacity in the banking sector is changing how credit is originated and structured.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="what-can-corporates-do-to-protect-themselves-from-counterparty-risk-in-their-supply-chain">In the current environment the failure of one company can have wider implications for others who depend on them. What can corporates do to protect themselves from counterparty risk in their supply chain?</h5>
<p>On the supplier side, corporates need to ensure that they have an uninterrupted supply of components and materials from their key suppliers – the failure of just one critical supplier in the chain could disrupt a production momentum and the shipment of stock to its distribution network for months.</p>
<p>Take, for example, a major global paper products manufacturer that relies on critical supplies from Eastern and Western Europe. Citi has deep knowledge of the industry and was able to partner with both the manufacturer and its European suppliers to ensure the supply chain is robust during this difficult economic environment.</p>
<p>These suppliers are experiencing the same issues of credit risk and availability and, therefore, enlightened corporates are allowing their suppliers to take advantage of their creditworthiness to access cheaper finance. In some markets this may be the only source of finance available to the supplier, who, in turn, provides the corporate with the assurance of continuous supply.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Enlightened corporates are allowing their suppliers to take advantage of their creditworthiness to access cheaper finance.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="how-do-you-see-the-future-beyond-the-turbulence">How do you see the future beyond the turbulence?</h5>
<p>Client relationships will no longer just revolve around the provision of processing capability and lending capacity. They will also take into account the tools and platforms that enable companies to view and forecast their cash flow and manage their working capital and risk across bank providers and geographies. In this new era, global transaction banks are well placed to provide clients with reach, expertise, innovation and scale.</p>
<p>Two developments are critical for the industry: the first is that improving the working capital efficiency of clients will result in new cost and revenue dynamics; the second is that the financial crisis is revealing the true cost of credit. Both of these trends are expected to result in new value added services and more transparency in pricing.</p>
<p>Corporates must choose a banking partner with the right experience, product capabilities, network reach and infrastructure. Citi has continued to nurture transaction banking business throughout the turmoil. Our message has remained constant: Citi remains committed to transaction banking. Transaction banking is core to Citi. Our competitive advantage is our global presence and we will continue to invest to deliver better products and services to our clients so they can minimise risks and optimise cash.</p></div>

<h5 id="what-are-the-main-issues-that-corporates-are-facing-right-now">What are the main issues that corporates are facing right now and how are they addressing them?</h5>
<p>I usually meet with four or five corporates each week and what I hear from most of these corporates is that managing working capital and access to liquidity are their main concerns in the current economic environment. In my opinion they are doing two things to address these concerns: they are reviewing their banking relationships and are looking to optimise internal sources of funding.</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, I would say that half of the corporates I talk to are looking to review their banking relationships. On the one hand, they have a counterparty risk exposure to their banks arising from their investments and deposits. On the other, they need access to credit from their banks. Corporates that are working with banks that are experiencing severe trouble are in certain cases considering foregoing efficiency and single bank solutions, and adding one or two additional banks to their cash management structure. I think in today’s environment, where connectivity has become more standardised and with SWIFT MA-CUGs and SCORE also playing a role, it’s easier to add other banks to your structure without necessarily incurring additional cost and compromising on efficiency.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-corporates-looking-at-when-they-review-their-banks">What are corporates looking at when they review their banks?</h5>
<p>Different corporates have different ways of evaluating their banks – whether it’s Tier 1 capital, whether it’s a credit rating, whether it’s looking at their balance sheet and seeing to what extent certain toxic assets are still left. Or it could be the bank’s strategy – for example, how does your bank stabilise cyclical businesses with more stable businesses?</p>
<p>Following the uncertainty we were seeing last October, government ownership of certain banks was seen as a comfort factor. However, now that corporates have had time to think, they are looking more critically at the impact of government ownership on banks and on their strategies.</p>
<p>Transaction banking is very capital intensive in terms of investment in innovation. The question that some corporates are asking today is, does the bank have its hands free to continue to invest in the latest technology, or even in its international network?</p>
<h5 id="you-also-mentioned-that-corporates-are-looking-for-internal-funding-sources">You also mentioned that corporates are looking for internal funding sources.</h5>
<p>Yes – with credit becoming tighter and the price of credit more expensive, corporates are asking what they can do to find working capital efficiencies internally. This has led to two types of discussions.</p>
<p>The first of these is liquidity management. Corporates that do not already have an efficient cash pooling structure or centralised liquidity management are very quickly putting those structures in place. This enables them to recycle liquidity within the group itself. Other corporates, those that are not ready for a cash pool yet, at least want to have visibility on what liquidity is available, via electronic banking or other means.</p>
<p>The other aspect that corporates are looking at is more efficient financial supply chain management. First of all they are concerned about the health of their suppliers. In certain industries, especially where suppliers are specialised and there are few alternatives, corporates want to make sure their suppliers actually survive.</p>
<p>They also want to make sure the payment terms they have with their suppliers are efficient and provide them with breathing room in terms of working capital. So they are looking for efficiencies and are adopting platforms that go from invoice management all the way to providing supplier financing. They are also focusing on making the terms of supplier payments more transparent, and therefore up for negotiation and potential longer payment terms, as well as discounting possibilities so that suppliers can receive their funds more quickly.</p>
<p>These are of course long-term trends but they have tended to be accelerated by the crisis. With credit markets becoming more difficult, there’s a lot of pressure to become more efficient internally.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-deutsche-bank-doing-to-remain-competitive-in-the-current-market">What is Deutsche Bank doing to remain competitive in the current market?</h5>
<p>Firstly we are capitalising on our financial strength, to continue to be the destination of what I would call the flight to quality. This is a direct response to the first concern that corporates are having: re-evaluating their banking relationships and assessing the financial stability of their partners. We believe we are in a position of strength as far as financial flexibility is concerned. With regard to Tier 1 capital and access to liquidity, our most recent results have provided comfort to the markets. The leverage ratios of the bank have also come down significantly compared to our competitors and we have been very transparent with our balance sheet.</p>
<p>We are also continuing to maintain a balanced business model. We have our investment banking activities, which by nature are cyclical, and we also have our more stable activities, such as commercial and transaction banking, which are less cyclical by nature of the flows. So that has put a lot of stability in the results of the bank and has given our clients further comfort.</p>
<p>Another important aspect is the fact that we have not relied on government help, which means that we are fully flexible in terms of our investment strategy. This allows us to continue to build our activities at a time when not many banking organisations are really investing and growing, and we are proud to be in that situation.</p>
<p>As a result of capitalising on our financial strength and being the destination for flight to quality, we are receiving massive amounts of liquidity from corporates today, because they do view us as a safe haven. We are also increasing our corporate market share in terms of transaction banking. Even for corporates we did not previously have relationships with, we are often being asked to step in and provide services alongside one or two other banks that were previously used, again because we are seen as a safe haven.</p>
<h5 id="in-which-areas-is-deutsche-bank-currently-investing">You mentioned your investment strategy. In which areas is Deutsche Bank currently investing?</h5>
<p>We are continuing to grow transaction banking, which is a stable business. We have invested massively in product innovation and our global channels for payments and collections in the past five years. Our investment in platforms is key for what we view as the consolidation that will continue to take place in the next couple of years, and the additional volumes of transactions that will come to us.</p>
<p>We have invested in SEPA and SEPA platforms, to differentiate ourselves from the competitors, and also to offer corporates solutions that make their transition to SEPA as smooth as possible. SEPA may have been overshadowed by larger topics, but corporates are looking for efficiency and cost savings and SEPA can provide these things. That’s why corporates are pursuing those projects as well – and so are we, in terms of our investments.</p>
<p>A related aspect is our investment in new innovative end products. We have launched a couple of new solutions over the past few months. One is a product which we call FX4Cash. This is a new cross-currency payment solution and it’s been developed jointly between the transaction bank and our global market teams. This was launched in July 2008 and it enables clients to make payments in up to 76 different currencies using a single funding account. In other words, clients do not necessarily have to open accounts in different currencies to make one-off payments or infrequent payments.</p>
<p>The other example is our card acquiring proposition, which we launched last summer. We have established an entity called Deutsche Card Services, which is a fully owned subsidiary of Deutsche Bank, and we are offering a pan-European solution to companies which are looking to the new SEPA environment to centralise their card acquiring collections as well to gain more efficiency. This proposition provides a lot of value-add in terms of reporting and in terms of managing the entire cycle of flows related to card collections, and it brings a lot of automation to the process.</p>
<h5 id="do-you-have-any-plans-for-geographical-expansion-in-the-near-future">Do you have any plans for geographical expansion in the near future?</h5>
<p>We’re continuing to invest in geography, because we believe that despite the current financial crisis, we are still living in a globalised world. Our corporates are asking us to be in more countries, or to increase our presence in certain countries.</p>
<p>For example, we are committed to investments in Europe. In a press release last year, we announced our intention to widen our domestic presence in the Netherlands. We are also growing further within Germany via another transaction that’s been in the news with Deutsche Postbank. We are making investments in Eastern Europe with a view of opening up more countries. We have recently received a more comprehensive wholesale banking license in the UAE, and we are building that proposition up too. And we are beefing up our presence in Latin America, to go deeper into markets such as Brazil and Argentina.</p>
<p>This is being complemented by our ongoing investment in China, which is very important for corporates, as well as places like India, which represent a huge market.</p>
<h5 id="what-other-areas-is-deutsche-bank-focusing-on-in-2009">What other areas is Deutsche Bank focusing on in 2009?</h5>
<p>We are continuing to invest in people. The Global Transaction Bank actually increased its headcount by over 10% in 2008. There are not too many examples in the market of banks actually hiring staff these days, so this is very motivating for the team. There is a lot of pride in being part of Deutsche Bank – I have never seen it so high.</p>
<p>I was in Switzerland a couple of days ago and two of my clients were saying, “Your slogan is ‘A passion to perform’ and we actually see this passion in the faces of the team sitting in front of us.” That is one of the crucial points of the success that we’ve been having, because banking is a people business – it’s all about people skills and delivering on our commitments.</p>
<p>One other aspect that I wanted to mention is that before making any investment, whether in terms of geography or products, we actually consult our clients. We hold regular forums where we listen to the strategic requirements of our clients and ask how we can improve certain services or our geographical presence. Once we’ve ensured that the demand is there, we respond to that demand.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We hold regular forums where we listen to the strategic requirements of our clients and ask how we can improve certain services or our geographical presence.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are also continuing our drive to become a market leader in terms of the on-boarding of new clients to our systems. In cash management, when you embark on a project with a particular bank, you need to open accounts, put in place banking systems or connectivity and receive training on some of the products. In today’s environment, where corporates are looking for additional banking partners, they want this to happen as quickly and efficiently as possible. We have recently invested a lot in technology to accelerate on-boarding processes.</p>
<p>Ongoing customer service is another key topic. We regularly have very positive feedback on our customer service model, which is decentralised, so it’s actually in the countries rather than having a central call centre. This means that we are close to the corporate entity in each country, and this close proximity allows us to be in contact with them, know how they operate and therefore provide a very customised and a user-friendly service. That is a pillar of our strategy and we are continuing to invest in that.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-expect-the-transaction-banking-landscape-to-develop-in-the-current-conditions">How do you expect the transaction banking landscape to develop in the current conditions?</h5>
<p>I see government support as a temporary measure to bring confidence to the market. I believe that regulation of certain aspects of banking is definitely needed to put certain controls on certain activities. At the same time, I think it’s also a question of where the banking community sees itself going forward and I see a clear trend towards more corporate and commercial banking investment. Banks are seeing the value of their stable businesses more and more these days and are looking to further invest in these areas.</p>
<p>However, transaction banking is very capital intensive. The barriers to entry are significant because the level of investment is high and the fees are low, so it’s really a volume game, and there’s only so much volume around in the market today – not everybody can become a transaction bank and make it a profitable proposition.</p>
<p>There may be a focus on commercial and transaction banking today but not everybody will be able to make those investments. Those who are today’s strong players in transaction banking, and who are also financially healthy, are probably the winners of tomorrow’s game.</p>
<p>Overall I would say all the areas we have discussed – our financial strength, the flight to quality, our continuing investments in innovation, geography, customer service and on-boarding – allow us to continue to support corporates in today’s environment as much as in yesterday’s environment, and positions us as a strong player in a consolidating market.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>This month we talk to Kathleen Hughes about the impact of the financial crisis on money market funds and discuss the factors that investors should consider when investing in a fund.</p>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Kathleen Hughes</h4>
<h5 class="title">Managing Director, Head of Global Liquidity EMEA</h5>
<img alt="J.P. Morgan Asset Management" class="logo org" height="30" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/jpmorgan-asset-management-logo-2012-90x30.png" width="90"/>
<p>Kathleen Hughes, Managing Director, is head of the Global Liquidity business in EMEA focusing primarily on Institutional Liquidity Funds. An employee since 1990, Kathleen was previously head of the corporate sales strategy and head of the relationship management strategy for the Global Liquidity business in Europe. Before joining J.P. Morgan Asset Management, she was a relationship manager and business development officer for the Wealthy Family Group in J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. Kathleen obtained a BA in Economics from the University of Richmond, USA.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-changes-are-there-in-the-way-you-manage-your-fund-investments-as-a-result-of-the-banking-crisis-and-the-turbulence-in-the-money-markets">What changes are there in the way you manage your fund investments as a result of the banking crisis and the turbulence in the money markets?</h5>
<p>Since August 2007, when the first ripples from rising sub-prime mortgage defaults began impacting the short-term money markets, J.P. Morgan has been proactively positioning its funds to continue to do what they have always done – provide liquidity for clients with a stable net asset value (NAV). Our portfolios are managed conservatively, with rigorous attention to risk management and to our credit process.</p>
<p>One notable change is that we’ve increased the overnight cash that the portfolios are holding. Before August 2007, approximately 10% of the portfolio would mature on an overnight basis. Since August 2007 our overnight cash position has been between 20% and 40%. This overnight cash is usually in the form of bank deposits or collateralised government reverse repurchase (reverse repo) agreements.</p>
<p>We also reduced exposure to certain asset classes. Some of this was deliberate as we moved away from certain names that no longer met our strict risk management policies, but other reductions were due to significant changes in the issuance market. This was particularly the case with the Asset Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP) market, where there are fewer issuers today than there were 18 months ago, and therefore less for us to buy. However, we still like the asset class and we continue to use ABCP in our portfolios.</p>
<p>One final change has been to our approved list. We’ve reduced the number of names that we are comfortable buying for these portfolios and have also reduced the maximum tenor for certain names.</p>
<p>As the banking industry shows further signs of deterioration, the market is questioning the creditworthiness of all names. We have managed our portfolios defensively for some time now and are focused on direct sovereign exposures and bank names in countries where we have the greatest conviction about the authorities’ ability and willingness to stand behind their guarantees. These countries include the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, France and Canada.</p>
<p>Our AAA rated stable NAV liquidity funds have zero tolerance for losses and the risk management and credit research resources that we have in place has certainly helped us to successfully navigate the difficult markets of the past 18 months, and in particular the fourth quarter of 2008. Our focus on risk management has served us and our clients well as J.P. Morgan’s AAA rated liquidity funds have benefited from the flight to quality.</p>
<p>For the full year 2008 our international liquidity funds have grown by $77 billion. Globally, we have grown assets by $215 billion, with $112 billion of that coming into our funds since 15<sup>th</sup> September 2008 (iMoneyNet, Dec 31, 2008). We continue to be the largest AAA rated liquidity fund manager in the international space with $180 billion in assets under management in USD, EUR and GBP denominated funds (iMoneyNet, Feb 6, 2009).</p>
<h5 id="does-this-mean-returns-are-lower">Does this mean returns are lower?</h5>
<p>Returns are trending lower due to Zero Interest Rate Policies (ZIRP), not due to changes in asset mix or portfolio construction. If anything our asset mix and the trades that we made in the fourth quarter of last year are now resulting in higher yields in relation to overnight rates. However, this trend will not continue as this higher yielding paper rolls off.</p>
<h5 id="wouldnt-i-be-better-off-investing-with-a-too-big-to-fail-bank">Wouldn’t I be better off investing with a ‘too big to fail’ bank?</h5>
<p>I would still argue that a proven and robust credit process, the kind that is provided by a professional asset manager, is even more valuable in times of volatility and uncertainty. An institution’s guarantee doesn’t mean that it can’t run into trouble, and if a bank goes under, investors would have to get in line with the other creditors to claim their money back from the government, meaning they would not have access to liquidity during that time. Investment managers get paid to avoid situations such as this, and our credit and risk management processes have proven this during the past 15 months.</p>
<p>In addition, of the financial names we invest in, up to 90% (depending on the currency) enjoy some form of government support, for example from guarantees, political support or equity ownership. This means that we benefit from the government support, but with the overlay of a robust credit process.</p>
<p>Following the events of the past 18 months, I would bet that no investor would blindly buy AAA rated securities or invest in an Icelandic bank just because the deposit rate is high. Those days are behind us and the need for credit expertise is back in vogue.</p>
<h5 id="will-the-fund-accounting-rules-change-because-of-recent-events">Will the fund accounting rules change because of recent events?</h5>
<p>Accrual accounting or amortised cost accounting is a methodology that has been with our industry for over 30 years and has weathered many storms and credit environments. This method is permitted both by international accounting standards and by UCITS regulations. In times like this, it’s normal to question aspects of our industry such as amortised cost accounting, but it would be foolish to abandon a proven and valid approach such as this.</p>
<p>In our portfolios, we hold very high degrees of liquidity in the highest credit quality, shortest term assets. We hold our securities to maturity and as such, amortised cost accounting is the appropriate approach. In the European and UK market there are non-IMMFA money market funds that do not use amortised cost accounting and as a result may have focused on yield as opposed to capital preservation. The very nature of amortised cost accounting forces managers to be very conservative in their approach.</p>
<p>IMMFA stable NAV funds, like their counterparts in the US known as 2a-7 funds, are required to mark their portfolios to market at least weekly and compare the MTM (mark-to-market) price with the amortised cost price. There are strict escalation procedures (governed by both the regulators and by IMMFA code of conduct) that must be followed if the MTM deviates as little as 10 bps (basis points) from the amortised cost of the portfolio.</p>
<h5 id="will-stable-cnav-funds-survive">Will stable (CNAV) funds survive?</h5>
<p>Yes, I believe that there is an important place for CNAV (Constant Net Asset Value) funds within the broader money market fund universe here in Europe. We’ve seen assets flow into CNAV funds as they’ve been favoured for their conservative approach over the non-CNAV money market funds that exist in Europe. For example, during 2008, the CNAV money market fund universe (AAA rated funds) increased in assets by 28% or $128 billion (iMoneyNet, Dec 31, 2008), while the local German money market industry lost 22% of assets (Source: Bundesverband Investment und Asset Management).</p>
<p>One thing that would help would be for investors and regulators across Europe to recognise that CNAV or IMMFA style funds are very different from other money market funds in Europe. In the US, the term ‘money market fund’ is reserved only for the stable NAV or 2a-7 money market funds. In Europe, the term ‘money market fund’ is widely and, arguably, loosely used, encompassing everything from the most conservative IMMFA funds to enhanced yield and short-term bond funds that are managed with more risk in the portfolios.</p>
<h5 id="what-should-an-investor-consider-when-investing-in-a-fund">What should an investor consider when investing in a fund?</h5>
<p>First and most important is the experience of the manager – investors should look for an experienced portfolio management team, credit research team and risk management team who have managed stable NAV money market funds through many different market and interest rate environments. J.P. Morgan has a long history of managing stable NAV funds and our money market fund business comprises 45% of the assets in our global asset management business.</p>
<p>Investors should also choose large funds that are an important part of the broader asset management business that they are associated with. This is a sign that they are well resourced and that the rest of the organisation is committed to the success of the money market funds business.</p>
<p>In addition, investors may want to consider funds with a highly diversified client base, thereby reducing risk from market events that may particularly affect one type of client. An ideal fund would have a variety of client types including corporates, pension funds, banks, central banks, asset managers, other financial institutions and private clients.</p>
<p>The flows that the manager has experienced during 2008 and importantly in the fourth quarter of the year may also be a guide when choosing a fund. The fourth quarter was the biggest stress test that our industry has ever undergone and in general, the industry has passed this test with very high marks. Clients have distinguished between money market providers, however, and the flows can tell a story.</p>
<p>Finally, an investor should consider fees. Experienced portfolio management, robust credit analysis and risk management do not come for free. When you invest in a money market fund you are buying the expertise of the manager. Funds that are priced too cheaply could cause one to question the resources behind the fund.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-treasurers-use-money-market-funds">How do treasurers use money market funds and has this changed in response to the crisis?</h5>
<p>We have seen an increased use of money market funds for a variety of reasons. Treasurers have become increasingly unwilling to rely solely on credit ratings when making investment decisions, but some treasury teams who were investing directly in money market instruments do not have the resources to perform credit analysis themselves. Therefore, they have switched to funds, recognising the benefits of the credit analysis that is behind funds such as those offered by J.P. Morgan.</p>
<p>We’ve also seen some treasurers move away from bank deposits in favour of money market funds as a means of accessing a broad and diversified portfolio. Some treasurers have grown uncomfortable with high concentrations to a single counterparty.</p>
<p>Finally, we’ve seen recognition by treasurers and other investors that not all money market funds are created equal. The largest and most experienced money market managers, such as J.P. Morgan, have benefited the most during this trend.</p>
<h5 id="what-questions-are-customers-asking">What questions are customers asking and what advice are you giving them?</h5>
<p>Clients are looking for more information across the board – more transparency as to our investment process and also our portfolio holdings. Clients, and treasurers in particular, have stepped up their due diligence on managers and I’m sure this trend will continue. I would advise any client to demand as much transparency and information as possible from their managers.</p>
<p>Our clients are also asking us about government-only liquidity funds – an emerging sub-asset class in European money market funds, in which we’ve led the way with the largest US treasury liquidity fund, the first and largest euro government liquidity fund and one of the first pure sterling gilt liquidity funds.</p>
<p>These stable NAV liquidity funds are invested solely in short-term government debt or repurchase agreements collateralised by short-term government debt, and have been popular with treasurers looking to diversify and in some cases add exposure to sovereign or government issuers.</p>
<p>My advice on these types of funds would be to think of them as a complement to traditional liquidity funds. One thing to be aware of in a ZIRP environment is that these funds will be printing very low yields. Many providers, as well as J.P. Morgan, have closed their US treasury funds to new investors; instead, many clients are now using our traditional USD Liquidity fund or they could consider our newly launched US Government Liquidity fund, which invests in US government agency issued securities and repurchase agreements backed by agency paper.</p>

<div class="copy__body"><p>In this month’s Bank Interview we talk to Yera Hagopian about current trends in liquidity management. We discuss how treasurers should go about reviewing their liquidity management structures and explore the factors that should be taken into account during such a review.</p>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Yera Hagopian</h4>
<h5 class="title">Senior Product Manager, Liquidity Services</h5>
<img alt="HSBC The world’s local bank" class="logo org" height="29" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/hsbc-the-worlds-local-bank-2010-90x29.png" width="90"/>
<p>Yera Hagopian read French and Italian at Brasenose College, Oxford before joining Barclays Bank’s Management Development Programme. She worked in Treasury and Relationship Management, including two years in the United States, prior to positions as European Sales Manager in Payments and Cash Management and International Product Director in Global Electronic Banking. In 1999 she joined HSBC as Global Product Manager for Liquidity Services.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-are-your-clients-top-concerns-in-2009">In terms of liquidity management, what are your clients’ top concerns in 2009?</h5>
<p>Well, their top concern is liquidity itself! We are seeing some very major and unprecedented shifts in terms of people’s priorities. It is very clear that accessibility and security are taking priority over yield, and that’s a dramatic change from a year ago. It’s not hard to understand – the cost and unpredictability of externally sourced liquidity is a major concern for our customers.</p>
<p>They are therefore focusing much more on using their own internal sources of liquidity to the fullest extent possible, and adopting a more ruthless approach to this than previously. In the past people might have dismissed savings that were operationally difficult to achieve, because they looked at the situation and thought, “Well maybe I’ll save ten basis points – is it worth it?” So they may have chosen to ignore that little pocket of cash because it wasn’t going to make much difference. Now the situation is different – it’s not just cost but availability that’s the issue, and these types of decisions therefore have to be re-evaluated.</p>
<h5 id="what-types-of-liquidity-management-structure-are-clients-looking-for-at-the-moment">What types of liquidity management structure are clients looking for at the moment?</h5>
<p>I think different structures have always suited different types of businesses. A lot of this is driven by the regulatory environment in particular countries and particular industries.</p>
<p>When we talk about structure, the main question is whether we’re looking at notional pooling or cash concentration. But really that’s too black and white. In order to be totally efficient in a global context, you need to be pragmatic and use whatever is available and feasible from a regulatory perspective to feed into your overall structure. Most people end up with some sort of mix and match structure.</p>
<p>There are two aspects to liquidity management. One aspect is the cost reduction angle, but I would say that the balance of priorities is now much more in favour of the second aspect, which is reducing gearing and improving the balance sheet. That does mean that a level of actual physical consolidation will probably need to take place to enable corporates to be able to report account balances on a net basis. Otherwise they may be realising the benefit in interest terms, but in terms of gearing they may actually not get all the benefits.</p>
<h5 id="do-most-of-your-corporate-clients-have-a-liquidity-management-structure-in-place-already">Do most of your corporate clients have a liquidity management structure in place already?</h5>
<p>It varies hugely. I would say that most of them have some sort of structure in place, but the question is at what level. There may be a structure in place at the domestic level, relatively little in place at the regional level and less again at the global level.</p>
<h5 id="what-can-treasurers-achieve-by-reviewing-their-existing-liquidity-management-structures">What can treasurers achieve by reviewing their existing liquidity management structures?</h5>
<p>Firstly, liquidity structures should be reviewed regularly in any case. No business is static. The currency and market mix will be changing all the time.</p>
<p>People should aim to understand the benefits of the structure better. Any modelling that they might have done two years ago is not going to be valid any more. The cost of funding has changed radically, so the benefit of a liquidity structure is likely to be much greater now. If decisions were made about pursuing things or not pursuing things a couple of years ago for cost-benefit reasons, those equations are likely to have changed dramatically.</p>
<p>People are also looking very carefully at their cash flow. I was going to say they are aiming to avoid surprises, but actually that’s unrealistic because most businesses are trading in very volatile conditions at the moment. Cash flows aren’t that predictable, certainly not in the long-term. Rather than trying to predict the flow, people need to be prepared to deal with the surprises and have contingency plans in place. It’s a question of identifying a problem as early as possible. There is a lot to be said for having some early warning that an expected surplus is no longer going to appear and that the company’s borrowing requirement is going to jump as a result. You don’t want surprises like that.</p>
<p>It is also worth reviewing the processes that are in place and determining whether they are still fit for purpose. There was a lot of focus on automating everything a while ago in the name of cost reduction. Cost reduction is still important, but the truth is that accuracy and control may be more important. In an environment where banks themselves are watching Risk Weighted Assets far more closely than before, unauthorised overdrafts may attract hefty penalties. And that may mean it is not possible to automate everything, or at least if you automate everything you’re still going to have to keep a level of supervision over it. While this may result in an increased headcount cost, the benefit of increased control and fewer errors may be worth the extra cost.</p>
<h5 id="how-should-treasurers-go-about-reviewing-their-existing-structures">How should treasurers go about reviewing their existing structures? Where should they start?</h5>
<p>People have to start at quite a macro level. The numbers are always a good place to start. First of all you need to distinguish between the available cash and unavailable cash – for example, cash that cannot be utilised for regulatory purposes. The unavailable cash needs to be taken out of the equation and other, possibly local or ring-fenced, solutions found.</p>
<p>Once you have identified the available cash, you need to figure out how much is currently being left on the table. Then you should be asking, if it is available then why is it not being used? Is it because there is some inefficiency in the process? Is there no process in place? Has the business changed? Is it taking too long to bring new markets or companies into the structure? Have you gone into new markets? Have the markets themselves changed?</p>
<h5 id="how-can-the-efficiency-of-the-existing-structure-be-measured">How can the efficiency of the existing structure be measured?</h5>
<p>When you are looking at the available cash flow and evaluating what sources of internal funding are available to the company, a measure would be what proportion of this is being utilised. And for a more absolute measure, you can look at what proportion of your liquidity needs is being met internally versus externally. If you’re trying to build a business case, that’s pretty compelling. It’s tricky though, because there could be good reasons why that balance might change as a result of market conditions – for example, if customers of one business line are delaying payments and this cannot be controlled – so targets need to be reviewed regularly. People can also look to benchmark with similar companies.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the opportunity cost of getting it wrong or of having idle balances is actually growing. On the one hand there is a credit crunch on; on the other, interest rates are declining. Previously, if you got it wrong and left a few hundred thousand in an account somewhere, it was likely that you would still get some credit interest on it and the difference between that and the borrowing costs you incurred somewhere else probably wouldn’t be that great. Now, with interest rates as low as they are in major currencies and rocketing borrowing costs, the difference is likely to be much greater.</p>
<h5 id="what-other-factors-should-be-considered">What other factors should be considered?</h5>
<p>If you want your liquidity management to improve then having a more streamlined accounts structure is definitely a major factor. SEPA has brought some opportunities to achieve that, although not everyone has gone through that process yet.</p>
<p>The other thing that people need to consider is what happens at the local account level. So often treasury looks at what happens at the centre but sometimes things may be overlooked as a result. If the process isn’t working and the management of the balance of the local account is a little unpredictable, you may end up incurring overdraft charges on the local accounts. Those costs may actually eliminate the benefit of the liquidity structure.</p>
<p>Another factor that may need to be looked at is internal transfer pricing practices. Transactions that were priced at arm’s length previously may no longer pass the test. The benefit which is passed to a lending entity within a pool should reflect market reality. Apart from other considerations, such as tax impacts, a fair return is the best way to motivate full participation.</p>
<p>Of course, any revised business case has to be honest and capture increased costs as well as benefits. It is also worth considering that local bank relationships may have been priced on the assumption that there was going to be some sort of float. However, that float may disappear once an efficient liquidity structure is put in place, which may lead to some sort of local repricing. You may not know that immediately; it’s something that happens over a period of time. When you do a review, it is a good time to ascertain whether there have been any other impacts.</p>
<h5 id="what-about-the-reversal-we-are-seeing-in-the-trend-to-consolidate-bank-relationships">What about the reversal we are seeing in the trend to consolidate bank relationships – does this have an impact?</h5>
<p>It can complicate things. With credit not as readily available that does put pressure on companies to maintain a larger number of bank relationships, which then raises the operational risk and financial cost of running a liquidity structure. While that does make it more difficult to build an efficient process, within that there are probably still opportunities for consolidation and rationalisation.</p>
<h5 id="how-are-corporates-changing-their-liquidity-structures-as-a-result-of-this-type-of-review">How are corporates changing their liquidity structures as a result of this type of review?</h5>
<p>I think they’re becoming more open-minded about solutions. They are looking into new markets, markets they hadn’t necessarily considered before. For example, we’ve been working with WPP on their Turkish lira pool, which was established as part of their local business review.</p>
<p>We’ve enjoyed a long standing transaction banking and liquidity management relationship with them and we were helping them to consolidate their in-country transactional banking. As part of that there was also a review of their liquidity management, which led to the establishment of the Turkish lira pool in London. WPP can now consolidate and maximise the returns on the residual balances at the treasury level. It’s not necessarily a market that people would have looked at previously for the purposes of a liquidity management structure.</p>
<h5 id="do-you-think-theres-a-growing-focus-on-adopting-a-global-or-regional-approach">Do you think there’s a growing focus on adopting a global or regional approach?</h5>
<p>Yes – but I do think that the global level is the wrong place to start. Liquidity management has to start at the local level. It has to be a bottom-up process because if the local level is not properly organised this will be evident at the top level. I think a country by country approach needs to be taken and local practices and arrangements rationalised, particularly in terms of account structure and internal co-ordination.</p>
<p>The approach taken will depend on the nature of the individual business. If a business requires a very extensive network of banks, for example because it has retail customers in a large country and it needs to be able to get cash and cheques into those accounts, then that drives a certain type of account structure. Payments can still be consolidated somewhere but it does mean that there will be a separate structure for the collections side of the business. Local business requirements and their impact on liquidity management have to be understood before you can start superimposing too many additional structures.</p>
<h5 id="how-is-hsbc-adapting-to-the-evolving-market">How is HSBC adapting to the evolving market?</h5>
<p>We are continuing to invest heavily in this product area because it’s becoming more important to our customers. We are ensuring that anything we develop now is particularly flexible and that it is developed on a global platform.</p>
<p>To explain what I mean by flexible – for example, looking at notional pooling, the definition of notional pooling differs from market to market because set-off is not necessarily a recognised concept in some markets. Any product that you develop therefore has to be able to deal with all sorts of different permutations and interpretations. With the products that we’re developing now, we are able to price based on full set-off or not, depending on what’s achievable at a global, regional or local level.</p>
<h5 id="and-i-think-you-said-earlier-that-most-people-will-end-up-adopting-some-sort-of-hybrid-structure">And I think you said earlier that most people will end up adopting some sort of hybrid structure.</h5>
<p>Yes, because they look at it country by country and they’ll do whatever they need to do to best realise their liquidity. And that will be different in different markets.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-see-liquidity-management-developing-in-the-future">How do you see liquidity management developing in the future?</h5>
<p>I think it all depends on what happens in the evolving market. We are seeing a lot more interest in cross-currency solutions. Part of that is due to the fact that the FX markets are very volatile as well. The spreads on FX swaps have been very wide and any cash management structure that exposes a customer to that sort of volatility is not really desirable. Some providers of cross-currency solutions can help to mitigate this type of daily exposure, so that is driving greater interest.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>We interview Daniel Marovitz, Head of Product Management for Deutsche Bank Global Transaction Banking, about technology trends in the transaction banking arena and some of Deutsche Bank’s latest products. We also discuss the continuing market turmoil and the impact on corporate treasurers.</p>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Daniel Marovitz</h4>
<h5 class="title">Head of Product Management, Global Transaction Banking</h5>
<img alt="Deutsche Bank" class="logo org" height="18" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/deutsche-bank-logo-2011-120x18.png" width="120"/>
<p>Daniel Marovitz is the Head of Product Management for Deutsche Bank’s Global Transaction Banking division. Daniel joined Deutsche Bank in 2000 as Managing Director and Chief Operating Officer of the eGCI group at Deutsche Bank, charged with developing and implementing online products for Deutsche Bank’s investment and commercial bank.</p>
<p>Daniel joined Deutsche Bank from iVillage, the online Women’s Network and one of the 15 most trafficked sites on the internet, where he was Vice President of Commerce from early 1999. Before iVillage, Daniel worked for Gateway 2000 where he served as the head of Gateway.com which sold the first PC over the internet. Prior to this, Daniel was on the founding team of Gateway’s Japanese subsidiary.</p>
<p>A frequent speaker on the subjects of the internet, IT management, and outsourcing, Daniel has addressed audiences around the world. In 2001, he co-authored Three Clicks Away: Advice from the Trenches of eCommerce, published by John Wiley. Daniel graduated from Cornell University in 1994.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-are-your-areas-of-responsibility">What are your areas of responsibility?</h5>
<p>I took on the role of Head of Product Management last September. At that time, we moved trade into the product management function, which until then had predominantly been focused on cash. Cash and trade are now under my responsibility and we have also made some changes around the strategy and management of the overall technology and operations groups and infrastructure. Although I am not directly responsible for product management relating to our trust and securities services product, I do have responsibility for the interface with our internal technology group and operations group across everything we do in the transaction bank.</p>
<p>This was a pretty big change structurally and there were a number of reasons for this restructuring. One is that in the transaction banking business, the percentage of revenue that is consumed by technology and operations and infrastructure is significant. Particularly as the Global Transaction Banking (GTB) platform is now a mature business and has gone through a huge amount of growth, we felt that it was important that somebody sitting on the GTB executive committee had a holistic view across what we were doing with technology and operations. We recognised the opportunities for synergy.</p>
<h5 id="what-areas-have-you-been-concentrating">In your new role, on what areas have you been concentrating?</h5>
<p>It has become clear that some banks offering transaction banking services do not always make life as easy as possible for their customers. Moreover, in general, liquidity issues are becoming more critical. As companies find it more difficult to tap the capital markets whenever they want, people are instead more focused on squeezing every last penny out of the system. That means they are focusing on cash, trade instruments and liquidity. Those corporate buyers are confronted with the fact that a lot of what banks offer them is really complex, with lots of different legal agreements and different jurisdictions, different legal agreements for different products, different systems which don’t talk to each other, different passwords and lots of geography-specific systems that do not offer a global perspective.</p>
<p>An important element of our strategy is and will always be to make life as easy as possible for our clients. While that might sound like a pat thing to say, we think this differentiates us from some of our competitors. Deutsche Bank is well-known for its product quality.</p>
<p>We have taken a number of steps in order to achieve this ease for the client. For example, we have a system for enquiry investigation which serves corporates and we have another system which largely serves financial institutions (FIs). We also have an electronic banking system, db-direct internet (db-di), which has historically been focused more on corporates but is increasingly being used by FIs. I am responsible for these three systems and have been tasked with pulling them all together: firstly, by aligning the client interfaces, so the client does not have to access different systems for initiating a payment and another for checking what went wrong with the payment, and secondly by tying all the pieces together from a back-end perspective.</p>
<h5 id="what-cultural-changes-have-you-implemented">What cultural changes have you implemented?</h5>
<p>I have been drawing attention to trends and developments beyond the world of transaction banking. Often in the commercial banking world people tend to think that what happens in the retail consumer world isn’t very relevant. I think that’s misguided because corporate treasurers are also consumers, they know what’s happening in the general world of the internet, they understand eBay, they use Google, they have an iPod and, therefore, they have a sense of what’s possible and how systems behave.</p>
<p>The issue is that what happens in the consumer world tends to be much more advanced than what happens in the commercial world. It is clear why this is the case: certain dot-com companies have millions of clients, whereas there are only a few hundred thousand corporates. So by definition the commercial banking’s user basis is constrained since what you can learn is based on just thousands of customers vs. the feedback of millions of customers.</p>
<p>So what does that mean for us? An area that we are focusing on is the need for respecting people’s time. Certain consumer-based technology firms are known for building products which don’t require the reading of manuals to understand them. Could we achieve that with products for corporate treasurers? We will have to wait and see, but it’s a useful benchmark.</p>
<h5 id="how-far-along-are-you-with-this">How far along are you with this?</h5>
<p>We started this effort back in January 2008 and it’s influencing much of what we do. We have hired some people with retail banking experience, particularly on the portal and the access channel side. Someone who has been working on producing online banking applications for a retail bank serving millions of customers has a different view of things than somebody who works to serve 50,000 corporate clients. Those are some of the tangible items that we’re focusing on and you’ll start to see more advances as we get into next year.</p>
<h5 id="could-you-talk-me-through-some-of-the-new-products-you-have-been-developing">Could you talk me through some of the new products you have been developing?</h5>
<p>Let’s start with the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). When SEPA began coming down the pipe in earnest a few years ago, there were lots of banks who chose to ignore it, or chose to fight it, or chose to do the minimum. In part because we represent absolute dominant share in the euro, we embraced it enthusiastically. We realised that although banks are not necessarily excited about SEPA’s impact on their bottom line, as it controls and constrains pricing, it could be an enormous opportunity for us to be a consolidator. Our approach to SEPA is: whether you’re a corporate or whether you’re another bank, you don’t need to worry about it. If you work with us, we take care of SEPA; we make all the pain and complexity go away. This has been a very successful strategy.</p>
<p>We have banks and corporates from all over the world who have SEPA issues, and they come to us because they know that our technology is robust. We didn’t make a few system tweaks around the edges – we actually put in a brand new SEPA engine, which went live in January 2008. In fact, our direct debit technology was also completed in January 2008, even though direct debits are not scheduled to come on stream until November of next year.</p>
<p>It’s definitely bearing fruit for us in terms of the level of engagement and the kinds of dialogues we’re having with clients, particularly in places where we may not have been so strong in the past. Now that the nation in Europe has become irrelevant from a SEPA perspective, there are lots of people looking to us as a SEPA leader. The fact that we are a very strong German player is irrelevant to them. Instead, what they care about is that we are a strong euro player and a strong SEPA player and we can help them throughout the Eurozone.</p>
<h5 id="are-you-finding-that-take-up-is-low-so-far">Are you finding that take up is low so far?</h5>
<p>SEPA volumes are definitely low but we believe that this is well understood in the industry. That said, the growth rates month on month, although coming from a low base, are pretty impressive and you do not have to extrapolate out too far in the future for it to be a significant part of the payments universe.</p>
<h5 id="what-other-products-have-you-developed">What other products have you developed?</h5>
<p>FX4Cash, our newly-launched global cross-currency payments solution, is a product of which we are particularly proud. FX4Cash was created as a joint effort across two fairly distant parts of Deutsche Bank and it’s a highly powerful combination.</p>
<p>FX4Cash, a payments product rather than an FX product, focuses on ease of use and this sophisticated, 30-second tradable FX capability is embedded into our payments system. A transaction banking client of Deutsche Bank is now getting access to the leading euro clearer and one of the best dollar clearers in the world with a very sophisticated electronic banking interface which scores high marks in industry polls. Behind this solution is the world’s largest FX engine. This product exhibits the enormous strength of Deutsche Bank and the interest has been explosive – it’s been really exciting to see.</p>
<h5 id="who-is-this-new-product-aimed-at">Who is this new product aimed at?</h5>
<p>You name it – it is attractive to many parties. For a corporate treasurer this is an excellent tool, particularly on the high volume, low value transactions side, which often ends up with payments coming in of various types, and a need to make payments in currencies that are not core currencies for you. If a client is using our e-banking portal, db-di, with the click of a button or two you choose the currency pair, you choose the amount, you click for a rate and you secure a rate which is good for 30 seconds. This is a real market rate – it’s not a rate that’s set once a week or once a month or once a day, which is what some of our competitors are offering. At the moment, we’re up to 92 currencies and we’ll have over 100 available in 2009.</p>
<h5 id="how-is-the-financial-crisis-affecting-your-clients-in-terms-of-liquidity">Looking at the industry more generally, how is the financial crisis affecting your clients in terms of liquidity?</h5>
<p>It’s interesting to see how the market is changing from a macroeconomic perspective. A year ago, cash management and liquidity issues were technical issues that treasurers were concerned about and CFOs largely weren’t – and CEOs rarely needed to think about them. Now, when evaluating what’s happened to the inter-bank lending market, when you see the world’s major currencies making 5%, 9%, 12% shifts on a daily basis, all of a sudden these issues, which before were technical and procedural, are now critical.</p>
<p>The market shift has caused banks and companies to think about their cash in a very different way. Their tolerance for setting aside a pool of stranded liquidity for weeks and months has gone down, and companies are, sensibly, much less confident that they can tap the capital markets to raise equity or debt easily and at an acceptable price. These dynamics drive CEOs and CFOs to look at their treasurers and say, it is important to extract every penny efficiently out of the organisation that we run because if we tap the capital markets it’s going to be at a cost – or we may simply not be able to do so.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, treasurers are probably in a position that they have not been in for a long time, where they are even more directly involved in managing the viability, stability and sometimes even the survival of the company.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-people-asking-about-in-particular">What are people asking about in particular?</h5>
<p>Stranded liquidity is an issue. How sweeps are handled is also important because treasurers want to maximise the return on their money, and they don’t want to have money sitting idle. Whereas before this may not have been a central concern, now they care a lot.</p>
<p>They care about security, and there is a ‘flight to quality’ that has benefited Deutsche Bank. The crisis has validated our diversified, stable universal banking model. Companies are still concerned about where the market will head and they are looking to work with banks that they are confident will be there in the future.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>We talk to Erik Zingmark about SEB’s cash management strategy, the challenges and opportunities brought by SEPA and the other trends shaping the payments landscape.</p>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Erik Zingmark</h4>
<h5 class="title">Global Head, Cash Management/Global Transaction Services</h5>
<img alt="SEB" class="logo org" height="50" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/seb-financially-yours-logo-80x50.png" width="80"/>
<p>Erik Zingmark is Global Head of Cash Management at SEB Merchant Banking. Erik has extensive experience of cash and working capital management and has worked in cash management on the buy and sell side, and as a consultant. He was Cash Manager and later EMU Co-ordinator at Skanska Group, before joining ABN AMRO as Head of Cash Management at the bank’s Stockholm branch. Erik was later President and Partner, N&amp;G Financial Consulting. At SEB Merchant Banking, Erik is responsible for cash management in 16 markets.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="how-is-it-possible-for-a-regional-bank-like-seb-to-compete-with-major-international-players-for-international-cash-management-business">How is it possible for a regional bank like SEB to compete with major international players for international cash management business?</h5>
<p>We are extremely fortunate: for the last 150 years SEB has had some of the most sophisticated clients in the world. Corporates in Sweden and the Nordics had relatively small home markets and therefore needed to expand their businesses internationally very early on. SEB followed these corporates in their expansion, continuing to help them with their banking needs. As a result SEB now has a local presence in 27 European countries, through our own network and partnerships, and our global network covers 33 countries, including the US, Canada, China and Singapore.</p>
<p>In order to succeed we have needed to be competitive. Our clients set themselves high standards and therefore expect high standards from their bank. We have raised the bar by measuring our success against the standards of global rather than regional banks. As we could never compete with global banks in terms of size, we have had to be more innovative and to provide services in a smarter way.</p>
<p>For example, SEB went online as early as 1972 with real time banking platforms; we were subsequently among the first to introduce netting and cash pooling in the early eighties and internet banking in the early nineties. We developed web-based cash forecasting ten years ago, which other major banks are only just starting to introduce. The technical maturity of the whole Nordic region has of course helped us to do this.</p>
<p>The key is that development has always been carried out in close co-operation with our clients. This has proven to be a very successful business model and we still work along these lines. We are constantly improving our offering and enhancing customer satisfaction and the liquidity products available to our clients.</p>
<h5 id="how-successful-are-you-in-this-area">How successful are you in this area?</h5>
<p>We are doing very well and we continue to grow and take market share in an extremely competitive market. In the Nordic and Baltic regions SEB has long been the dominant cash management house. We currently act as the main cash management provider for approximately 85% of Nordic multinational clients and 75% of Baltic multinational clients.</p>
<p>Furthermore I think there are few banks that can provide such an extensive list of global, European and Nordic/Baltic awards as SEB can. Just to give some examples, SEB has been awarded ‘No. 1 globally for overall customer satisfaction’ in the Euromoney Cash Management poll 2008, ‘No. 1 globally for level of commitment to the cash management business’ in the Euromoney Cash Management poll for the last three years running, ‘No. 1 globally for global liquidity capabilities’ in the Euromoney Cash Management poll 2008 and ‘No. 1 globally for industry expertise and knowledge’ in the Euromoney Cash Management poll 2007 and 2008.</p>
<h5 id="how-does-seb-drive-innovation-in-cash-management">How does SEB drive innovation in cash management?</h5>
<p>SEB’s philosophy is to work in collaboration with clients in order to create financial and administrative value. This means that we always involve clients throughout the development process with new products, ensuring that we get it exactly right from the beginning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“SEB’s philosophy is to work in collaboration with clients in order to create financial and administrative value. This means that we always involve clients throughout the development process with new products, ensuring that we get it exactly right from the beginning.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SEB also works with a best practice methodology. Indeed, by using one of our solutions, called the Cash Management Value Chain™, our customers are able to measure their cash management, risk management, short-term investment and funding processes against benchmarks set by ‘best in class’ corporates globally. Using this methodology, our customers can increase the efficiency of their processes and lower the total cost of running the cash management business. For SEB it means a larger share of the total cash management market.</p>
<h5 id="what-impact-has-sepa-had-on-treasurers-so-far">Looking at recent changes in the payments market, what impact has SEPA had on treasurers so far?</h5>
<p>So far the impact has been quite limited. I believe that preparation work has started but few treasurers feel that they have made much progress and most are still trying to understand how quickly they should move. They’re also starting to realise that in order to reap the benefits of SEPA, they need to make some adjustments in their own systems.</p>
<p>I think that most treasurers believed that banks would do more or less everything themselves, and that it would be a question of ‘plug and play’ for the corporate environment. Now they are starting to realise that they need to make changes in order to be able to handle XML messages, for example.</p>
<h5 id="what-opportunities-does-sepa-bring-for-treasurers">What opportunities does SEPA bring for treasurers?</h5>
<p>The role of the treasurer is now much more about hands-on support of the business and there are some more responsibilities for efficiency around accounts receivable, accounts payable and working capital. I think that treasurers see a number of potential benefits in the future, such as decreased cost, in terms of both bank costs and efficiency improvements internally. They also see opportunities when it comes to centralisation – it will be easier to set up shared service centres and easier to get an overview on the euro liquidity. Other benefits are harmonisation between the markets, payment instruments and reporting, as well as straight through processing of course.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The role of the treasurer is now much more about hands-on support of the business and there are some more responsibilities for efficiency around accounts receivable, accounts payable and working capital.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="what-qualities-are-most-important-for-a-bank-in-delivering-effective-sepa-solutions">What qualities are most important for a bank in delivering effective SEPA solutions?</h5>
<p>First of all, it should be understood that SEPA is a journey that will go on for many, many years. It is also a facilitator – for the bank, but especially for the corporate – making it easier to centralise, harmonise, improve straight through processing, decrease costs, have information on your liquidity and work on your liquidity management in a more efficient way. It facilitates setting up shared service centres, decreasing counterparties, being more specific towards your IT suppliers.</p>
<p>It is essential for a bank to be able to deliver price and quality. And, as long as they can do that, they are in the game. If they fail on either of those things, corporates will need to move to find another way of handling SEPA.</p>
<p>To be a credible player in SEPA, you need to have the commitment from top management of the bank and top management needs to understand what SEPA is all about. SEPA is not only a part of cash management. It’s a matter of what banks will be: the top account or overlay for a particular corporate’s euro liquidity. And if you have that view on it, it suddenly becomes a top management issue for most banks.</p>
<h5 id="how-is-seb-positioned-and-what-sort-of-solutions-are-you-offering">How is SEB positioned and what sort of solutions are you offering?</h5>
<p>We were ready by 28<sup>th</sup> January and we are continuing to develop additional optional services. We are also, of course, preparing for the PSD and SEPA Direct Debit.</p>
<p>Our view on SEPA is that it’s very easy to be 100% focused on the euro and SEPA, but for most corporates, at least in Europe, you also have to handle other currencies. We offer an approach we call European Liquidity Optimiser, meaning that while we are very focused on SEPA we also want to have a ‘bird’s eye view’ to ensure that we don’t lose sight of the non-euro currencies. The treasurer managing the liquidity needs one point of entry for SEPA and the euro, but also towards the Nordic currencies, for example. So we have the same approach as before, but with an extra focus on SEPA.</p>
<p>On a more practical level, we use the phrase ‘with SEPA inside’, which means that we take our existing processes and integrate the benefits of SEPA. We have the Cash Management Value Chain™ concept, which I mentioned earlier. This is a methodology for going through the in- and out-flow of the company, looking at where you have potential for improvements, both from a cost and quality perspective and from a working capital perspective. We look at all the benefits you find with SEPA and integrate them into this methodology.</p>
<p>The last level in our approach is that we look in detail at the opportunities that SEPA brings to companies. Will it make the business case good enough to establish this shared service centre they have talked about? Could they centralise liquidity management or go in for one treasury now? There are a handful of clear benefits, and we’re assessing these with all our strategic customers.</p>
<h5 id="can-we-have-a-look-at-the-other-changes-that-are-talking-place-in-the-european-treasury-landscape">Can we have a look at the other changes that are talking place in the European treasury landscape?</h5>
<p>At the top of the agenda is, of course, the financial turmoil. Treasurers are finding that they need to prepare for tougher times. They have a higher funding cost and they need to be very scarce with their liquidity.</p>
<p>For most corporates, the topic of expanding into Eastern Europe and Asia to support the business is another main theme.</p>
<p>Working capital is another important area. You need to be very efficient with your own capital, and that is something that everybody is looking at, together with liquidity forecasting. Corporates have become more efficient with their liquidity planning and liquidity usage, and they are more focused on handling liquidity optimally compared to a couple of years ago, when the economy was still booming and they had to focus on other things.</p>
<p>And then the area of operational efficiency is something that treasurers talk a lot about. How could we have one pipeline to our main bank or main banks, host-to-host? How could we use only one electronic banking system? How could we improve STP ratios to be as efficient as other processes within the company? Aside from SEPA and the financial turmoil, corporates still need to stay competitive in the global environment.</p>
<h5 id="how-is-seb-responding-to-these-trends">How is SEB responding to these trends?</h5>
<p>It’s always important to talk to your customers and it’s even more important now because even the largest banks really need to ensure that they are doing the right thing from an investment perspective. SEPA forces banks to understand what role they have to play in a SEPA environment, but even if you take a defensive approach, it still requires a lot of investment. If you decide to outsource, you still need to clean up before you can do that – and you need to be sure that you take the right decisions, because you will not have enough investment capacity to make another try. I think that really trying to understand customers’ priorities – geography versus system upgrades versus full steam ahead on SEPA – is very important.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s always important to talk to your customers and it’s even more important now because even the largest banks really need to ensure that they are doing the right thing from an investment perspective.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For us, in the Nordics, it’s also a matter of how long corporates will continue to invest in EDIFACT. The Nordics is a very EDIFACT-intensive area, and we need to understand what the future looks like for corporates in three, five and eight years’ time. Meanwhile, geographical reach is becoming more important year by year and we are focused on looking for partnerships in different regions – such as Asia and parts of Eastern Europe – to be able to supply our customers with one point of contact.</p>
<p>We have also upgraded our web forecast application for liquidity forecasting. Liquidity forecasting has been on the agenda for many years but for most people this has been an exercise in Excel spreadsheets. It’s starting to become so core now, fuelled by the financial turmoil, so we see this as a very important area.</p>
<p>Finally, we really believe in our approach, the Cash Management Value Chain™. This means being very pragmatic and hands-on, talking to customers, staff in accounts payable and receivable and logistics people in order to understand exactly how the liquidity and working capital moves in the company. It’s very basic but it’s extremely important to be able to optimise most of what we have talked about.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>This month we talk to Akbar Dhala and Tim Decker about what HSBC is doing in the SWIFT arena and other areas for the benefit of its corporate clients.</p>
<div class="biography right vcard person n1">
<h4 class="fn">Tim Decker</h4>
<h5 class="title">Senior Product Manager, Head of e-Channels</h5>
<img alt="HSBC" class="logo org" height="18" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/hsbc-logo-2008-100x18.png" width="100"/>

<h4 class="fn">Akbar Dhala</h4>
<h5 class="title">Head of Product Management, Payments and Cash Management</h5>
<img alt="HSBC" class="logo org" height="18" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/hsbc-logo-2008-100x18.png" width="100"/>

</div>
<h5 id="can-we-start-by-outlining-hsbcs-strategy-in-the-swift-arena-with-regard-to-its-corporate-clients">Can we start by outlining HSBC’s strategy in the SWIFT arena with regard to its corporate clients?</h5>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span>Akbar Dhala:</span> I would like to answer this question from an overall strategic position rather than focusing on SWIFT specifically because SWIFT, whilst an important component from a corporate perspective, is only part of the overall picture. Our strategy in the corporate space has remained consistent, but what I would say is that in the current environment the client relationship is very much ‘centre of plate’ for us. We are focused on three key themes right now:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>SEPA and how we harness its introduction for the benefit of our clients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The roll-out of our Global Liquidity Solution (GLS) will provide market leading solutions for multicurrency pooling and cash concentration.</p>
<p>Customer Benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Improved working capital management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treasury automation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Global product consistency</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Visibility and control of cash</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Solutions for highly regulated markets</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>SWIFT connectivity for corporates.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Essentially we continue to focus on our customers’ needs. We try to anticipate their objectives and aims around centralisation, increased automation and STP rates, integration with their back office systems, improved visibility of cash, re-engineering of processes, bank relationships and multi-bank connectivity.</p>
<p>We take ‘Voice Of Customer’ (VOC) very seriously at HSBC as evidenced by the establishment of our Strategic Visionary Forum (SVF), where selected clients are invited to share their visions and ambitions in the transaction banking arena. We then use the output of these forums to inform and drive our product development. We are also sponsoring the Corporate Access stream at this year’s SIBOS in Vienna and this will also be a major theme at EuroFinance in Barcelona in October.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>Tim Decker:</span> I would add that now is a good time for us, as a number of external factors such as SEPA and the Payment Services Directive (PSD) are acting as catalysts for change. We are pro-actively assisting our clients to harness the benefits of these initiatives. Many of our clients have already re-engineered, or are planning to re-engineer, their back offices and this in turn leads to a fundamental review of file formatting protocols and connectivity issues. These projects frequently require us to develop a suite of propositions in response.</p>
<p>As far as SWIFT is concerned, we are supporting the Treasury Counterparty (TRCO) access method, SCORE, MA-CUG, SWIFT bureau and Alliance Lite alongside both FIN and FileAct. This strategy enables us to satisfy the needs of our corporate clients in the SWIFT arena, whether they are a major Multinational Corporation (MNC), large corporation, non-bank financial institution or Mid Market Enterprise (MME)/Small Market Enterprise (SME) client.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="is-this-your-view-too-or-is-hsbc-seeing-a-different-take-up-by-its-corporate-clients">It is often stated that SWIFT is only a viable solution for the very largest corporations and there are only a handful of companies actually accessing SWIFT today. Is this your view too or is HSBC seeing a different take up by its corporate clients?</h5>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>TD:</span> I alluded to this in my earlier answer but it is worth emphasising. We have taken a conscious decision to support a range of solutions which enable our clients to use SWIFT. This approach appeals to a large part of our customer base, not just the very large MNCs with huge transactional volumes. For this reason, we are seeing more and more of our clients considering SWIFT.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span>AD:</span> I agree – we are seeing a growing number of companies actually accessing SWIFT today and our dialogue with existing and potential clients very often includes detailed discussions on the connectivity options, which inevitably includes SWIFT. As an example, many of our larger clients use our host-to-host solution to connect to the bank. This solution is now evolving into a direct access model using one of the methods Tim mentioned earlier.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>TD:</span> I would also like to add that certain external factors are helping to drive clients down the SWIFT road. One such example is the ETEBAC standard commonly adopted in France, which is being phased out and could be replaced with SWIFT.</p>
<p>Although the development of EBICs (Electronic Banking Internet Communication Standard) in Germany could provide a rival solution for the French Corporates.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="can-you-summarise-hsbcs-approach-to-the-various-access-options-available-to-the-corporate">Can you summarise HSBC’s approach to the various access options available to the corporate?</h5>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span>AD:</span> Tim covered the various options we support earlier so I would like to pick up specifically on the SWIFT service bureau option because we are seeing huge potential here. We have developed a relationship with one of the major service bureaus and we are looking at ways of delivering real value to our clients. In essence we are focusing on addressing the connectivity issues mentioned earlier and developing ‘any-to-any’ mapping tools. However, our approach is to look beyond pure connectivity and use value-added technology solutions and the power of HSBC’s worldwide footprint to provide our customers with a global treasury, payables and receivables solution which can be integrated seamlessly into the back-office, delivering end-to-end straight through processing. The solution has been expanded to include elements such as AML filtering capabilities, MT940/942/900/910 feeds, as well as a reconciliations package that allows the client to migrate from individual transaction reconciliation to reporting by exception only.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>TD:</span> The decision taken by the client with regard to SWIFT access focuses on three key drivers:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Cost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Volume.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complexity.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Because of our decision to support the full suite of access options, we can help our clients make an informed decision on which route is the most appropriate for them.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="which-traditionally-has-been-a-closed-communications-messaging-network-among-the-banking-community">Do you feel dis-intermediated as a result of corporates being given access to SWIFT, which traditionally has been a closed communications/messaging network among the banking community?</h5>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span>AD:</span> No, absolutely not; quite the opposite in fact. HSBC, as one of the largest users of SWIFT globally, has an exceptional relationship with SWIFT and, as such, we work hand-in-glove with the people at SWIFT. We also sponsor Universwiftnet, a series of one day conferences for Corporates on how to use SWIFT and associated solutions, with events scheduled for 2009 in Paris, London, Germany, Madrid and Milan, with around 1000 delegates expected to attend. We see big opportunities rather than increased cost and/or threats and we continue to work with and lobby SWIFT for the benefit of the industry as a whole.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-additional-services-around-corporate-access-is-hsbc-providing-as-a-means-of-competitive-advantage">In the context of SEPA, we hear a lot about Additional Optional Services or AOS – what additional services around corporate access is HSBC providing as a means of competitive advantage?</h5>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span>AD:</span> I mentioned the SWIFT bureau service earlier and it is in this space that we are focusing on developing competitive advantage, whether the corporate takes the MA-CUG or SCORE route.</p>
<p>We have developed an enhanced Application Service Provider (ASP) proposition within the bureau offering – a ‘one-stop’ shop with HSBC. We have already deployed the solution in the UK and have plans to commercialise this globally over the next year or so.</p>
<p>So, how does our approach add value beyond corporate access? In essence, I would say our solution puts connectivity to work for the client. Our modular approach, using best in class components, allows the client to build out from a foundation of SWIFT connectivity to include: data mapping from/to legacy back office formats; overnight, intraday or real-time reconciliations and exception reporting; filtering and capture of payments against AML check-lists; bulking of payments into cost-effective ACH-formatted files; use of SWIFTnet FIN and FileAct to connect to banking partners. We have even integrated a market-leading Treasury Management System into our solution, to enhance even further the already rich functionality of our SWIFT connectivity offering.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n2">
<p>Commercially, all of this is offered as a bundled solution via a single contract with HSBC, whilst minimising absolutely the need for capital expenditure on the part of the client – I like to think of this as real insourcing in action. We are also devoting some considerable effort to the Alliance Lite proposition as we have a huge base of SME/MME clients for which this solution has attractions.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>TD:</span> I would add that our competitive advantage can be summarised as delivering technology integration, plus connectivity, plus core banking. This is a compelling argument and our clients are responding favourably to this approach. Our Payments Managed Service offered through our bureau highlights this approach, whereby we utilise ‘best of breed’ partners for back office payments processing and offer solutions ranging from file capture, billing, AML payments screening and high/low value payments to warehousing, SEPA compliance and liquidity management. We are offering a managed service as opposed to an installed solution so our solution is effectively ‘pay as you go’ and ‘pay as you grow’ and consequently cash flow positive.</p>
<p>The solution is future proof, SEPA compliant, scaleable, uses SWIFT as a secure delivery channel, has full transaction audit trails and all contracting is undertaken with HSBC. We view this as a real differentiator. If you would like to find out more please visit our exhibition stand at the EuroFinance Conference in Barcelona 1<sup>st</sup>–3<sup>rd</sup> October.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="how-would-you-see-the-corporate-swift-landscape-in-say-five-years">Finally, if we had a crystal ball here today, how would you see the corporate SWIFT landscape in say five years?</h5>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span>AD:</span> I predict we will see even more technology integration and centralisation of processes, with connectivity continuing to be a major theme. I think we will see SWIFT drilling much deeper into the Middle Market space. I think we will also witness a major migration to the XML and ISO20022 standards.</p>
<p>The regulatory environment with SEPA and the PSD will continue to drive change and this will inevitably result in more corporates accessing SWIFT as they re-engineer in response. The return on investment (ROI) is compelling for corporates: 200–300% in some cases.</p>
<p>I think SWIFT will also evolve as an enabler for the financial supply chain and, for me, this can only result in a win-win situation.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>TD:</span> I agree and would also add that we will see an increase in demand for real-time information. SWIFT prides itself on its resilience and security and these are fundamental attributes when dealing with financial data. Might we see corporates transferring information between each other using SWIFT within the next five years? Why not!</p>

<p>Jasper Savelkoel has a masters degree in macro-economics from Erasmus University Rotterdam (EUR), The Netherlands, as well as an Executive MBA from University of Antwerp Management School (UAMS), Belgium. Jasper’s professional career at KBC Bank spans 15 years. He has worked in the Trade Finance area as Trade Finance Officer and within Merchant Banking as a Relationship Manager Corporate and General Manager Corporate. He has held the latter role within both KBC Bank Belgium and KBC Bank The Netherlands.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-can-you-tell-us-about-kbcs-corporate-banking-strategy">What can you tell us about KBC’s corporate banking strategy?</h5>
<p>KBC Group is what we call a multi-local independent bancassurance group, ie a bank which offers insurance as well as banking products. We hold leading positions in the Central European banking markets as well as in our home market of Belgium, and we also offer full service branch networks in many Western European countries, South East Asia and the US.</p>
<p>KBC Group has approximately 60,000 employees, while our customer figures around the world amount to around 13 million. These are not only corporate customers, but also private customers, as well as many small and medium-sized enterprises. We operate with a multi-brand strategy, so in each of our different locations we may appear under different brands: KBC Bank in Western Europe, Serbia, US and Asia Pacific, K&amp;H Bank in Hungary, CSOB in the Czech Republic, Kredytbank in Poland, EIBank in Bulgaria and Absolut Banka in Russia.</p>
<p>As a bancassurance company, we are able to offer not only banking products but insurance products too. Looking at the corporate activities, we provide a full range of products and services to domestic and international companies within and across our geographical markets.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the commitment we have shown to banking in Central Europe can be seen in the €7 billion we have so far invested to achieve a prominent position in this emerging market, as well as the significant investments we are planning in the coming years to expand our presence in the region.</p>
<h5 id="how-exactly-are-you-looking-to-expand">How exactly are you looking to expand?</h5>
<p>There are actually two ways in which we seek expansion. Firstly, by growing the market share of the countries where we already have a leading presence – such as the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia and Hungary. The second strategy, which we recently followed, was what we like to call a ‘next round’ in Central and Eastern Europe, having last year acquired Russia’s Absolut Bank, EIBank in Bulgaria and Serbia’s A Banka, which has been rebranded as KBC Serbia.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-the-key-trends-you-are-seeing-in-the-market">What are the key trends you are seeing in the market?</h5>
<p>I would say that one of the trends we are seeing today is that there is an increasing level of pan-European competition between banks. I believe that this is partly due to the fact that SEPA is gaining momentum – not so much in terms of its market acceptance, but more in terms of the market preparing itself strategically. As such, this is leading to pressures on transaction fees within the liquidity management services.</p>
<p>We see a lot of global banks coming downwards to local markets and we see some efforts from domestic banks pushing up their activities to adjacent markets, so there’s a lot of movement. KBC’s position is quite interesting and presents us with a lot of opportunities. By being multi-local, we are close to our corporate customers while at the same time offering them global reach. I think we have a unique position and an interesting proposition for our customers.</p>
<p>The liquidity crisis at the moment presents an opportunity for our liquidity management services. The centralisation of cash is becoming a standard for operational excellence in liquidity management. Corporate customers are increasingly asking for regional or even pan-European liquidity management solutions. As a result, liquidity management products have become a main anchor in the bank-to-corporate relationship. From our perspective, and also from a corporate perspective, I believe this is a good thing, as having a strong relationship and liquidity management solutions in place typically increases the duration of the commercial relationship.</p>
<h5 id="what-sort-of-impact-do-you-think-this-crisis-is-having-on-your-corporate-clients">What sort of impact do you think this crisis is having on your corporate clients?</h5>
<p>Well, that’s the hard part. For one thing, they will pay considerably more for their funding. At the same time, more and more banks pitch the concept of relationship lending instead of transaction lending towards their corporate clients.</p>
<h5 id="how-would-you-differentiate-between-these">How would you differentiate between these?</h5>
<p>During times of high liquidity, there is a trend for companies of all risk profiles to have easy access to new money, refinancing their existing obligations, etc. But that is no longer the case in this type of market. As long as the bank has a long-standing and established relationship with the corporate customer, it is probably true that it will continue to finance the corporate needs. But I would say that the true transactional lending has diminished now. In short, banks will require a relationship to lend, so it is key to corporates to invest in their bank relationships.</p>
<p>My personal opinion is that we are not at the end of the liquidity crisis yet, so this aspect will continue to impact the market for a considerable period.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-your-views-on-sepa-today">What are your views on SEPA today?</h5>
<p>An end date for non-SEPA domestic payment products really would be helpful to enforce market acceptance of SEPA and SEPA instruments. Personally, I would like to see a date established sometime around 2011-2012, but the sooner the better. That way, transition between the old legacy domestic instruments and the new SEPA ones could be as short as possible – something which is in the interests of both corporate customers and banks alike.</p>
<p>However, what I still see today is a lack of readiness and awareness towards the opportunities SEPA could offer. If you talk to corporate treasurers, they don’t seem to know what they should do, or even if they should do anything at all.</p>
<p>In addition, market acceptance of the SEPA Direct Debit (SDD) scheme seems to be endangered. This will remain for as long as the Payments Service Directive implementation and national transpositions remain unsure, and the bank-to-bank schemes and electronic mandates for the SDD are under heavy debate. The SDD is a major building block of the realisation of SEPA, but as long as it is not clear, there will still be a long way to go.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, take-up of the SEPA Credit Transfer (SCT) instrument is very slow, with our statistics indicating that only 1.5% of all credit transfers processed by KBC are SCTs. This is still higher than the take-up in the market overall, which is around 0.5%.</p>
<h5 id="thats-very-low">That’s very low.</h5>
<p>This is the reality. Another observation is the fact that as delivery of XML ISO 20022 standards is on track, at the same time we will start seeing national opt-outs, meaning that the risk of a ‘mini-SEPA’ will become evident. The risk is that we might have one single payment instrument, which remains subject to various inputs instead of one standardised input – the opposite of SEPA’s ambition.</p>
<h5 id="what-do-you-see-as-the-longer-term-prospects">What do you see as the longer term prospects?</h5>
<p>Well, the longer term prospect is that corporate customers who decrease their number of accounts will probably decrease their number of banking relationships too, or alternatively centralise all the cash they hold during the day throughout their international operations into a few accounts end of day. But it won’t happen all at once. Companies are likely to first centralise their account payables by means of payment factories. In a second stage accounts receivable will follow.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that a lot of EU payment instruments will remain outside the scope of SEPA. Cheques and cash remain considerable parts of the payment industry in Europe and are likely to remain so. In addition, the XML-based bank-to-customer reporting is still not in place and is an important means for companies to reconcile their pan-European payment transactions, plus the SDD is delayed until November 2009 at the earliest. As a consequence, we will probably have a period of both SEPA and domestic formats persisting until 2015, and a market where banks will aggressively cross-sell their payment products.</p>
<p>A substantial number of small and midcap corporates will try to establish straight through processing (STP) and reconciliation of payments in connection to their ERP systems. This is also still in the beginning of development, because companies have to adjust their ERP systems in order to make sure that they can process SEPA instruments on the basis of new XML standards. So the corporate reality today is that there is still a lot of manual processing of transactions and subsequent reconciliations within the corporate book-keeping system.</p>
<p>What we also think is that companies will request banks not only to manage their cash in, let’s say, the SEPA market, but also in the more emerging markets, for example, going further eastwards in Europe where we experience increasing demand for basic cash management solutions.</p>
<h5 id="what-would-you-say-is-kbcs-competitive-advantage-in-a-harmonised-european-payment-market">Moving on from SEPA, what would you say is KBC’s competitive advantage in a harmonised European payment market?</h5>
<p>To start with, I would like to say we have identified three important drivers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first is that in the future large uniform European payment market, corporate customers will need banks to be near to them. At the same time, they want their banks to help them increase STP rates for bank transactions and reporting as much as possible. Our strategy is to offer and develop standardised products across all our banks, like web-based e-banking and e-reporting, to facilitate the STP needs of our international corporate customers, at the same time ensuring that we are near to them, thereby maintaining a strong &amp; open, operational and strategic relationship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the other hand, the high cost of ownership will force customers to optimise (ie most likely decrease) the number of banking relationships per geographical region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, we believe that long-term relationship lending is key to both banks and corporate customers, and we are offering that to our clients. Cash management products are instrumental here as they typically increase the duration of commercial relationships by more than 25%.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of what KBC is offering to facilitate these three things, we apply a customer relationship model that, to my belief, is truly customer centric and delivers on commitment. For example, if a corporate customer wants to open an account with any branch of KBC Bank throughout Europe and have remote access to it, we can do this in two weeks and in a standardised, uniform way. This is the bread and butter of liquidity management products, because if you cannot open up an account and install all necessary electronic banking and one-on-one services, you cannot start banking with the corporate customer.</p>
<p>We have also applied a single pricing model across all countries. This really helps to service customers as we like to bank with them in a number of countries. In addition, as a founding member of IBOS (the International Banking One Solution organisation) – in countries where we have insufficient coverage – we can team up with one of the 12 major local banks involved, offering the full range of cash management products, from remote account opening to zero-balancing cash pooling solutions.</p>
<p>We attach much value to local market know-how. Central European markets sometimes differ completely in terms of payment instruments and different payment behaviour. That’s why KBC Group works to have a strong local presence – with around 75 corporate branches in our European home markets. That‘s what our customers appreciate – a one-stop shop for all your needs.</p>
<p>We really focus on this by having one single electronic banking system called w1se Corporate E-banking – a multi-bank, multi-format application which enables customers to manage their accounts, transactions and reporting across KBC as well as other banks. No need for any other e-banking application. And it’s important because market studies show that maintaining several e-banking applications is a costly corporate expense. So, they have an incentive to decrease the number of those applications. KBC is also one of the first banks worldwide to offer full SCORE compliant MA-CUG – SWIFT for Corporates solutions.</p>
<h5 id="are-you-seeing-much-take-up-of-this-w1se-corporate-e-banking-tool">Are you seeing much take-up of this w1se corporate e-banking tool?</h5>
<p>Definitely, especially for the international companies that require services in multiple countries. As it is web-based, irrespective of where you are within your treasury organisation, it acts as a ‘one application fits all’ in terms of geography, transactions and reporting. In fact, KBC Group hosts all of its electronic banking tools to manage corporate customer’s day-to-day treasury and trade finance operations in its single portal at www.kbcmerchantbanking.com. We feel that this experience, together with a customer-centric, relationship banking model that delivers in daily life, is the real reason why companies select us.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>This month we talk to Stefan Wloch of Commerzbank about developments in Trade Finance and Transaction Services.</p>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Stefan Wloch</h4>
<h5 class="title">Head of Global Product Management &amp; Development</h5>
<img alt="Commerzbank" class="logo org" height="15" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/commerzbank-logo-2008-150x15.png" width="150"/>
<p>Stefan Wloch is responsible for product management and development of Commerzbank’s trade finance and transaction services. He is based at Commerzbank’s headquarters in Frankfurt am Main. He started his career at Deutsche Bank and joined Commerzbank in 1990. During his 18 years with Commerzbank, he has worked on the banking business side and also held technical positions within IT.</p>
<p>In 2006 he returned to the product management side – first as project leader and then as Head of Global Product Management and Development – where he benefits from his thorough understanding of both the banking business and the underlying IT business to manage and develop new products.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="area-of-responsibility-as-head-of-global-product-management-and-development">What is your area of responsibility as Head of Global Product Management and Development?</h5>
<p>Within Corporate Banking I am in charge of product management and development of all our trade finance and transaction service business. This covers, for example, the field of domestic and foreign payments for all of Commerzbank’s operating units, which includes anything from credit transfers, direct debits and cheques to SEPA.</p>
<p>I am responsible for cash and liquidity management products, cash flow dispositions, cash pooling products and the internal systems that we need for this – not only in Europe, but wherever Commerzbank operates with its own units. For all these systems my group commissions the applications that are needed from our own IT department. This means that we define the requirements and functionalities and subsequently implement any innovations and technical developments in corresponding projects.</p>
<p>Other areas of responsibility are corporate cards and point of sale.</p>
<p>Cash collection and cash supply services are also an important part of transaction services. Here we also have a subsidiary, SOLTRX Transaction Services GmbH, which manages cash collection and distribution for large retail stores and other businesses that rely on cash transactions.</p>
<p>On the trade finance side we do anything related to the documentary credit business such as letters of credit, guarantees or export and import collections. These are all products we are responsible for and that we develop further. The applications used in trade finance are also strongly reliant on technology, albeit to a lesser extent than those employed in transaction services. The standardisation of data formats in trade finance in general is unfortunately not yet on the level that has been attained in payments and cash management. We do however offer the ability to open and manage letters of credits online with our Trade Finance module.</p>
<p>Finally, my team is responsible for IT front-end systems. These are software applications that Commerzbank provides to its customers on a standalone basis or through its corporate banking portal. This includes, for example, client specific software developments or applications like our Treasury module, which is an ASP treasury management system available via our portal. We are also involved with issues like internet encryption, electronic signatures and customer-to-bank interfaces.</p>
<h5 id="what-do-you-do-as-far-as-programming-is-concerned">What do you do as far as programming is concerned?</h5>
<p>My team will outline the technical specifications and functionalities and instruct our IT department to either purchase or develop the software program. IT will decide whether to acquire the appropriate tool from a software provider or to write the program internally.</p>
<h5 id="how-much-is-being-puchased-and-developed">Can you quantify how much is being purchased and how much is developed by your own IT?</h5>
<p>There are two product lines which have been developed externally. On the one hand there is COTEL, our domestic electronic banking tool, also known as MultiCash in the market. This has been developed by Omikron and is licensed via the Association of German Banks. On the other hand there is our Treasury module, which we have bought externally from ecofinance Finanzsoftware &amp; Consulting GmbH. The remainder of the internet portal has been developed entirely by our own IT.</p>
<p>With regard to our back-end systems it is always a mixture of the two. There are software providers that offer solutions, but these will have to be customised and adapted to the existing systems environment at Commerzbank. This is also generally the source of high IT expenditures.</p>
<h5 id="is-new-product-development-generally-the-result-of-customer-demand">Is new product development generally the result of customer demand?</h5>
<p>Yes, we either determine what our customers require through surveys and market analyses or we derive this demand directly from our sales department. This is helped by our organisational structure which extends TFTS (Trade Finance and Transaction Services) sales across all operating units worldwide.</p>
<h5 id="is-this-refelcted-by-your-personal-background">In a way you link the banking and IT arms at Commerzbank. Is this reflected by your personal background?</h5>
<p>Very much so. I began as a banker before embarking on an 18 month trainee programme that had the objective of providing a thorough understanding of the banking business as well as the underlying IT. I subsequently held technical positions in electronic banking and introduced our product COTEL at Commerzbank years ago. I was also involved as project assistant in the implementation of Eurocard services before I switched to the business side in 1995 as a product manager for all software and file transfer products of the bank.</p>
<p>Four years later I returned as team head of the electronic banking hotline for corporate customers and at the same time served as the right hand to the IT millennium project leader. After the project was finalised I headed a group which functioned as the point of call for all departments in terms of IT production. At the same time I was in charge of a project taking stock of all applications that needed to be adapted as a result of the euro introduction.</p>
<p>In 2006 I returned to the product management side first as project leader and then as Head of Global Product Management and Development. I am therefore familiar with the banking business and the IT side and my role is precisely what my initial training aimed for.</p>
<h5 id="what-technical-developments-and-innovations-are-you-currently-seeing-in-trade-finance-and-transaction-services">What technical developments and innovations are you currently seeing in Trade Finance and Transaction Services?</h5>
<p>Only last year we introduced a unique form of authentication for our web portal in the form of a USB stick that does not require any installation. This stick is perfectly secure and includes an electronic signature for the authorisation of payments so that all the services of our corporate banking portal become available from anywhere in the world where our customers have access to the internet. The stick also offers our customers the ability to structure the authorisation of payment transactions with separate signatures from different locations.</p>
<p>Our corporate banking portal continues to be the only multi-bank-capable internet banking portal by making use of the German EBICS (Electronic Banking Internet Communication Standard) format. As a result our customers can reach any EBICS-ready bank in Germany through the payment module of our portal as well as other banks worldwide.</p>
<p>Another interesting project has come in conjunction with the introduction of SEPA. We were asked by one of our customers, the Würth Group, to support their ramp-up-project for the implementation of the new SAP modules ‘Bank Communication Management’ and ‘Integration Package for SWIFT’ in order to gain access to SWIFTNet via a MA-CUG administered by us. This was a unique project as it was the first launch of this new SAP module. Despite a very short turnaround time the project has been a resounding success, not least due to the strong commitment of Würth Group. The interface and SWIFT connection were then also used by Würth to send one of our first SEPA Credit Transfers on January 28<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>And SEPA itself of course requires a number of new developments in terms of the SEPA Credit Transfer that we have just introduced and the SEPA Direct Debit that will follow soon.</p>
<h5 id="how-is-commerzbank-positioned-in-this-space">Speaking of SEPA, how is Commerzbank positioned in this space?</h5>
<p>We have adapted our internal structures, processes and platforms in time for the introduction of the SEPA Credit Transfer and fulfilled all the necessary SEPA requirements. In addition, COTEL is SEPA-ready which means that all our applications were SEPA-ready on January 28<sup>th</sup> this year.</p>
<p>Leading up to SEPA we organised numerous events, during which we informed our corporate customers about SEPA and what it means for them. At the end of last year we conducted a survey among 600 corporate customers asking them how satisfied they were with the information that we provided on SEPA. We were very pleased to learn that 79% of corporates felt that their information needs on SEPA had been met or exceeded.</p>
<p>Another question is whether these companies themselves were ready for SEPA in January 2008 and here we found that two thirds of the companies were not and are not ready for SEPA yet. However, I don‘t see this as a problem. SEPA will certainly have benefits, but companies will have to invest into the consolidation and adaptation of their systems to make use of the new formats. Currently nothing really dictates that companies will have to do so as long as existing formats are not being phased out.</p>
<h5 id="sepa-direct-debit-give-an-additional-impetus">Will the SEPA Direct Debit give an additional impetus?</h5>
<p>We will have to wait until the Payment Services Directive has been implemented into national law but the SEPA Direct Debit will certainly have the benefit that the fixed and transparent time-frames of the scheme will make it easier for corporates to plan ahead. So it is possible that we will see more demand but it will be crucial for large debit collectors like insurance companies how the question of mandates is going to be resolved. If the SEPA Direct Debit required the issuing of new direct debit mandates, this will become a huge burden for companies that currently are extensive users of direct debits.</p>
<p>However, SEPA will have many benefits such as a uniform regulatory framework across Europe which creates more transparency. Clearly defined and binding execution times will enable more efficient cash flow management.</p>
<h5 id="demand-for-sepa">What has the demand for SEPA been like so far?</h5>
<p>There has not been a massive run on SEPA in our experience yet. We are of course prepared if companies want to use SEPA Credit Transfers. We expect an increase in demand in the second half of 2008 and particularly later in 2009.</p>
<h5 id="current-trends-in-transaction-services">What current trends are you seeing in transaction services?</h5>
<p>One trend I can see is a more extensive use of the electronic banking standard EBICS – initially within Germany and in the medium term even across Europe. I believe EBICS has a good opportunity to become a European e-banking standard as France, the Netherlands and Austria have already expressed their interest in it. This would be a great development and it would cover a very large part of Europe.</p>
<p>Another trend I can see coming from our corporate customers is customer-to-bank straight through processing. The level of automation in the transfer of information between customer and bank can be increased as there are still some discontinuities of media in this area. This customer-to-bank interface has also been somewhat neglected as far as SEPA formats are concerned and there is currently a drive to establish a uniform format.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the topics of liquidity management and daily disposition of cash flows continue to be pertinent issues for our customers.</p>
<h5 id="how-does-commerzbank-differentiate-itself-from-competition-in-trade-finance-and-transaction-services">How does Commerzbank differentiate itself from competition in Trade Finance and Transaction Services?</h5>
<p>We are different in terms of our organisational structure in the sense that sales of Trade Finance and Transaction Services are globally managed from Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Trade finance is one of our core businesses where we have extensive knowledge. The documentary credit business, where we have a market share of 18%, plays a very important role and it is also a strong income generator. We are different from our competition in terms of our proximity to our customers. We maintain 21 locations in our documentary credit business throughout Germany and in each operative branch from an international perspective. Our results show that this is a successful strategy.</p>
<p>Further unique characteristics of the foreign business include our Trade Finance tool, which can be used to open, amend and manage letters of credit and guarantees online, as well as our value for doc service. With value for doc, Commerzbank assumes a range of tasks related to the generation and management of documents on behalf of its clients, either to support them at peak times or to relieve them of tasks they no longer can or want to do themselves.</p>
<p>Our corporate banking portal is another important differentiator. We are the only bank offering USB stick authentication in the field of trade finance and transaction services and, as I mentioned earlier, we are also the only bank offering a multi-bank capable portal based on the EBICS standard.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>This month Naveed Sultan from Citi talks about the current credit crisis and makes observations about various global trends. He also provides some insights on how organisations can respond to today’s challenges and opportunities.</p>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Naveed Sultan</h4>
<h5 class="title">Head of Global Transaction Services Europe, Middle East and Africa</h5>
<img alt="Citi" class="logo org" height="29" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/citi-logo-2010-50x29.png" width="50"/>
<p>Naveed Sultan is the Head of Global Transactions Services (GTS) for Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) at Citi. In his role, Naveed is responsible for Treasury and Trade Solutions, and Securities and Fund Services across the region.</p>
<p>Prior to his appointment to his current role in October 2007, Naveed was Head of Cash Management and Treasury Services for GTS in EMEA. Naveed joined Citi with Saudi American Bank (SAMBA), an affiliate of Citibank, in 1993 where he held several senior positions including Global Transaction Banking Group Head and Senior Country Operations Officer. In 1999, he became the business head for Citi’s Cash and Trade product groups in Western Europe, based in London. In August 2003, he was appointed Head of Cash Management in EMEA when Western Europe and CEEMEA were combined to form one region. Before joining Saudi American Bank, Naveed was the Country Corporate Banking Head for Standard Chartered Bank in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Naveed holds an M.S. in Management from M.I.T’s Sloan School of Management as well as an M.B.A. from the University of Punjab in Pakistan.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-are-you-seeing-your-customers-doing-in-these-difficult-times">What are you seeing your customers doing in these difficult times?</h5>
<p>We are seeing most corporate clients drawing on the liquidity that has been accumulated in the last few years to finance their internal needs as and when needed. Clients are taking a more conservative view to financing their internal needs considering that there is pressure on the credit that is available in the market.</p>
<p>The role which we play as Global Transaction Services (GTS) is that we help corporations, particularly multinationals, to become more efficient in their cash management, where they have distributed business models around the world and their liquidity happens to be in different geographic jurisdictions, or in different business entities globally. The treasurer and the CFO want to ensure that they have the right visibility on the cash that is sitting in their system and we help them achieve this.</p>
<p>More and more, we are working with our clients to create end-to-end treasury solutions that mobilise liquidity so they can make optimal business decisions around that liquidity, in borrowing and investments. At Citi, that’s what our focus is and we’ve been working on those solutions with our clients for a while now.</p>
<h5 id="cash-has-never-been-more-important">Cash has never been more important.</h5>
<p>Yes, and this is an opportunity for us to help our clients unlock the trapped liquidity in their businesses around the world, and provide them with the infrastructure to fund and work through the financial supply chain. Globally, we can help them tie up the different bits and pieces, different ends of their business entities or a financial or a commercial flow. If we are able to do that within one institution, I think that really helps our clients improve their working capital cycle.</p>
<p>The markets have been flush with liquidity over many years, but the tide is turning now, and inter-bank liquidity has become severely tightened. As a result, we are seeing corporations looking at their own internal liquidity, drawing upon their cash positions with multiple banks.</p>
<h5 id="the-inter-bank-and-credit-markets">Some observers describe the inter-bank and credit markets as being frozen.</h5>
<p>Not really frozen, but it’s really become much more expensive. Banks are holding onto their own liquidity to make sure they are able to fund their own client base. Since these banks have very long-standing relationships with their clients and these clients do business with them across multiple products, functional areas and geographies, the top priority of the banks is to continue to fund their own clients first.</p>
<p>Whatever is left, you go and lend into the market. But the issue is that banks are becoming a little more conservative because the outlook is uncertain, and when a situation like that happens, you want to tighten your belt a little. That is naturally creating a dearth of funding in the inter-bank market.</p>
<h5 id="how-long-do-you-think-until-it-gets-better">How long do you think until it gets better?</h5>
<p>I think it will take a while before it settles down. I think it is a phase. You’re seeing action by the regulators, the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England easing the interest rates and providing greater liquidity in the inter-bank market. Part of it is that this is the reality; another part is the psychological impact on the industry where the banks become more conservative than the actual risks tend to suggest. These things should stabilise. But if you want to put a time frame on it, I think it’s very difficult to say.</p>
<p>At Citi, we have a very strong capital base and we have a good liquidity position. We obviously are closely monitoring intraday credit, so being more selective in our funding decisions, but we are working with our clients to ensure they are being supported.</p>
<h5 id="emerging-markets">Emerging markets seem to present some significant opportunities.</h5>
<p>Emerging markets grow in cycles, which we believe are very broad and deep and there’s certainly a 15- to 20-year cycle that is impacting every asset class and commodity pricing. And this emerging market cycle – which is really in markets like India, China, the Middle East and Russia – results from the globalisation of trade flows and the shift of the economic centre of gravity to the east. You can call it the industrial revolution of our times.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is somewhat de-coupling of the global economy from the US economy. Historically, if the US economy sneezed, the rest of the world used to catch a cold, as the saying goes. But I think this time around, there are markets like China, India and Russia, who may have significant trade flows into the US, but also have flows with the rest of the world. So they have really become key players in terms of the growth as well as the US.</p>
<p>So, if the US economy were to slow down further, we should have some shock absorbers due to this distributed economic activity around the world, which may not plunge the globe into as deep an economic recession as would have been the case a few years ago.</p>
<h5 id="globalisation-of-trade-has-played-to-your-strengths-as-a-bank">Globalisation of trade has played to your strengths as a bank.</h5>
<p>Being the most global bank, we are able to facilitate flows at both ends of the supply chain because of our integrated technology platforms and distribution network. And we have seen, in many cases, as these clients go and enter into new markets, we are there to help them and it’s just an extension of an operating and business model or a treasury model which we might have put in place for them.</p>
<p>We are also seeing the emergence of large local corporations who are increasingly coming out of China, Russia and India, for example. We expect to see many of these companies develop into the larger global corporations in the world. There are many examples you can talk about. Look at MittalArcelor, now the world’s number-one steel company, or the Tata Group, growing through its recent acquisition of Jaguar/Landrover. These are just a couple of examples out of India, but there are many others.</p>
<p>We are also seeing the big multinationals such as Shell and IBM pushing further out into the emerging markets, and in many cases, we are already there to assist them. If not, we have the appetite to expand into new markets with our clients, establish an on-the-ground presence and provide them with global solutions to support their growth plans.</p>
<p>As a result of this growth, we are seeing a tremendous amount of wealth creation in emerging markets. You look at the sovereign wealth funds, the new exchanges being set-up, and the capital markets growth in these markets, and you will see that creation of wealth very clearly. It’s very visible to a lot of people; the world’s investors, asset managers, brokers and dealers are all rapidly expanding into these markets.</p>
<p>In the US, 80 per cent of the funding of financing for corporates comes from the capital markets, but it’s quite the reverse in emerging markets. So, as the capital markets pick up, that will shift from bank financing to capital markets financing. And once that happens, then Citi’s infrastructures on the securities and fund services side will be there to service those capital flows.</p>
<h5 id="technology-has-a-big-impact-on-these-markets-as-well">Technology has a big impact on these markets as well.</h5>
<p>Yes, technological advancement is really driving innovation; it’s creating break-out industries and enabling business coordination globally. And also, I think this, combined with the ever-increasing focus on risk management and compliance, has increased the need for integrated and secure information flows to enable information access anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Centralised control is facilitated by the convergence of industry standards and connectivity, such as SWIFTNet and XML, and these are some of the things we are investing in. Also, as one of the leading banks investing in identity management, we are already working with some of the leading corporates to create a risk management environment where identity mechanisms ensure there is a secure commercial and financial transaction environment.</p>
<p>One of the examples I can give you is Merck, who has really used the latest technology and standards to establish universal cash processes across 73 countries worldwide. This was launched in July of 2007 with SWIFTNet SCORE and the first two phases of XML ISO 20022, and it continues to role out in 2008. Merck’s bank rationalisation project is already forecasting interest gains of about €2m, plus several million dollars’ worth of cost avoidance through a combination of IT maintenance savings, process efficiency and improved control of cash.</p>
<h5 id="would-you-say-that-technology-enables-companies-to-reach-around-the-world-and-exercise-control">Would you say that technology enables companies to reach around the world and exercise control?</h5>
<p>Absolutely. The world is really shrinking and becoming a global village. And then you’re also seeing a change in the consumer demographics. Consumers have a greater expectation on the side of convenience, mobility, control and immediacy for their transactions.</p>
<p>What we’ve done is that in order for us to facilitate those flows, the remittances flows, we have got a few strategic alliances. For instance, we have done an alliance with Euro Giro that will bring about 61 connections in 50 countries. We are also looking at mobile remittances.</p>
<h5 id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-a-cfo-or-a-treasurer-operating-in-this-difficult-environment">As we reach the end of this interview, what advice would you give to a CFO or a Treasurer operating in this difficult environment?</h5>
<p>The key, like I said earlier on, is for a CFO and Treasurer to engage in the most important things. One is visibility of its working capital or operating cycle. The real-time information on its positions and access to tools which allows them to make the right borrowing or investment decisions.</p>
<p>The second thing I would say is, they need to have a very strong focus on the risk management which is an integral part of their operating model.</p>
<p>In other words, you need to start laying the foundation of an operating model, which is technology-driven, which is integrated, which has the right information and analytics and (essentially and obviously) feeds into the risk management processes.</p>
<p>Now, if you were to lay that foundation with the right operating model, it would serve two purposes. It magnifies and multiplies your performance when the economic cycle is favourable and it helps you get through a lot more effectively when the economy turns. So, the advice is really that. And is true not only just for the corporate, but for most of the business enterprise.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Following the launch of SEPA in January, this month we talk to Robert Heisterborg about ING’s Payments and Cash Management business, and discuss the impact of SEPA on corporates and the banking industry.</p>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Robert Heisterborg</h4>
<h5 class="title">Global Head Payments and Cash Management</h5>
<img alt="ING Wholesale Banking" class="logo org" height="25" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/ing-wholesale-banking-2008-100x25.png" width="100"/>
<p>Robert Heisterborg has been involved in payments and cash management since 1989. His experience ranges from treasury, cash and liquidity management at large international corporates to the commercial and operational processes within ING. In addition, he is active in numerous (inter) national interbank committees. (Member of the EPC Plenary, Vice-chairman EBA Clearing Board and Eurogiro Board member).</p>
<p>He is currently responsible for the global ING Wholesale PCM business. His responsibilities include Product Sales, Product Development and Client Service. Mr Heisterborg is 47 years old.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-is-the-background-of-the-international-cash-management-business-at-ing">What is the background of the international cash management business at ING?</h5>
<p>We are focused on being a leading European player in payments and cash management.</p>
<p>We are active in 20 countries. We have a very strong position in what we call our home markets: the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland and Romania. ING was one of the first movers in Central and Eastern Europe in the 1990s, and we have good in-country capabilities there. With the takeover of BBL ten years ago, we got a well developed network in southwestern Europe – France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland. We have combined all these activities under one leadership in order to serve our clients better. Through Bank Mendes Gans, a 100% subsidiary of ING, we can also offer global cash management and treasury services.</p>
<h5 id="what-products-and-services-do-you-offer">What products and services do you offer?</h5>
<p>In a nutshell: advisory services, accounts, transaction processing, reporting, liquidity management, collections – the whole range of cash management and payment services. It’s a full service for our internationally operating clients. In some of the 20 countries we also have very good, well established in-country capabilities, so we can compete with the local banks.</p>
<h5 id="how-is-ings-cash-management-business-differentiated-from-other-banks-offerings">How is ING’s cash management business differentiated from other banks’ offerings?</h5>
<p>The way we differentiate ourselves is by having a clear focus on Europe and by being able to offer our services with a very limited number of partnerships. There are many banks which offer European or global services, but if you look at it in more detail they have a long list of partnerships, or banking clubs like IBOS. The main advantage of being in control, and operating all the services yourself, is that you can guarantee the service level. When there are a lot of dependencies on partners you are not in control as your clients would like you to be.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that we don’t partner with banks to fill in gaps in our offering, but it’s on a limited level. In Europe we cover the Nordics with SEB, and in some countries we have arrangements for domestic cheque processing and cash because we don’t have a branch network everywhere. The accounts, processing and reporting are all done within ING. It’s a very limited use of partnerships. There is nothing wrong with partnerships, but I think this is the way for sustainable quality, because there are less dependencies and less risk in running the system.</p>
<p>Another differentiator is that we are active in 20 countries, which means that we have a lot of local knowledge. SEPA will enable corporates to run their payments and transaction business from one account with one bank. This is the theoretical model.</p>
<p>In practice, depending on how corporates are organised, if you have sales and marketing operations you want to be close to your clients. ING can offer this type of proximity because we have local people in all those countries, unlike a lot of other banks who have centralised their customer support.</p>
<p>We are also big from a payments perspective in countries with a very efficient payments culture, such as the Netherlands and Belgium. We leverage and export our expertise in this area to other countries in Europe.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-ings-strategic-objectives-regarding-the-pcm-business">What are ING’s strategic objectives regarding the PCM business?</h5>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, we aim to be a European player with a strong network and local knowledge. In addition, SEPA is all about scale, STP and effectiveness, and that’s the second pillar of our strategy. Being one of the bigger euro clearers in Europe, together with our network and local presence, we are in a position to use this to help clients in the migration process.</p>
<p>ING as a group has a certain flexibility and an entrepreneurial mindset. A good example is ING Direct – ING built this franchise by being a bit different from other models. In the group we have a lot of life insurance and pensions greenfields (companies that are built from scratch in a developing market). We know how to build and grow the business, with a certain commitment towards long lasting enterprises.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-the-payments-market-going-to-look-like-in-the-future">What is the payments market going to look like in the future?</h5>
<p>There is a consolidation process going on, not only on a global, but also on a European scale. We see a lot of our banking clients struggling with huge investments and the deterioration of the cost/income ratio. This will lead to shifts in the whole market landscape. A lot of banks will still offer the solutions, but the processing and the end-to-end management of the whole process, including the liquidity, will be done by large banks, and we want to be one of them.</p>
<p>The corporate market is being driven by regulators and technology, which bring more insight and faster and more reliable information on the whole business environment. This is shaping our landscape and we are looking to survive in this market. Banks should be able to enrich the information for their clients in their business processes, in areas such as electronic bill presentment and e-invoicing. More and more of the traditional world is moving to the e-world.</p>
<p>One word of caution: there is a strong need for corporates to have more standardisation and straight through processing. I think that’s good; we are more than willing to work on that to deliver solutions, but the corporate world also needs to work on standardisation.</p>
<p>In the automotive industry there’s some standardisation, but that’s not used in the oil or in the leisure industry. So on top of all kinds of industry standardisation, there should be a more pan-European or a more global way of standardisation. Otherwise we will never get to the level of STP and flexibility that corporates want.</p>
<p>A second word of caution is that this means a lot of investment from banks and corporates, besides all the investment from the regulatory perspective. We need to attain a sustainable business model. If we invest millions improving the whole value chain and being compliant with all types of regulatory conditions, we should be able to make a living out of it. If we can’t make a living out of it, in the end I think the clients are worse off.</p>
<p>I don’t mind competition. Corporates always say they want to buy quality, which we offer, but they are buying on price. The problem is, we can’t give everything away for free or at very low prices. Given the high level of reliability and security our clients rightfully expect, this is not a sustainable business model. If you don’t allow the industry to stay healthy, there is a danger of underinvesting and this won’t lead to the solutions our clients want.</p>
<h5 id="how-does-sepa-fit-into-ings-strategy-for-payments-and-cash-management">How does SEPA fit into ING’s strategy for payments and cash management?</h5>
<p>SEPA is a reality – it won’t go away. However, it’s not finished yet. The industry has taken the first step and built the SEPA Credit Transfer – now it’s up to clients to use it. There’s still a lot of work to be done. I think it’s going to take much longer than politicians anticipate.</p>
<p>As to how SEPA fits into ING’s strategy, we are still investing a lot of time and money in dealing with SEPA. We see it as an opportunity to consolidate and improve our position as one of the leading European banks. We are already positioned as a pan-European player with activities in 20 countries and a huge amount of euro transactions, and we can leverage that towards SEPA.</p>
<p>SEPA also gives ING an opportunity to improve our processes. Europe is a scattered landscape with many types of local regulations and local market practices, and this allows us to benefit from our scale on a pan-European level.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-cope-with-the-increased-regulatory-pressure">How do you cope with the increased regulatory pressure (such as the Payment Services Directive (PSD))?</h5>
<p>It’s a fact we have to deal with, and we deal with it. In the end the PSD will serve the ambition of having a better market in Europe. It could lead to more competition. I think ING is well positioned to serve our clients in a more competitive market.</p>
<p>While I do think these regulatory initiatives are beneficial for the whole industry, I struggle with the timing occasionally. I think this applies to corporates as well as banks. New regulations would be much easier to implement if you could combine the investments with your natural investment cycles, in line with the technical, economical depreciation of your processes and systems. And that’s a challenge that corporates also have to manage. SEPA has an impact on them and people shouldn’t underestimate that. A bank like ING can really support our clients and advise them on how to deal with this.</p>
<h5 id="how-proactive-are-your-clients-being-in-terms-of-migrating-to-sepa">How proactive are your clients being in terms of migrating to SEPA?</h5>
<p>It differs. Some clients see it as an opportunity to address their own treasury and back office activities. It also differs by country. In some countries there is already a very efficient and low priced system and there’s less appetite to migrate. In other countries with a different pricing level and service level it could be more attractive to migrate.</p>
<p>So we see all flavours, both in the banking and corporate markets. We actively inform clients and we have ready-to-go solutions that clients can use now.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-your-opinion-of-the-pace-of-the-migration">SEPA was only launched in January. What is your opinion of the pace of the migration?</h5>
<p>Migration is going to take much longer than the regulators anticipated. This is a personal observation, but in the end I think we need a fixed end date, compulsory for everybody, to have a forced migration towards SEPA, ultimately supported by a law.</p>
<p>I can’t imagine the introduction of the euro based on self regulation – we still would have legacy coins now. I think if we really want to make SEPA a success for all the parties involved – corporates, politicians, banks, government institutions – we need an end date.</p>
<h5 id="if-you-had-to-choose-an-end-date-when-would-it-be">If you had to choose an end date, when would it be?</h5>
<p>I would ask my clients first. If I picked an end date that was too early, I would force my clients into unnatural investment cycles. I think the normal IT cycle in a corporate is five to seven years. Then technology evolves and you have to invest again to maintain it. So if we were to choose a cut-off date of 2015, 2017, we would all know when the legacy systems stopped and we would be able to invest in an economically sound way.</p>
<h5 id="what-should-corporates-be-doing-right-now">What should corporates be doing right now?</h5>
<p>They should understand. We have developed an interactive tool for our clients called the SEPA Scan. This consists of a series of questions. Based on the answers, we give clients customised advice on the impact of SEPA on a number of different business areas.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-see-the-future-for-sepa">How do you see the future for SEPA?</h5>
<p>The real future for SEPA is the online world. All the investment in SEPA Direct Debit is great, but we are still investing a lot of time and money in bringing a legacy system up to SEPA standards.</p>
<p>I’m a strong advocate of the idea that as an industry we come up with standards for bill presentment and internet payments. We have some good examples like Billington, which is a joint venture initiative in the Netherlands for Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment, and iDEAL, which is a Dutch internet payment methodology.</p>
<p>I think as an industry, in order to leapfrog and become a very effective market, which is the ambition of the EU, we should invest more time and money in developing these standards. There will still be a place for legacy products in the future, but I really believe we should focus on the strength of the internet, because that’s going to be the base for market practice in the future.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Everyone has heard of Standard Chartered but do you know how big the bank is or where exactly it operates? In this interview, Karen Fawcett tells Treasury Today how this big bank is becoming the leading transactional bank for companies and institutional clients for and in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Karen Fawcett</h4>
<h5 class="title">Senior Managing Director and Group Head of Transaction Banking</h5>
<img alt="Standard Chartered" class="logo org" height="34" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/standard-chartered-logo-2009-90x34.png" width="90"/>
<p>Karen Fawcett is Senior Managing Director and Group Head of Transaction Banking, part of Standard Chartered Bank’s Wholesale Banking business. Based in Singapore, Karen is responsible for the end-to-end performance of Transaction Banking comprising Cash Management, Trade Services, Securities Services and Electronic Channels.</p>
<p>Prior to this, Karen was the Global Head of Strategy for the Wholesale Bank, where she was responsible for the repositioning strategy of the Wholesale business and key acquisitions including Korea First Bank.</p>
<p>Karen joined the Bank in 2001 from Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton, where she was Vice President and Partner focussed on the financial services sector in Asia Pacific. Karen, who is British, holds an MBA from INSEAD and graduated from Cambridge with an MA (Economics).</p>
</div>
<h5 id="tell-me-a-bit-more-about-standard-chartered">Tell me a bit more about Standard Chartered.</h5>
<p>The Standard Chartered Group was formed in 1969 through a merger of two banks: The Standard Bank of British South Africa founded in 1863 and the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, founded by Royal Charter in 1853.</p>
<p>The bank has been in Asia, Africa and the Middle East for over 150 years. We launched our first branches in India and China in 1858 and are now the largest international bank in India (by number of branches) and the oldest international bank in China and the only one to operate continuously since opening. Today we’ve got an extensive network throughout these regions and can provide a unique mix of strong domestic and cross border services</p>
<h5 id="and-are-you-still-a-british-bank">And are you still a British bank?</h5>
<p>We are definitely a British bank. We are listed on the London Stock Exchange. We rank among the top 25 companies in the FTSE 100 by market capitalisation and are among the largest banks in the UK. We are regulated by the FSA in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Our lead regulator is the FSA in the United Kingdom. In addition, we are regulated by the local regulators in the countries where we operate.</p>
<h5 id="you-say-you-are-a-british-bank-thats-not-really-where-the-heart-is-beating-is-it">You say you are a British bank; that’s not really where the heart is beating, is it?</h5>
<p>Well, we’ve now got 65,000 people, over 100 nationalities in over 1,400 branches across more than 50 countries. We are a bank focused on providing the best services for and in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, through a unique mixture of on the ground presence in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, a corporate office in the UK and strong client and sales capabilities in the UK, US and increasingly across Europe to serve major corporates and institutions.</p>
<p>Our clients are a very balanced mixture of local corporates and institutions in our local markets and international corporates and institutions who may be based in OECD countries, but operating across Asia, Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<h5 id="youre-competing-with-a-lot-of-the-big-international-banks-that-may-have-a-bigger-presence-in-the-oecd">Now I guess that means that you’re competing with a lot of the big international banks that may have a bigger presence in the OECD and also have some presence in Asia or Africa or the Middle East?</h5>
<p>Yes. The competitors vary by client segment and when we are dealing with the global clients, we’re head to head with the big global banks. We have a network strength in our franchise markets which the global banks can’t match, and when we’re competing with the local banks, we have cross-border capabilities that they can’t match. So we’re sitting in the middle – being able to compete effectively both domestically and across borders.</p>
<h5 id="is-standard-chartered-exposed-to-any-of-that">A lot of the big international banks have been experiencing problems coming out of the US sub-prime market. Is Standard Chartered exposed to any of that?</h5>
<p>Standard Chartered has no direct exposure to US sub-prime, Alt A or second lien mortgages. Standard Chartered has a very small, indirect exposure to the sub-prime sector through one special investment vehicle (SIV) and we have been prudently managing and restructuring this portfolio of quality assets. Relative to other banks, we’ve had few concerns with this issue. Standard Chartered is very liquid and strongly capitalised.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-the-credit-markets-in-asia-doing">The credit markets in Europe are a little bit tight and a little bit nervous as a result of these problems. What are the credit markets in Asia doing?</h5>
<p>Well, so far, we are finding actually a huge amount of business coming to us. Some of our competitors have definitely been more affected in Europe and the US than we have and, therefore, that has enabled us to continue doing more business in this area. The impact on our clients so far seems to be very minimal. I think the concerns will be in the longer term if the US does go into a slow down.</p>
<h5 id="could-you-tell-us-a-bit-more-about-why-you-bought-that-and-what-it-does-to-your-business">You bought American Express Bank last year. Could you tell us a bit more about why you bought that and what it does to your business?</h5>
<p>American Express Bank provides us with two distinct businesses that fit exactly into what we are doing strategically. This acquisition gives us additional scale in our financial institutions business and it fast tracks the development of our private banking business.</p>
<p>On the financial institutions side, the acquisition gives us a significant number of new relationships and locations, a strong sales and service model and it doubles the size of our core dollar clearing business – we will become the number six clearer in the US. We will add a euro clearing capability in Frankfurt, which is obviously extremely important given the increasing importance of the euro, and will strengthen our yen clearing capability.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-the-other-two">Financial Institutions is one of your three target customer segments. What are the other two?</h5>
<p>The other ones are Local Corporates, and Global Corporates, which includes large Commodity Corporates.</p>
<h5 id="is-china-important-to-you">Is China important to you?</h5>
<p>We view China as an incredibly critical part of our business. The growth rates that we’re seeing there are very substantial and look as though they are going to continue. We see increasing demand from both international clients and are increasingly building very strong relationships with some of the larger, state owned and local companies within China.</p>
<p>We are locally incorporated and have a very active branch expansion strategy which will help drive growth in both the consumer and wholesale businesses there. We have a two pronged strategy in China; the Standard Chartered Bank subsidiary which was recently locally incorporated and a 19% stake in Bohai Bank, a new local bank based in Tianjin.</p>
<h5 id="can-you-tell-me-a-bit-more-about-what-you-do">Can you tell me a bit more about what you do?</h5>
<p>I’m Group Head of Transaction Banking, which is one of four main product areas within wholesale banking, the other areas being Financial Markets, Corporate Finance and Principal Finance. Transaction Banking represents around 50% of our client revenue, so it’s a substantial part of the wholesale banking business, encompassing cash management, trade finance, security services and what we call client access, which encompasses the electronic platforms and our network management function. Our ambition is to be number one in transaction banking for corporate and institutional clients, for and in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-your-main-products-and-services">What are your main products and services?</h5>
<p>We’ve really covered the banking space already and I think there are three others areas worth focusing on.</p>
<p>First is our whole approach to working capital services for corporate clients. The second would be our approach to electronic capabilities for transactions and value added services, and thirdly our capabilities in the security services space.</p>
<h5 id="what-does-working-capital-services-cover">What does working capital services cover?</h5>
<p>Working capital services for corporate clients is a broad subject and I think there are three key areas where we are particularly strong. Firstly, what we’re doing on the sales model. Secondly, the cash management capabilities and thirdly our new integrated capabilities across trade and supply chains services.</p>
<p>In December 2006 we re-vamped our entire sales force to better meet the needs of our clients because they wanted to have one person in front of them who could discuss their entire working capital process rather than having to work with two people to put an overall solution together. And, so far, that is working very well for our clients and proving to be a lot more fun and a better value proposition to attract good staff.</p>
<p>We’ve been a very strong provider of cash management for a long time and we have always had a philosophy of building global platforms. Our global platforms enable us to innovate and roll out capabilities quite quickly to meet the needs of local communities or different client segments. This year we are launching comprehensive multicurrency capabilities to meet the increasing needs of our clients.</p>
<h5 id="trade-finance-must-be-very-important-to-you">Trade finance must be very important to you.</h5>
<p>Yes, we’re now ranked first for trade transaction volumes in Hong Kong, Singapore and the UAE, which is the first time we’ve beaten HSBC in their core market, so we’re quite pleased about that. At the moment we’re the third largest trade bank in the world and we’re hoping to get to number two very quickly.</p>
<p>We also have a slightly different approach to supply chain management. We have cross-border supply chain capabilities in 24 markets and it’s an approach that is run globally, so if a client wants us to provide supply chain services for either their buyers or their suppliers across markets, we can do that on a co-ordinated fashion across all the countries. By the end of the year, we will be on the same platform with a global limit management system in place across all those markets.</p>
<h5 id="how-does-that-result-in-terms-of-benefits-to-the-customer">You’ve talked about your electronic platforms, but how does that result in terms of benefits to the customer?</h5>
<p>Well, most of our clients are across multiple countries. So the first thing is being able to give them exactly the same services in each country which we have achieved through our Straight2Bank platform launched in all our markets last year.</p>
<p>The second advantage is that by standardising the platforms and our operational processes, turnaround times and the overall quality of processing is significantly better. We’re also moving to a 24/7 processing approach with our hubs in Chennai and Kuala Lumpur working 24 hours a day. If a client gives us documents in the evening, it’s back on their desk the next morning. So that gives them significantly higher service levels. And we’re able to do that because we have the same platforms everywhere.</p>
<h5 id="where-are-you-seeing-the-most-growth">Where are you seeing the most growth?</h5>
<p>Well, when I look at the growth in our trade, the fastest growth is between our markets and that is driven by both underlying demand of those populations and also we’re seeing an increasing trend of goods being moved between countries for different stages in manufacturing. So, something may start off in Vietnam, or start in China, go to Indonesia and then be shipped to the US.</p>
<p>For Africa we are seeing huge commodity flows – frequently driven by the very high demand from China. There is also demand from Africa for finished products coming from Asia. So Africa is becoming an increasingly important market for us. And with our unique and strong footprint across these two continents, we are really well placed to serve our clients along this Asia-Africa trade corridor.</p>
<h5 id="is-there-anything-that-you-see-that-corporates-tend-to-miss-or-developments-in-the-markets-youre-operating-in-that-corporates-may-not-be-aware-of">Is there anything that you see that corporates tend to miss or developments in the markets you’re operating in that corporates may not be aware of?</h5>
<p>For many of our clients, the key issue is making sure that they understand the health of their buyers. For example, if their buyers are in the UK and Europe or more so in the US, corporates need to think about whether these buyers have the liquidity and have stable operations. They also need to assess if the level of demand is going to remain the same</p>
<p>With a possible recession or economic slowdown looming, we are helping our clients make sure that they are managing their liquidity very tightly because we expect that as these US sub-prime issues continue to go through the banking sector, there is going to be a tightening of credit. That means really looking at banking relationships to make sure that the banks that clients are using are in the best of health and will continue to put a big focus on these regions. We saw the tightening of credit towards the end of the year in the trade space. However, we still saw a lot of business come our way. This year, we also expect that to continue.</p>
<p>For those clients coming into Asia, well, it’s sort of the reverse of the story. Corporates need to be sure of who they are dealing with and that target companies have a stable base of regional demand and are not relying solely on buyers in the West, contending with this more challenging credit landscape.</p>
<h5>Thank you.</h5></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>In this interview, Wen Jin Xiang, general manager of corporate banking at China Citic Bank talks to us about China’s nascent cash management business.</p>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Wen Jin Xiang</h4>
<h5 class="title">General manager of the corporate banking department</h5>
<img alt="China Citic Bank" class="logo org" height="26" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/china-citic-bank-logo-2008-110x26.png" width="110"/>
<p>Wen Jin Xiang graduated from the University of Shanghai Finance and Economics with a Masters degree. He was appointed as the deputy president of Suzhou branch and Dalian branch of China Citic Bank, and he is currently the general manager of the corporate banking department of China Citic Bank.</p>
<p>With 15 years of work experience in the commercial bank industry, he has a very good knowledge of bank management and has experience of working in many bank departments including corporate banking, retail banking, international business, treasury and capital market, financial planning and risk control, etc.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="can-you-give-us-a-brief-introduction-to-china-citic-bank">Can you give us a brief introduction to China CITIC Bank?</h5>
<p>China CITIC Bank is the first emerging national commercial bank established since China’s reform and opening up policy and is also the first bank to launch a dual-listing on the Shanghai and Hong Kong Stock Exchanges. Since its establishment in 1987, CITIC Bank, leveraging the comprehensive financial service platform of CITIC Group, has achieved excellent business performance through growth by striking the right balance between profitability, quality and scale and by pursuing risk-free profits, steadily-growing market value and constant expansion and innovation.</p>
<p>Up to the end of 2006, CITIC Bank has ranked 7<sup>th</sup> in China’s domestic commercial banking industry in terms of total banking assets, and topped the list in domestic small and mediumsized joint-stock commercial banks with corporate deposits. According to the 2006 ranking of the British magazine ‘The Banker’, CITIC Bank comes 160<sup>th</sup> out of the world’s largest 1000 banks for tier one capital, and ranks 127<sup>th</sup> in terms of total assets.</p>
<p>Since the founding of the CITIC bank, corporate banking business has always been one of our core businesses. Its competitive edge and service features have helped CITIC bank maintain its leadership among small and medium-sized domestic commercial banks in such aspects as corporate financing, international business, and funds and capital market business. In recent years, thanks to the continuous focus on financial product innovation, our corporate banking business has launched a great number of products and services with CITIC features, contributing to our healthy social image and wide acknowledgement from our clients.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-understand-the-cash-management-business">How do you understand the cash management business?</h5>
<p>In recent years, the cash management business has gained broad recognition in China. On the one hand, corporations are facing an increased need to use cash management to lower financial cost, quicken cash turnover and gain cash income. On the other hand, cash management can bring considerable fee-based income to the banking sector, and help the bank and the corporate forge a closer relationship. Therefore, cash management becomes one of the focuses in the future competition between foreign and domestic commercial banks, driven by the need of the corporations to improve their management and that of the bank to grow its business.</p>
<p>Though different banks have various interpretations for cash management, there is a common understanding that cash management is a customised comprehensive solution combining a series of traditional financial products including settlement, investment and financing and account management, the main aims of which have been to help the clients maximise their cash operation efficiency and minimise financial exposure while at the same time maintaining the necessary cash flow required by day-to-day operation.</p>
<p>In our view, cash management in its broad sense, should include products and services such as collection and payment management, account management, liquidity management, investment and financing management and risk management, while in its narrow sense, cash management mainly involves account management, collection and payment management and liquidity management.</p>
<p>We think that all corporate clients will need cash management products. Among them, general clients primarily need account management and collection and payment management, while group clients require more services in multi-account cash pooling, centralized cash control and value-added cash investment services.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-the-characteristics-of-your-cash-management-business">What are the characteristics of your cash management business?</h5>
<p>We have always considered cash management as an important financial service. The characteristics of CITIC cash management business are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>A perfect organizational architecture.</h5>
<p>We have set up a separate department at our head office, responsible for rule-making, brand-building, product design and infrastructure development for the corporate cash management business of the whole bank. This department is also charged with the responsibility of helping our branches target key accounts with our marketing efforts and designing tailor-made solutions for them. Dedicated product managers in each branch are in charge of the marketing and promotion of cash management businesses in their territory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>A consistent brand.</h5>
<p>CITIC Cash Management service brand is well-established in the market, so our uniform brand image and service standard based on brand management norms has been accepted by the market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Strong product functions.</h5>
<p>Our cash management solution includes collection and payment management, account management, liquidity management, investment and financing management and risk management, providing all-round product support based on customer demands. Especially in the area of group client cash management, CITIC bank can develop different forms of cash centralisation solutions in response to different customer needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Advanced system support.</h5>
<p>Cash management can not be implemented without the support of an advanced information system. Our efficient payment settlement network provides real-time intra-system payment transfer through online banking. The inter bank transfer system, which has established seamless links with the payment system of the People’s Bank of China, is enabling quick funds transfer. At the same time, our back office system supports the setting-up of a range of cash pools, satisfying various needs of group customers in terms of the sweeping and assignment of funds, quota allocation and overdraft.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Rich service experiences.</h5>
<p>Through designing cash management solutions for hundreds of large corporations and group customers, CITIC bank has accumulated abundant practical experiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Professional service teams.</h5>
<p>Based on the comprehensive financial service platform of CITIC group and equipped with talents from all areas of the financial world, CITIC Bank is able to offer clients professional services and comprehensive financial solutions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="what-benefits-can-customers-gain-from-the-bank-cash-management-business">What benefits can customers gain from the bank cash management business?</h5>
<p>We have designed several forms of cash management solutions for a number of large group customers. Generally speaking, before implementing cash management solutions, subsidiaries of the same group tend to open accounts at several different banks. At one point in time, some of the subsidiaries may have cash surplus in their accounts, which they deposit in the bank only to gain relatively low interest income, while others may suffer from a shortage of cash and have to get loans from the bank. The inability of the group headquarters to collect information in relation to the subsidiaries’ cash position in time and co-ordinate cash surplus and shortage in a centralized fashion results in inefficient utilization of internal funds and high financial cost.</p>
<p>We have designed tailored intra-group cash pools which enable physical or notional sweeping of funds. Through flexible sweeping, assignment and internal quota management, they provide centralised management and deployment of intragroup funds. With a nationwide network and an efficient online banking system, we help group customers transfer the funds from their subsidiaries to an account designated by the group headquarters in real-time or at certain intervals, thus enabling the quick centralisation of the group’s originally dispersed funds. In this way, we have helped the customers turn ‘3 highs’ into ‘3 lows’ – from high deposits, high loans and high cost to low deposits, low loans and low cost – because now the headquarters have better control over the cash position of all subsidiaries and make better decisions about the allocation within the group.</p>
<p>We believe that in choosing our cash management solutions, the customer will benefit from higher cash liquidity, efficiency and return, and lower financial cost as a result of better internal information sharing and cash allocation.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>With a market capitalisation of over €90 billion, Santander is one of the world’s top 10 financial groups by market value. Santander operates in continental Europe, the UK (under Abbey) and Latin America and has 69 million customers worldwide. This month we speak to Federico Papa about developments in global trade and Santander’s supply chain solutions.</p>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Federico Papa</h4>
<h5 class="title">Managing Director and Global Head Trade, Export and Commodity Finance Global Transaction Banking</h5>
<img alt="Santander" class="logo org" height="35" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/santander-logo-2008-120x35.png" width="120"/>
<p>Federico Papa is Managing Director and Global Head Trade, Export &amp; Commodity Finance at Banco Santander. He reports to Carlos Rodriguez de Robles, Managing Director and Head of Global Transaction Banking within Global Banking &amp; Markets.</p>
<p>Prior to his current responsibilities, Federico was EMEA Head Cross Border Structured &amp; Commodity Finance at ABN AMRO Bank in London and before that Latin America Head for the same line of business in Sao Paulo, Brazil. In 15 years of international banking and structured finance experience, he has held several positions in the US, Europe and Latin America.</p>
<p>Federico graduated as an Economist from the Universidad de la Republica in Montevideo, Uruguay and holds an MBA from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. He currently lives in Madrid with his wife and two children.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="where-is-global-transaction-banking-positioned-in-santander-group">Where is Global Transaction Banking positioned in Santander Group?</h5>
<p>Global Transaction Banking is situated within Global Banking and Markets, the wholesale banking arm of Santander Group.</p>
<p>Global Transaction Banking has a global remit to deliver transaction banking services to Santander Group’s large corporate and international financial institutions. Global Transaction Banking covers the following product areas which work together closely to deliver seamless customer solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cash Management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trade, Export &amp; Commodity Finance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working Capital Finance</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As the international bank with the largest number of offices in the world, it is entirely logical that international cash management and trade should be key elements of our customer proposition. We have brought our structured trade finance solutions under the same roof as Cash Management and Trade Services, in order to ensure a one stop shop for our customers who trade internationally. Our Trade, Export &amp; Commodity Finance team delivers specialist solutions, covering a range of asset classes, such as Export Credit Agency backed facilities, as well as structured trade and commodity finance solutions, in addition to classic documentary trade services. In this way, Santander is expanding as a global player with its foundations firmly in its core markets (Europe and Latin America) and supporting its clients in Asia, Middle East and other emerging markets.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-santanders-value-proposition-and-how-do-you-differentiate-yourselves">What is Santander’s value proposition and how do you differentiate yourselves?</h5>
<p>We take a holistic approach to delivering solutions to customers’ cash and trade needs. We are creating solution-oriented teams combining the skills of our product specialists and sales teams with an understanding of our customers’ industries. We are mindful that the world of transaction banking is undergoing important changes, driven by the need for lower processing costs and efficient working capital solutions. Cash and trade are converging and our customers increasingly seek a total package; for example, covering regional liquidity management, international supply chain finance and local banking services across a range of countries, including T&amp;E card solutions.</p>
<p>In this way, we can act as a gateway to banking in the geographies where we are strongly represented, in particular Latin America, Spain and Portugal, while helping our customers to trade efficiently with other regions. Within Global Transaction Banking one of our key roles is therefore to co-ordinate our solution delivery across a number of Santander units internationally, to ensure the best possible solution for our customers and provide them with a single point of contact for transaction banking needs. ﻿</p>
<p>We believe the key difference in our value proposition is that we can deliver local expertise in a range of important emerging markets, along with global reach in relationship management. Similarly, in trade we are strengthening our structuring capabilities in Export Finance, typically supported by Export Credit Agencies (ECAs) as part of non-recourse deals and project finance. This is enhanced by our ability to underwrite large deals in our core markets to finance acquisitions and large capital expenditure programmes, based on underlying export flows.</p>
<h5 id="what-trends-do-you-see-in-global-trade">What trends do you see in global trade?</h5>
<p>We are redefining our value proposition in the light of important market trends in world trade, driven by the globalisation of procurement and ‘lowest cost country sourcing’. Cross-border trade is growing fast, having quadrupled in the last 20 years. On the other hand, overall documentary trade volumes, letters of credit (L/Cs) and documentary collections, have remained flat over the last six to seven years. This stability in documentary trade volumes masks some interesting details:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In emerging markets documentary trade is actually going up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Middle market usage of L/Cs is also rising.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The average value of L/Cs is rising.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the top end of the market, some large corporates are trying to move away from L/Cs, given their perceived costly and paper intensive nature.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, documentary trade remains very important, indeed an essential part of cross-border trade, in many of the markets where we operate – in particular emerging markets and regulated countries where exchange controls are in force. Therefore, we recognise the importance of an efficient documentary trade service at Santander. Similarly, in other more advanced economies and indeed at the beginning of new trade relationships, especially between distant counterparties, L/Cs provide added comfort for both the importer and exporter. ﻿</p>
<p>For these reasons we consider that documentary trade will continue to be important to many of our customers for a long time to come. It is the way of delivering these documentary trade services which is evolving and this is where we need to ensure the smart use of web-based technologies to streamline processes, minimise timescales and cut costs. It is also noteworthy that the potential downturn in the credit and commodity cycle could create valuable opportunities for structured deals in our Trade Export &amp; Commodity Finance group.</p>
<h5 id="how-are-you-using-technology-to-support-your-customers">How are you using technology to support your customers?</h5>
<p>Celent estimates that 8% of the value of total global trade is spent on processing and finance related costs. This explains why corporates are so keen to find ways to cut costs by reducing the volume of paper involved in their trade transaction processing. We see this as a step by step migration away from burdensome manual processing of paper towards more efficient straight through processing of data.</p>
<p>This evolution from paper to electronic processing is relevant both in cash management and trade, although to date cash products have in general had greater success in cutting costs and migrating to electronic delivering, with higher levels of straight through processing (STP) .</p>
<p>Santander has a good reputation for its use of technology in driving improved efficiency, as reflected in our strong cost/income ratios. In Global Transaction Banking Cash and Trade we are placing great emphasis on the efficient use of technology to enable improved solutions and customer satisfaction. For example, we are developing Regional Liquidity Management and Payment Hub solutions which enable streamlined cash management and lowest cost routing of payments and collections into local clearing systems. ﻿</p>
<p>This includes our SEPA solutions, with pan-European reach. We are also rolling out electronic delivery of trade solutions, so that it is easier and more cost effective for corporates to manage import and export L/Cs, as well as standby L/Cs. In Mexico, for example, the use of web delivery for L/C issuance and discrepancy management has helped grow our market share significantly.</p>
<h5 id="do-you-see-any-other-changes-in-global-trade">Do you see any other changes in global trade?</h5>
<p>Exciting new trade flows are emerging. Of particular interest to many customers of Santander Group are the export flows to Asia for Latin American commodity producers. China is the world’s largest consumer of copper, zinc, iron ore and steel. Santander is already the largest financial institution in Latin America and we are now focusing on extending our presence in Asia, with the creation of branches and representative offices in key centres such as Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong. Our Trade, Export and Commodity Finance Team already has a presence in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>We are also launching new web-based products which allow our Western importers to view and approve trade documents, hence enabling Asian exporters to get paid quicker under discounting facilities.</p>
<h5 id="to-what-extent-are-your-customers-focusing-on-streamlining-the-financial-supply-chain">To what extent are your customers focusing on streamlining the financial supply chain?</h5>
<p>We see an important trend in the consolidation of the physical and financial supply chains. Our customers are increasingly driven by working capital management metrics such as minimising Day Sales Outstanding and Days Inventory Outstanding, while extending Days Payables Outstanding. We are particularly well placed to help our customers here, since Santander already has nearly 20 years’ experience of a supply chain finance solution known as Confirming, already used by over 250,000 buyers and suppliers.</p>
<p>Essentially, this solution is a form of reverse factoring which enables suppliers to obtain early settlement of invoices without recourse, while buyers are able to extend payment terms or negotiate a reduction in cost of goods. We are a market-leader in Spain, Portugal and Latin America and we are currently extending the range of geographies where Global Confirming is available, hence ensuring efficient working capital management for our clients and their suppliers internationally.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-see-supply-chain-solutions-evolving">How do you see supply chain solutions evolving?</h5>
<p>There is undoubtedly a continuing movement towards electronic delivery of trade and cash services. Here we have a strong competitive advantage, thanks to our deep expertise in various forms of Confirming where we have already achieved significant volumes and country coverage. We therefore see an opportunity to deepen our involvement in the supply chain through e-invoicing solutions. ﻿</p>
<h5 id="what-do-you-think-of-swifts-latest-initiatives-in-cash-and-trade">What do you think of SWIFT’s latest initiatives in cash and trade?</h5>
<p>SWIFT is a highly valued partner for Santander Group. We are actively involved in SWIFT’s initiatives such as Corporate Access, using MA-CUGs or SCORE, given the benefits for our customers by way of standardised, secure and resilient bank connectivity, enabling improved STP. This has proved an attractive proposition for a growing number of our large corporates. We even have large customers sending us files of confirmed invoices via FileAct which we then discount to suppliers, under our Global Confirming solution. This is a good example of how we are joining up cash and working capital finance solutions for our customers.</p>
<p>Given our focus on trade, we are also participating in SWIFT’s global trade initiative Trade Services Utility (TSU). We would expect to see this gain momentum and we are looking forward to Release II of this product. In 2008 we will see the launch of Bank Payment Obligations, whereby a bank can provide an undertaking to another bank that it will make a future dated payment, provided documents presented through the TSU are matched. This will enable a highly streamlined form of supply chain finance, where corporates effectively outsource the automated matching of trade documents, such as purchase orders, commercial invoices, shipping documents and insurance certificates. This initiative will enable individual banks to meet the needs of both ends of a supply chain (ie buyer and supplier), with significant efficiency gains and bottom line benefits for all parties.</p>
<p>On the other hand, TSU will also enable banks to work closely with partner banks to improve the working capital of their customers.</p>
<h5 id="any-concluding-comments">Any concluding comments?</h5>
<p>With all these changes and exciting challenges, transaction banking is certainly the place to be! By bringing together our transactional and structuring capabilities in Trade, Export and Commodity Finance, Santander is positioned to serve our clients globally.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>In this interview, Ruud Nijs, Head of Financial Logistics, Rabobank, digs deep into the area of supply chain management, identifying the three layers to the supply chain – physical, information and financial. He looks at new technology including portals, mobile payments, XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) and RFID, as well as the role SWIFT Trade Services Utility (TSU) can play in making the supply chain more efficient.</p>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Ruud Nijs</h4>
<h5 class="title">Head of Financial Logistics</h5>
<img alt="Rabobank" class="logo org" height="61" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/rabobank-logo-2007-50x61.png" width="50"/>
<p>Ruud Nijs is the Head of Financial Logistics at Rabobank and has been working for Rabobank since 2002. He began his career at ABN AMRO where he worked for over 12 years in several different roles including Senior Relationship Manager, Senior Vice President of Global Transactions Services (GTS) and Regional Manager in EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) for GTS. He subsequently worked as MD EMEA for a US software company and headed his own (Artificial Intelligence) start-up company before moving to Rabobank.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="why-are-you-applying-this-to-supply-chain-management">Let’s start off with the phrase ‘old wine in new bottles’ – why are you applying this to supply chain management?</h5>
<p>Everybody is talking about the supply chain – you can’t go to a seminar without hearing about it. But this is a very old topic that we’ve been hearing about for twenty years and probably 80-90% of this area is recycled topics. I’m tempted to say to my colleagues at the other banks, wake up – don’t use this as a commercial tool to get more companies into your banking arena, but really dig into the area and see how you can help to make processes for industries more efficient.</p>
<p>What is of interest here are the innovations that we can link into this topic. Under the heading of supply chain management we are now focusing on innovations in areas such as portal technology and international standards, for example. I believe this should be done on a multi-bank level.</p>
<h5 id="so-what-is-actually-new-about-this-topic">So what is actually new about this topic?</h5>
<p>Supply chain as a whole has three layers. There is the physical supply chain – the actual movement of goods. Then there is the information supply chain – the movement of data. And there is the financial supply chain – the movement of money. The trick is to combine these three layers – which stimulates new product development to optimise the processes aligned by SCM. For example, you can do reversed factoring, where you actually finance the customers’ suppliers. There are a lot of things which can be done to manage the supply chain from beginning to end:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First of all technology has been developing, so now for example there is portal technology where you as a user group can use your own white labelling on portals. That’s where you create a financial platform for the supply chain for a specific industry, rather than for the bank.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Portal technology is increasingly being created for PDAs. This can play a big part in areas such as transport and distribution (eg speeding up the time for releasing goods).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Portals are now completely multi-bank, so it’s not a question of one bank dominating this kind of change or only using it to bring customers into their account structures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another area is formats such as XBRL (Extensible Business Reporting Language). Companies can exchange data without printing it out, putting it in an envelope and sending it by post, only for someone else to type it in again. This speeds up the business between suppliers and buyers and reduces the risk involved. The electronic exchange of data between companies and banks is much more possible than ever before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Swift TSU (Trade Services Utility). The implementation of Swift TSU can really help to decrease costs in the financial supply chain and can speed up processes in the physical supply chain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New portal technology enables us to integrate Cash Management, Trade and Treasury far better into one complete proposition and sync that with the physical layer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="will-sepa-influence-the-supply-chain">Will SEPA influence the supply chain?</h5>
<p>SEPA is an important factor here. The credit transfer is more or less a done deal, the card schemes are done as well, and the pan-European direct debit is still under development. We foresee a fourth stream in SEPA, and that’s e-invoicing/m-payments (mobile payments). The idea is that at least in Europe and hopefully worldwide we will have a full standard of exchanging invoices between countries which will immediately drive supply chain management forward as well.</p>
<p>As a result of all this the role of banks within the supply chain will change. The bank used to come and say, do you want an account? Do you want a credit facility? Trade services? Now the banks are asking customers, what is your export policy? What are the payment terms between you and suppliers and customers and how can we help with that? What prevents you from making your (financial) targets? If you ask these questions you open up an abundance of new possibilities of innovation between banks and corporates, particularly in the financing area.</p>
<p>Another thing is the reduction of working capital by the reduction of days payable outstanding and the reduction of outstanding days of storage. The automation of processes can also reduce the risk of fraud. Insurance is another angle. If you can understand the risk in your supply chain you can mitigate it. You can do this using treasury and banking instruments but you can mitigate with insurance as well. Companies tend to start off by managing the credit risk of their suppliers, which is their number one problem. At the EuroFinance conference in Vienna I saw that most of the big companies were very interested in this approach. At SIBOS we learned that companies don’t want banks to sell products but to assist them in optimising the end-to-end process.</p>
<p>Ultimately I see the role of the bank changing – the bank is no longer coming in and selling; it is stepping into the supply chain as a partner.</p>
<h5 id="what-can-supply-chain-management-do-for-these-sectors-in-particular">Rabobank is traditionally very strong in the food and agricultural sectors – what can supply chain management do for these sectors in particular?</h5>
<p>We believe that supply chain management will play a big part in these sectors. Sustainability is a key issue here. You can take the example of an orange that is hanging on a tree in Brazil and destined for a supermarket shelf in France. If you can actually manage that supply chain and know exactly where that orange has been and what has happened to it you can certify the supply chain by giving it a green certificate confirming for example where it has come from and what chemicals have been used. That’s a new angle for us – it’s extremely important because sustainability and corporate responsibility is high on the agenda for most of the banks.</p>
<p>Physical goods have an international focus – they have to travel from country to country. It is a perfect industry in which to start piloting new approaches. I see supply chain management more as a way of thinking that aligns business processes, rather than a new product and therefore there will never be a big bang launch. We believe that the way forward with supply chain management is to make this area less vague by piloting new approaches and building open standards.</p>
<h5 id="from-the-point-of-view-of-the-corporate-treasurer-are-there-genuine-benefits-here">From the point of view of the corporate treasurer are there genuine benefits here?</h5>
<p>Absolutely. There are new developments, for example RFID (radio frequency identification) technology, which enables wireless payments to be made by mobile phones. There are mobile phones with RFID at this moment. The key is to use the technology and work together in these pilots with companies such as transporters and distributors to come up with ideas about using it better. But this should be done based on open standards and not in a closed, proprietary manner. That’s the important message there.</p>
<h5 id="mobile-payments-do-you-think-this-is-going-to-become-mainstream">Mobile payments is a topic we have been hearing a lot about recently. Do you think this is going to become mainstream?</h5>
<p>I do believe that it will become mainstream but it will take a couple of years. I always joke that we didn’t notice the mainframe turning into a desktop because mainframes became smaller and smaller. I believe that a large part of the market now doesn’t see that laptops are turning into PDAs. If you only focus on desktop and laptop solution technology you will absolutely miss the boat. If you have a PDA in your hand and can see on a real time basis whether or not a particular company has paid its bills you can immediately improve the sales productivity. So there is a sales productivity angle, as well as a financing angle and a working capital reduction angle. For companies this will bring a lot of advantages.</p>
<h5 id="do-you-think-the-security-implications-will-hinder-take-up-of-this-type-of-product">Do you think the security implications will hinder take up of this type of product?</h5>
<p>There is always a security implication. If you approve a payment instruction on a piece of paper, you put it in an envelope and you put it in a mail box, it can be tampered with. You can never guarantee 100% security. I believe that the security standards at this moment are so high that people are more willing to accept the residual risk.</p>
<p>In practical terms, we currently offer online banking via PDA for information purposes only. On a technical level we can easily link payment instructions to it as well but of course we want to be sure before we roll this out further.</p>
<p>This type of technology can actually enhance security as permissions can be tailored to individual users. People will be allowed to see and do only those things they are allowed to see and do. So a sales person for example might only be able to see the account of company X, whereas a corporate treasurer is authorised to access information at a more detailed level.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-rabobank-doing-in-the-supply-chain-area">What is Rabobank doing in the supply chain area?</h5>
<p>The Financial Logistics offering can be divided into two areas. First of all, we have liquidity management: cash flow management and payments and receivables. Automation and commoditisation are the key words there. By implementing those we are helping the whole philosophy of supply chain management to take a step forward. If corporates grant us insight into their purchase orders and the invoice data, the bank can combine liquidity with cash flow forecasting and with that reduce the need for working capital. In addition the bank can provide all kinds of finance (eg factoring) instruments.</p>
<p>The second area focuses on consultancy and risk management. We are training our people in this arena, we have our FL consultants in place who are able to sit down at the board table and ask the right questions and act as a consultant. Our products are tailored for working within this philosophy. I like to call this next level banking.</p>
<p>We are now involved in some tangible pilots:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We are creating a food and agri marketplace (‘Agroportal’). Companies working in food and agri can have access to this environment, and use it to exchange ideas and track their own goods. It’s like a closed user group for specialised food and agri companies – not necessarily just Rabobank clients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, we are working on a second pilot for companies who are (for example) getting oranges out of South America. Companies in Europe really want to know where the oranges have come from, whether forced labour was involved, what kind of chemicals were used, how long it has taken to get the oranges off the tree and into the shop. We are working with a couple of companies to see if we could deliver that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A third one relates to credit risk. By providing supplier finance to our customers’ suppliers, we can finance goods by looking at the deal rather than the customer itself. So we are working to see if we can use this to help customers to increase their business and mitigate their risks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="what-topics-will-we-be-talking-about-next-year">What topics will we be talking about next year?</h5>
<p>In 2008 SEPA is starting to become a reality. Up to now, it was the banks that needed to do all the work but next year companies will be able to benefit from it, provided that they themselves are ready for it as well. Corporates will need to understand the advantages of having SEPA. One of these has to be European cash management. I believe that the creation of payment factories will increase and that companies will focus on payments rather than receivables. On the payables side it really makes sense to try to concentrate on one set of accounts. On the receivables side it is much better to leave the banking structure as it is country by country in most of the cases. In 2008 you will not benefit from changing that set-up.</p>
<p>Again, supply chain will be on the agenda but hopefully in a much more tangible form than it is now. I hope that we will see a lot of pilots coming up and companies working together, making use of new technology.</p>
<p>On the treasury side, in 2008 we would hope that the existing liquidity crisis will be short-term. The whole credit industry however will see the impact of this in 2008 as well, as solvency with banks will be getting more scarce. In light of that, what we expect is that for companies with excess cash, the industry will come up with new products especially for that excess cash. At this moment most of the excess cash is simply put on the account of deposits – in the future there will be more and more treasury instruments to manage your excess cash, such as money market funds. So that’s a more general forecast for 2008.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>In this interview Robin and Yera share their views on the key issues and drivers in liquidity management, why and how HSBC has responded to their clients’ needs and the future for liquidity solutions.</p>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Robin Terry</h4>
<h5 class="title">Deputy Head, Corporate Sales – Europe</h5>
<img alt="HSBC" class="logo org" height="29" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/hsbc-the-worlds-local-bank-2010-90x29.png" width="90"/>
<p>Robin Terry is Deputy Head of Corporate Sales and Sector Sales Head for Consumer Brands and the Retail industry in Europe. He is responsible for overseeing relationships with the Bank’s largest customers and has considerable experience in the area of Shared Services Centres and liquidity structures. Before this role, Robin managed HSBC’s Continental European Sales team for five years.</p>
<p>Prior to returning to Europe in 1999, Robin was Senior Vice President and Regional Manager for HSBC’s global cash management operation in New York.</p>
</div>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Yera Hagopian</h4>
<h5 class="title">Senior Product Manager, Liquidity Services</h5>
<img alt="HSBC" class="logo org" height="29" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/hsbc-the-worlds-local-bank-2010-90x29.png" width="90"/>
<p>Yera Hagopian read French and Italian at Brasenose College, Oxford before joining Barclays Bank’s Management Development Program. She worked in Treasury and Relationship Management, including two years in the United States, prior to positions as European Sales Manager in Payments and Cash Management and International Product Director in Global Electronic Banking. In 1999 she joined HSBC as Global Product Manager for Liquidity Services.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-are-the-major-issues-for-your-clients-with-regard-to-liquidity-management-right-now">Robin, what are the major issues for your clients with regard to liquidity management right now?</h5>
<p>We are seeing an increasing need to establish cross-border, cross-currency liquidity structures as a result of four primary drivers:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Requirement to increase visibility of cash balances on a global basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability to access trapped cash and optimise use of that cash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Treasurer’s desire to reduce bank interest rate spreads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More and more trade flows being conducted in emerging market currencies, leading to more complex liquidity management.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Group Treasurer sits at the heart of the organisation. They have a wonderful perspective on the company’s financial pulse but they don’t run the company. By the nature of their role they are the go-betweens, marriage brokers and peace negotiators. They are very often the ‘glue’ within the enterprise and the challenge in any sizeable organisation is to break down stovepipes. This is just as true in liquidity as it is in other business areas. These stovepipes to which I alluded may be organisational – for example, one entity doesn’t communicate with another. They may be geographic – for example each country is responsible for its own business unit and not accountable to anyone other than at the highest level of the organisation so that liquidity is centralised but only within certain countries or regions. Or they may be currency – for example all liquidity is being managed via single currency pools but there is no management of the overall portfolio globally.</p>
<h5 id="which-would-you-say-is-the-single-most-important-liquidity-management-need-today-and-over-the-next-two-to-three-years">OK Robin, but if you had to prioritise, which would you say is the single most important liquidity management need today and over the next two to three years?</h5>
<p>Finding solutions that take into account the whole business and that basically run themselves. Too many liquidity solutions leave all the hard work, and the responsibility for accuracy, to the client. Inaccurate and clunky liquidity management means bigger margins for the banks. Customers need solutions that are not disastrous if they get their forecasts wrong one day.</p>
<p>Even the solutions that exist today are generally good for one country or one region but fail to encompass the whole position for the client. Some pooling here and sweeping there but very little everywhere else.</p>
<p>If an all-inclusive solution can be delivered today, as companies grow, then the future looks bright enabling new jurisdictions and/or currencies to be added.</p>
<h5 id="when-do-you-expect-to-have-a-solution-ready-that-really-satisfies-these-requirements">Yera, why exactly has HSBC addressed these issues and when do you expect to have a solution ready that really satisfies these requirements?</h5>
<p>Quite simply, without a robust liquidity management solution we jeopardise our chances of winning domestic, regional and indeed global mandates comprising the core transaction services, accounts, payables and receivables mandates which make up a large proportion of our revenues. We have, therefore, completely re-engineered our liquidity management capabilities. We are linking all our back office systems to a single global liquidity engine capable of taking a single view across the customer’s entire enterprise. This provides the optimal solution possible given country, currency and legal entity ‘mix’. We believe this is a far more flexible and holistic solution than we have seen in the marketplace to date.</p>
<p>This is a major investment for HSBC, the project is well underway and deployment will start to roll-out in the first tranche of countries later this year.</p>
<p>HSBC will be showcasing the new solution at this year’s International Cash and Treasury Management Conference in Vienna from 18<sup>th</sup>-20<sup>th</sup> September. Please call by the HSBC exhibition stand, if you are attending, to find out more.</p>
<h5 id="why-do-you-think-hsbc-is-in-a-strong-position-to-respond-to-the-above-needs">So Yera, why do you think HSBC is in a strong position to respond to the above needs?</h5>
<p>There are two key reasons: Firstly, we have made the significant investment to link our back offices which enable us to offer such a flexible solution, and secondly, because of who and what we are; we have huge currency positions and balances in a broad range of geographies. Our footprint, depth and business diversity in multiple geographies means we are very well placed to manage customers’ positions as part of our overall balance sheet. Neither reason would be sufficient in itself, but together they make a compelling proposition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Cross-currency, cross-border pooling, or the ‘Holy Grail’ as it is often called, is and always was a bit of a myth.”</p>
<p><cite>Yera Hagopian, Senior Product Manager, Liquidity Services</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="do-you-have-a-solution-which-provides-for-full-set-off-of-balances-across-this-multiple-bank-account-structure">This all sounds very positive Yera. Are you saying multi-bank, multi-currency, multi country and multi-legal entity liquidity management solutions are a reality today? Let me be even more specific. I am a multinational company with trade flows in 20 different currencies, including some ‘exotics’ operating in 30 countries across different time zones with three Regional Treasury Centres. Do you have a solution which provides for full set-off of balances across this multiple bank account structure?</h5>
<p>Cross-currency, cross-border pooling, or the ‘Holy Grail’ as it is often called, is and always was a bit of a myth. Let’s face it, the number of countries in which a bank can net the balances of different legal entities of a company and, furthermore, report these on a net basis for its own regulatory capital reporting is very limited. If the bank can’t, then pooling in the strict sense of the word is not economic to offer to customers. After all, the bank will be incurring a cost of capital on the customers’ debit balances which it will
not be able to pass onto the customer. So, what is actually called pooling in many countries is not really pooling at all.</p>
<p>Our solution is best described as interest optimisation whereby credit and debit balances are priced incorporating a significantly narrowed margin to the extent that they are equal and opposite. You probably detected I deliberately didn’t use the term ‘offset’. If we understand this, we can easily see that this approach can be extended across many countries and currencies.</p>
<p>The solution to which you allude is therefore possible subject to country regulations, the pace of our roll-out of back office connectivity and the extent to which we can include third party bank balances via bi-lateral agreements and SWIFT connectivity.</p>
<h5 id="how-does-hsbc-see-the-future-for-corporate-liquidity-management-or-has-it-gone-far-enough">Robin, how does HSBC see the future for corporate liquidity management or has it gone far enough?</h5>
<p>Actually, it is surprising how neglected liquidity management still is. It is far easier to argue over the cost of an individual transaction and leave the liquidity to manage itself – a classic case of the ’tail wagging the dog.’ There is almost a tacit agreement that the balances compensate for the transactional business but how much are the balances worth or indeed what are the balances? No one seems to know. However, there are signs the market is waking up and more and more transactional business is being awarded on the basis of good liquidity management tools. Another development we see is the integration of automated investment tools with liquidity solutions to optimise interest earnings on surplus cash balances. HSBC is developing these STP capabilities in conjunction with its new global liquidity platform and in the case of passive management it will shortly be possible to invest via an automated sweep in HSBC’s Global Liquidity Funds operated by our colleagues at HSBC Investments.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-these-sit-with-a-global-liquidity-management-approach">Yera, we hear much about internal drivers within organisations. How do these sit with a global liquidity management approach?</h5>
<p>Some of the internal issues were mentioned in response to an earlier question but are we really saying that companies cannot implement the solutions they choose? We read a lot about demonstrating the Return on Investment or ROI of a particular solution. It’s our view that there has to be something in it for all parties. In liquidity management terms, this means some of the interest benefit must be passed back to the participants. They must not just be able to see the benefit; they must be able to feel it. This is actually good practice from a tax and accounting perspective too.</p>
<h5 id="where-does-this-fit-with-a-liquidity-structure">What about cash flow forecasting Yera – where does this fit with a liquidity structure?</h5>
<p>Accurate forecasting is, of course, highly desirable yet often hard to achieve. It is important from an intra day liquidity management perspective and certainly vital in terms of managing the longer term positions. In terms of the day-to-day liquidity there has to be some margin of error; unexpected payments and/or receipts happen. Passive liquidity management as we call it must have the effect that errors in the forecasts do not prove disastrous.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-these-impact-liquidity-management-structures">And what about the external factors such as SEPA, increased regulation, lack of tax and legal harmonisation? Yera, how do these impact liquidity management structures?</h5>
<p>All of these have different drivers. None of these has improved corporate liquidity management as its primary aim. Will SEPA mean that corporations only need a single Euro account? Well probably no in most cases, although, there may be circumstances where bank account rationalisation is possible. The adoption of the EU Insolvency Directive has done a great deal to harmonise the ability to include European entities in a notional pool in ‘pool-friendly’ locations but is, as you say, lacking and indeed in some jurisdictions there is evidence that the authorities are adopting wider powers to safeguard their fiscal flows and domestic shareholders. We shouldn’t be too surprised, however, and that is just in the Euro zone.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-the-new-solutions-being-developed-by-hsbc-overcome-these">Tax, legal and regulatory issues involved with pooling structures have, in the past, prevented the type of holistic solution you have been talking about. Yera, how do the new solutions being developed by HSBC overcome these?</h5>
<p>We are not trying to overcome tax and regulatory constraints per se. We are simply trying to work within these to provide the best possible solution to our customers. That said, without offering specific tax advice we do keep abreast of developments in these important areas and offer advice and guidance to our clients on any potential pitfalls.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-satisfy-a-multi-bank-structure-to-ensure-the-company-derives-optimal-benefit">Transaction services of the type mentioned earlier tend to be allocated on the basis of the provision of credit from the banks. Given the solution you have described works best with a single bank provider I assume, Robin, how do you satisfy a multi-bank structure to ensure the company derives optimal benefit?</h5>
<p>A single bank relationship globally is rather ambitious and would entail a great many compromises so we recognise the need for multi-bank solutions. In less regulated and liquid markets, there are techniques utilising SWIFT for moving liquidity between banks on an automated basis. In more regulated markets this is harder to achieve. Transaction services are not the only bonbons in the corporate party bag however. If the benefits of a global liquidity solution are sufficiently large, a more creative approach to bank remuneration might be needed.</p>
<h5 id="what-would-you-say-would-be-different-from-today">Finally, Robin, if you were to predict the liquidity management solutions in say three years time, what would you say would be different from today?</h5>
<p>Greater automation is a given but also less of a lottery when it comes to the outcome. We worry a great deal about the process of liquidity management but the only thing which really matters is the outcome. The treasurer should know the worst case scenario he/she will earn and/or be charged X on credit and/or debit positions and this should be a predictable outcome rather than the uncertainty which exists today.</p></div>

<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Marilyn Spearing</h4>
<h5 class="title">Global Head of Trade Finance and Cash Management Corporates</h5>
<img alt="Deutsche Bank" class="logo org" height="18" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/deutsche-bank-logo-2011-120x18.png" width="120"/>
<p>Marilyn Spearing joined Deutsche Bank last year as Global Head of Trade Finance and Cash Management Corporates. Marilyn has over 25 years experience in the banking industry, having previously been Head of Sales, Global Transaction Banking at HSBC and been at Barclays earlier in her career. Marilyn is also a board member of SWIFT.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-led-you-to-join-deutsche-bank-recently">What led you to join Deutsche Bank recently?</h5>
<p>Deutsche Bank takes a long-term view on transaction banking services and has invested heavily in the past to stay well ahead of the game. I was always watching them. Deutsche Bank’s ongoing growth on a global scale provides an attractive set of new challenges for me and I am excited to be involved in the bank consolidating its position as a global transactor with a leading footprint in the European home market. It is a great opportunity with a great bank.</p>
<h5 id="so-it-was-the-attraction-of-being-able-to-grow-a-business-and-have-some-impact">So it was the attraction of being able to grow a business and have some impact?</h5>
<p>Even more than that. Deutsche Bank truly integrates its transaction banking business units and fosters cross-divisional client delivery. A good example is the closely aligned cash management and trade finance delivery, which I now have the privilege to develop beyond our established stronghold to build upon growth areas such as the States, Brazil, Eastern Europe and Asia. Frankly put, cash and trade can’t be run in isolation.</p>
<h5 id="does-deutsche-really-have-the-ability-to-become-a-global-player">Does Deutsche really have the ability to become a global player? The argument would go there’s only going to be a few in that space, some are very close to being there already and to get there – and stay there – is going to take a lot of investment.</h5>
<p>With a presence in 73 countries, Deutsche Bank is already an established global player. In my view, it is not so much about being physically present in every single market worldwide, it is being able to provide solutions for clients operating in these countries. We listen very carefully to what our clients’ needs are and in which regions they want comprehensive transaction banking services. This is where we are focusing our ongoing investments and activities, notably Western and Eastern Europe, the Americas and Asia.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-your-thoughts-on-that">Deutsche is a strong player in Europe and this could be seen as a strength or a weakness with the introduction of SEPA. SEPA is leading to a need for a lot of expenditure on new systems and at the same time the revenue line is under attack from the regulators. What are your thoughts on that?</h5>
<p>We’ve made significant investments here. This started a few years back and will be ongoing. We clearly view SEPA as an opportunity. Very few banks in Europe can match Deutsche Bank’s scale, network reach and technological capabilities and SEPA will give us the opportunity to continue to expand our leadership.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our wholesale solutions team are looking at those players who either do not wish to invest in SEPA, or simply do not have a financially justifiable business case to do so. They might want to use a partner bank. Other banks around the world are saying ‘how do I access Europe in the future?’</p>
<h5 id="it-is-a-big-opportunity-for-your-correspondent-banking-business">So, it is a big opportunity for your correspondent banking business.</h5>
<p>Yes, exactly right. We are able to offer solutions ranging from relatively light partner banking services, through front-end white labelling, to more comprehensive payment infrastructure solutions. So it’s a nice staged proposition we’ve put together.</p>
<p>New regulations are set to drive down profitability, but the forecasts are for volume growth. So it’s a question of how we participate. We are looking to keep growing our share within a market that is becoming characterised by consolidation. Scale, scope and technological capabilities play a major role here and we are seeing many leading corporates selecting Deutsche Bank as consolidator of choice to gain the maximum benefits from centralisation.</p>
<h5 id="how-will-the-banking-industry-ever-get-the-big-volumes-of-domestic-payments-to-move-to-the-new-clearing-systems">SEPA does not seem to be providing a big value add to the corporate. How will the banking industry ever get the big volumes of domestic payments to move to the new clearing systems?</h5>
<p>Admittedly for the heavy consumer collection orientated companies, it would be a far cry for SEPA to add value to them in the shortterm. Because of their situation, they’re heavily domestic in their collections and all of that is already lined up or it’s heavily in-country (by accessing domestic payment systems cross-border) and there’s not a huge amount that’s going to switch.</p>
<h5 id="they-will-be-using-a-cheap-and-efficient-ach-already">They will be using a cheap and efficient ACH already?</h5>
<p>Exactly, but on the business-to-business side, we think there are opportunities. They should have a rolled out schedule considering consolidating accounts. At the same time, they would have asked the question, how can I clean up the reconciliation and use the ‘pay on behalf of’ payments in order to clean up the outgoing payments as well as to eliminate in-country accounts? They may have been avoiding the cross-border charges that were always in place in this way.</p>
<p>Similarly, SEPA may be used as an initiator to streamline payment factories, shared service centres or in-house banks. The only drawback is – is it compelling enough? And I will admit that what we are hearing from certain organisations and clients is that they already have advanced treasury structures in place.</p>
<h5 id="the-banks-are-going-to-want-to-shut-down-the-domestic-clearing-systems">The banks are going to want to shut down the domestic clearing systems as soon as the SEPA system – or soon after – the SEPA systems are up and running.</h5>
<p>I don’t necessarily see an immediate folding down from some of the big economies where the ACHs are well advanced. However, there will clearly be a reduction from the 39 or so independent clearing systems currently in place today.</p>
<h5 id="so-you-are-seeing-a-multiple-pe-ach-environment">So you are seeing a multiple PE-ACH environment?</h5>
<p>Yes. If you look back to the States, it took about 20 years for all of those separate systems to consolidate into two ACHs.</p>
<h5 id="is-there-going-to-be-any-profitability-in-this-business">Is there going to be any profitability in this business?</h5>
<p>Yes, I think there is if your processing unit costs are at the right level. Plus, you’re still going to be based on the amount of accounts that you’re controlling and the corresponding put-through. And I think that’s where the profitability will be. This, however, will only be beneficial for the large players in the market.</p>
<h5 id="the-supply-chain-is-obviously-very-important">The supply chain is obviously very important given the fact that you’re running cash management and trade and its very much part of that. The banks seem to be trying to work their way up the trade cycle from the bottom where they are dealing with the payment at the end of the transaction. No bank has ever seemed to have found a way of doing that successfully.</h5>
<p>So far, I think that can be seen as a fair comment. The different treasurers that I have been talking to point out consistently that banks have a very small part of the efficiencies in the supply chain right now. What the banking world does, is clearly only a component and that’s why I have focused less on talking about supply chain as a broad topic, but rather tried to distil what we are building out from.</p>
<p>In my view, we are currently building out from documentary trade decreasing and moving towards open account. So far, we were taking in clients’ invoices and factoring them or financing them in some way. We are now looking at ways to collect that information better and feed it back to them. As a result, the invoice financiers can, in turn, better feed their systems. Then a value-added service of reconciliation goes along with the capturing of the invoice data and the financing. Their supply chain is, of course, a lot wider than that, but we are now, at least, in the position to benefit clients by combining innovative finance, channel management and our service excellence.</p>
<p>We are then seeing if we can offer any value adds to feeding logistics information down the same pipeline collaboratively with the various players. There are also other ideas. If we were to offer a service guaranteeing the trade cycle, but without having to go through the reams of paper, then that might be advantageous for trade situations where a company doesn’t want to go fully open account. So it all depends on what the relationship is between buyer and supplier.</p>
<h5 id="looking-to-the-future-what-are-you-priorities">Looking to the future, what are you priorities?</h5>
<p>There are four areas in which we’re investing. The first of which is SEPA, making sure we are there to catch the volume globally that we’re going to be intermediating through Europe.</p>
<p>The next is building from established trade and cash solutions into further value added, collaborative services, to assist clients on the supply chain stage.</p>
<p>The third investment for us is Asia. We already have processing and technology capabilities and we have a presence in 14 countries. We will now be looking to build on this position and leverage the overall growth in the Asian market.</p>
<p>Fourth, is our overall commitment to best in class practices. We’re going to keep making investments in technology and service provision, as well as our set of products. We will also be looking to optimise our processing centres and keep a close eye on how well they are ranked. In a nutshell, we will keep turning the dial up on efficiency.</p></div>

</div>
<h5 id="what-is-citis-global-transaction-services-cash-management-strategy-in-emea">What is Citi’s global transaction services cash management strategy in EMEA?</h5>
<p>The overarching goal is what we call our ‘client first’ initiative, which is really to put client needs at the centre of the plate. Our success will be driven by the extent to which we embed ‘client first’ in our day-to-day activities. In terms of the business strategy, we think about developing our business around client needs in five ways. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Managing our existing business.</h5>
<p>We have a strong fact based management discipline to make sure we operate efficiently as a business and maximise the value delivered to our clients. In Europe, Citi is enhancing its domestic capabilities to support domestic flows. This will complement our strong position in the cross-border flows and further address the needs of our customers both domestically and globally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Product expansion.</h5>
<p>Determining what kinds of new products and services clients are asking for and developing solutions to meet their needs. We have a strong track record in developing new innovations and business models, eg mobile payments through Vodafone and TreasuryVision, an information delivery solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Target market expansion.</h5>
<p>In many countries where we’ve previously only looked at the top tier clients, we have recently focused on broadening our reach to other customer segments, eg small and medium businesses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Alliances and Partnerships.</h5>
<p>This is a critical component of our strategy as it enables us to be more responsive to the market place by delivering comprehensive solutions while allowing us to tap into new distribution, product, processing opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Investment in Technology.</h5>
<p>Citi has invested significantly to ensure that our cash management operating model, infrastructure and platforms are consistent domestically, regionally and globally to provide a seamless and efficient experience for our clients.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="what-sort-of-an-impact-is-sepa-likely-to-have-on-this-strategy">What sort of an impact is SEPA likely to have on this strategy?</h5>
<p>We see the development of a Single Euro Payment Area as a fundamental market change. SEPA has the potential to transform the way in which all the players do business. The biggest thing that we see happening is a reduction in the friction that currently exists when businesses and people are trying to make cross-border payments within the Eurozone. The existing directives have gone some way towards reducing the friction, but the emergence of SEPA is likely to get us much closer to something resembling a domestic market for payments. It changes the landscape for each of our client segments in slightly different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For governments, we see it as very important they embrace SEPA in their own payments operations, because their participation can help the adoption of these types of schemes. In doing so, they will also gain greater efficiency in payments and related processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For corporates, SEPA allows for a varied degree of centralisation, depending on their business strategy and evolution of the treasury and commercial model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For financial institutions, we see SEPA as being both a challenge and an opportunity. The significant and constant investment needed to build and maintain a payments infrastructure means that the arrival of SEPA represents an opportunity for banks to re-evaluate their business models and decide whether future investment in payment products and systems is necessary and sustainable. We see SEPA heralding a wave of outsourcing of transaction processing to a few key players.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="will-sepa-be-genuinely-useful-to-corporates">Will SEPA be genuinely useful to corporates?</h5>
<p>We believe so. At the moment, if someone wants to do business throughout the Eurozone there’s still the need to have domestic bank accounts in each country. SEPA isn’t going to completely eliminate the need for domestic bank accounts; however, we do think that over time the introduction of SEPA will enable companies to simplify their account structures. They’re obviously going to benefit from the economics of making SEPA payments compared to the existing ways of making payments within the Eurozone.</p>
<p>Having said that, there are some other things that have to fall into place. Other types of harmonisation are taking place in areas such as central bank reporting and tax environments, and these things together with SEPA will help corporates operate more efficiently within Europe. SEPA is not the whole story, but it is part of a general trend towards harmonisation that will enable corporates to act more as if the Eurozone is a single country.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-citi-doing-in-the-financial-supply-chain-area">What is Citi doing in the financial supply chain area?</h5>
<p>In the corporate space, treasurers are becoming much more interested in what they can do to influence the financial supply chain, because there’s a great deal of value locked up in supply chains that can potentially be unlocked with relatively minor modifications. Most people are still sending and receiving purchase orders and invoices in paper and processing them manually. In these days of globalisation, where companies’ operations and suppliers are scattered around the world, it is possible to cut down a lot of the inefficiencies in the supply chain by making the connectivity between the parties in the chain electronic.</p>
<p>This is something that we are trying to help out with in a couple of different ways. One example is in the supplier financing area, which has been around for a while but which is getting more focus now. Corporates can basically use their credit rating to help out their suppliers. The vendor receives payment sooner but the buyer still pays at the same time that they had agreed within their commercial terms. Another example is in terms of providing electronic banking services that interact with our customers’ ERP and TMS systems, to give them visibility of what’s happening. The centralisation of treasury activities has made it easier to see where the efficiencies and inefficiencies are in the financial supply chain, so you’re able to get much greater visibility over where you can introduce an automated solution rather than a paper based solution to speed up the process.</p>
<p>We do see a growing revival of interest in e-invoicing solutions. While e-invoicing is not part of the core SEPA agenda it’s something that the regulators in the Eurozone are very keen to see take off. It’s an ideal that’s been around for a while, and during the dotcom years many a player burned their fingers in trying to launch e-invoicing solutions a little ahead of their time. But now we see a revival in interest in e-invoicing solutions, and that’s something that we are looking at very closely. Standards have still got a way to go before these solutions become widely adopted, but we see that as part of the trend towards harmonisation and standardisation of which SEPA is also a part.</p>
<h5 id="what-trends-are-happening-in-your-clients-markets">What trends are happening in your clients’ markets?</h5>
<p>Let me start with the public sector market. What we see amongst the governments is a desire to learn from corporate best practice. We’ve been able to make a pretty interesting parallel here between a multinational company and a government. A multinational corporate has got a head office and sometimes hundreds of subsidiaries in different countries. Structurally, a government tends to have a number of central departments and then hundreds of agencies which are satellites of those central departments.</p>
<p>We’ve been looking at what’s been happening in the corporate market over the past 20 years and what governments can learn from that. For example, corporates have been centralising their treasuries, ie taking the treasury function out of the local subsidiaries and organising it centrally. That’s also something that we see has merit in the government market. Corporates have also been implementing TMSs and ERP systems to get centralised control over the full span of their activity. The same types of systems have applicability in government. The third thing, and perhaps most important, is the establishment of shared services centres which provide services to the whole organisation. We see a big trend in government towards the creation of shared service centres. We’ve been trying to encourage much more dialogue between the best practice practitioners in the corporate market with the people in governments who are trying to move in this direction, and I think it’s going to be a very fruitful approach.</p>
<p>The trends in the corporate market are also very interesting. Treasury centralisation is one background trend, and that’s pretty well understood by most of the people in the market. The trend behind this is really globalisation. Globalisation means that you can deconstruct an organisation and put the pieces in the most appropriate location, irrespective of geography. We’ve seen the emergence of China as the factory of the world, India as the IT centre of the world. This trend hasn’t run its course yet.</p>
<p>There’s a possibility that treasury centralisation might go in another direction. You might actually start to see the decentralisation of some functions, because of the greater interest in the supply chain. If you want to maximise the supply chain it can be very useful to have the local knowledge, with people on the ground in certain places. What enables this to happen is technology.</p>
<p>What we are seeing with financial institutions is a slight change in mindset. Financial institutions are very self reliant, but over the past couple of years they’ve also been looking at what they do themselves and what they outsource. Financial institutions are increasingly looking at core functions, for example payments processing, in the context of SEPA and the costs of keeping up with the regulations, and are beginning to ask themselves whether or not they really should have the infrastructure for processing payments. Every financial institution needs to offer payment services and transaction processing services to their clients, but that doesn’t mean that they have to run everything by themselves. A number of banks are starting to look at the outsourcing of the technology involved in transaction banking.</p>
<h5 id="what-developments-are-taking-place-in-terms-of-market-infrastructures">What developments are taking place in terms of market infrastructures?</h5>
<p>There are some interesting developments around the world. Historically countries had high value clearing systems and low value clearing systems. One of the clear trends is the consolidation of these. In the UK, for example, we have the low value BACS system and the high value CHAPS system, but we’re now developing something called Faster Payments, which is a payment mechanism which will get payments to the beneficiary within 15 seconds. In the fullness of time we anticipate migration from the BACS and CHAPS systems towards the Faster Payments system. And that same trend is happening around the world.</p>
<p>The other trend in the SEPA area is the consolidation of national ACHs, because ultimately within the Eurozone we’re only going to have a very small number of clearing systems. There’s currently a lot of redundancy in the number of clearing systems that we have within the Eurozone and in order to make Europe a more efficient place to do business that needs to change.</p>
<h5 id="what-impact-is-the-economic-climate-having-on-your-clients">What impact is the economic climate having on your clients?</h5>
<p>The financial markets are very buoyant at the moment. All of the major economies around the world are doing well, and there’s an enormous amount of liquidity in the system. When things are going well in this way, the competitive pressure is to go for growth. Efficiency is the goal in tight markets where everyone is going after the same pie, but in today’s economy you have massive middle classes emerging which means a lot more consumers. The nature of competition is to capture that growth.</p>
<p>We think this has an implication in terms of what treasurers focus their time on. What role can the treasurer play in helping companies take advantage of the opportunities around the world? We think that the treasury function is part of the engine room of the company, and the way in which that is set up can either be an enabler of growth or a constraining factor. So we are starting to talk to treasurers about what they’re doing to support their companies in their growth plans in addition to continue to look for efficiencies.</p>
<h5 id="what-developments-are-happening-in-the-area-of-mobile-payments">What developments are happening in the area of mobile payments?</h5>
<p>We have a vision that mobile payments will become ubiquitous in a relatively short space of time – maybe in three to five years. If you look around the world, there are scores of initiatives going on in this space. In South Africa you have a bank called Wizzit, fully based on mobile telephones, which is becoming very successful. Then in Kenya, you have the Vodafone scheme called M-PESA, which was launched a couple of months ago. The takeup of mobile telephones in emerging markets is enormous, partly because the fixed line infrastructure isn’t there and partly because of the convenience and cheapness of putting in place the mobile infrastructure. So it’s been natural in those countries to develop banking solutions and payment solutions based upon the mobile telephone.</p>
<p>Citi is very engaged in the mobile payments space. We’ve created the world’s first mobile based remittance platform in conjunction with Vodafone, which is going live at the end of this month between the UK and Kenya. In the US we have also launched Citi Mobile, which is an electronic banking platform on the mobile telephone.</p>
<p>When you think about a treasurer and the kind of technology that a treasurer interacts with – TMSs, electronic banking systems, ERP systems – all of these systems are very deskbound. But the treasurer has to be out and engaged in the business. So we also see a latent need to enable treasurers to do their jobs on the go. So far we haven’t seen the development of mobile solutions in this area, but it’s something that we’re very interested in – what kind of tools could we put in place to enable treasury staff to do their job on the go? I think this could be an interesting area of innovation for the future.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Shared Service Centres (SSCs) have been an area of interest for companies and banks around the globe for many years.  Citigroup has been a pioneer in implementing SSCs in China.  In the following paragraphs, Frank Xing and Alan Lin from Citigroup share their China experience of recent years, provide practitioner’s market insights, highlight aspects of the current situation and discuss the future of SSCs.</p>

<img alt="Citi" class="logo org" height="29" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/citi-logo-2010-50x29.png" width="50"/>
<p>Frank Xing is a Shanghai native who joined Citigroup in 2001. Frank heads Citigroup Global Transaction Services receivables and delivery channel product lines, armed with years of experience and a Bachelor of Science degree in Communication and Engineering from the Shanghai Industry and Technology University.</p>
<p>With a very sound knowledge of accounting processes, Frank develops, designs and implements e-Banking solutions that interface with most, if not all ERP systems.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="how-have-sscs-developed-in-china">How have SSCs developed in China?</h5>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>Alan Lin:</span>  We have observed both Multinational Companies (MNCs) and large local Chinese companies implementing Shared Service Centres (SSCs). MNCs began to set up SSCs in China by bringing their best practice from outside China. In general, the MNCs that came to China concentrated on domestic sales or used China as a manufacturing hub for exports.</p>
<p>In respect of those MNCs concentrating on the domestic market, we observed that they started operating as single entities with simple structures. At that time, prior to 2000, they needed very basic banking services. After initial success, they wanted to expand their operations. Local government autonomy resulted in encouragement to MNCs to set up entities locally in each province. In this way, the MNCs expanded geographically and ended up with multiple entities. Each of these entities independently performed identical treasury functions, thereby missing the opportunity of achieving synergies with affiliated entities. At this time, these companies’ group headquarters looked towards centralisation for control and transparency of their entities’ financial operations.</p>
<p>These companies carry out centralisation by implementing the two prevailing models:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>treasury centres.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SSCs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While there is consensus that both models are important, when a company evaluates which model to pursue, we have observed that a smaller group of companies are motivated to select the SSC solution by the need to centralise or by their respective company preference. The bigger group would normally choose a cash pooling treasury centre as a first step and then naturally move towards the SSC model as their treasury functions progress towards a more sophisticated state. However, some of the companies in this bigger group first need to agree internally with all stakeholders. I would emphasise that RMB cash pooling is not a difficult solution to implement and is very cost effective. We believe that the SSC and treasury centre models will in time converge because implementing both models is the only way to truly optimise the benefits that these models are capable of generating.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span>Frank Xing:</span>  The service scope of an SSC is much wider than a treasury centre, which normally focuses on liquidity management. There are also differences in terms of set-up. In China, a treasury centre can rely on a bank’s system to consolidate funds and information, while in an SSC there is also a lot of activity at the client end. The bank’s clients need to have a sophisticated system and solutions in-house for an SSC.</p>
<p>The foremost requirement is that the client requires an Enterprise Resource Plan (ERP) system. The second is that the client needs to have a working relationship with a bank that can provide a total solution, i.e. a bank that has a thorough understanding of SSCs and that is able to provide seamless system integration for the flow of information.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-techniques-can-companies-use-to-centralise-their-cash-in-china">What techniques can companies use to centralise their cash in China?</h5>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>Alan Lin:</span>  As interest rates in China are regulated – and the spread between the bank lending rate and deposit rates are relatively larger than elsewhere – through centralisation, group companies with multiple entities can benefit from the efficient use of cash from other entities within the group.</p>
<p>Inter-company lending is only permitted through ‘Entrust Loans’, where a bank acts as the agent of the depositor (‘the principal’) and on-lends the principal’s entrusted funds to a borrower designated by the principal. Entrust loans are the basis of a cash pooling arrangement, ie a structure whereby funds are physically swept to/from a number of subsidiaries into a header account. Cash pooling without the physical movement of cash is presently not permitted.</p>
<p>Cash pooling results in savings for the entire group. Citigroup has developed a value added feature to allocate group savings to individual group entities based on a pre-defined mechanism. As the objective is to optimise the spread for the group on an overall basis, we have observed that this has had an impact in reducing internal resistance to the implementation of a centralisation model.</p>
<p>Foreign currency in China is regulated. Companies are required to open different foreign currency accounts for different purposes – such as capital, loan and settlement accounts, among others. Therefore, each group entity may end up with multiple accounts.</p>
<p>The government recently extended the cash pooling regulations to permit foreign currency cash pooling. On meeting certain regulatory requirements, a group may apply to conduct foreign currency cash pooling. There are two key benefits to foreign currency cash pooling. Firstly, it is possible to self-fund, which is the same as under RMB cash pooling. The second benefit arises from savings generated by offsetting internal buy and sell needs amongst group entities. Foreign currency cash pooling creates value by avoiding the additional costs of external transactions.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-services-are-offered-by-a-typical-ssc-in-addition-to-cash-pooling">What services are offered by a typical SSC in addition to cash pooling?</h5>
<div class="person n2">
<span>Frank Xing:</span>
<h5 id="payment-solutions">Payment Solutions</h5>
<p>Payment solutions are the most basic and broadly used service in an SSC. Normally, invoices are processed by the relevant group entity using the group’s ERP system and subsequently processed by the SSC. The alternative is for everything to be done in the SSC. Either way, once the payment file is produced, the file needs to be sent to the service provider for payment. There are then two options for data exchange:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Manual uploading of the file to the bank’s e-banking portal.</h5>
<p>After invoices are processed, payment instructions are consolidated and sent to the bank on a weekly (or other schedule) basis, using a payment instruction file uploaded through Citigroup’s e-banking portal. Based on our SSC client statistics, 80% of clients use file up and download.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>End-to-end automation.</h5>
<p>The other 20% will directly push the file to the bank from their ERP system and the bank processes the file automatically. There is no manual intervention in this process and it improves the workflow.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The next important step is reconciliation. There are two ways for a client to reconcile their Accounts Payable (A/P) records after transferring the payments from the ERP system to the banking system. One is that just after their ERP system issues the payment to the bank, they close the A/P record. Around 45% of clients opt for this method. The remaining clients hold the A/P book status open until the bank sends confirmation and advises that payment has been released and the account debited.</p>
<p>Citigroup offers an added value service that provides an e-mail to beneficiaries, notifying them that payment has been processed. Approximately 70% of clients subscribe to the beneficiary e-mail advice service.</p>
<h5 id="collection-solution">Collection Solution</h5>
<p>In a basic receivable solution, the payment information received from the payer is routed through the bank interface to the SSC’s ERP system and then to the sub-entity’s account. Roughly 25% of SSC clients use this collection service. In the basic solution, the payer name is used for the reconciliation of payee details with the receivable records. It can be difficult to match the payer name and receivable records due to the different possible ways of interpreting a single Chinese expression.</p>
<p>In order to avoid any problems in reconciliation, Citigroup offers an enhanced receivable solution through Virtual Accounts for payer level auto reconciliation. In this solution, the payer can make a payment to the SSC via a Virtual Account that is a combination of the SSC’s regular bank account number and payer reference codes. The benefit is that once the payer has deposited the payment and the bank receives the payment after clearing, the bank extracts the reference code for consolidation in its report and sends this to the SSC for automatic Accounts Receivable (A/R) record reconciliation. Near 40% of those subscribing to the collection service are using Virtual Accounts (payer code).</p>
<p>A relatively new service that Citigroup has been offering is A/R reconciliation against invoices. This service is for clients who want to track payments against their invoices. This solution is already in place for some clients on a customised basis. Customisations of this kind enable SSCs to expand their scope from a traditional payment service provider to receivables and supply chain management.</p>
<h5 id="liquidity-management">Liquidity Management</h5>
<p>The liquidity management service is a function of the treasury centre. Out of nearly 100 liquidity structures that Citigroup has set up, over 30% have centralised payment functions, which is the core functionality of an SSC.</p>
<p>A new feature for cash pooling is tax efficient sweeping. When funds are swept in a cash pooling structure, for every movement of funds, according to Chinese regulations, the borrowing entity is required to pay withholding tax on the interest due.</p>
<p>Citigroup has developed a solution to avoid unnecessary fund movements. Compared to a zero balance cash pooling structure, which will often sweep more funds than needed, tax efficient sweeping allows companies to sweep only as much as needed. Currently 20% of cash pooling clients are using this method.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-solutions-does-citigroup-offer-to-companies-working-with-more-than-one-bank">What solutions does Citigroup offer to companies working with more than one bank?</h5>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span>Frank Xing:</span>  As China is a very large country, there is no single bank that can meet all the requirements of a single major client, so the subsidiaries within a group may have banking relationships with several banks. Citigroup offers a multi-banking service to its clients by which the back-end systems of all partner banks are connected. The benefit to the SSC is that it is able to transact from accounts with other banks through Citigroup’s e-banking interface. As solution requirements grow more complicated, a multi-banking services solution has become more important than ever before. The service has been available for three years and has grown with the increase in SSCs.</p>
<p>Through the multi-banking platform, cross–bank sweeping is also possible.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="how-receptive-are-chinese-companies-towards-sscs">How receptive are Chinese companies towards SSCs?</h5>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>Alan Lin:</span>  MNCs began to set up SSCs by importing their best practices to China. Local Chinese companies also began to set up SSCs. While both MNCs and Chinese companies share some common objectives when setting up an SSC, there are key differences in the reason for setting up an SSC. MNCs want to provide services to subsidiaries within China or overseas and are driven by factors such as cost, potential savings, human resources and services. Chinese companies mainly use SSCs to serve overseas subsidiaries as they invest funds and have retail activities overseas. Through SSCs, they can see what happens there and consolidate funds at HQ level. This brings the benefit of a more standard process and more security. Currently among SSC clients, 90% are MNCs and 10% are local companies.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span>Frank Xing:</span>  On an overall basis, the SSCs established by companies are divided into three categories – serving locally, regionally and globally. The percentages of this division are 45%, 40% and 15% respectively.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-have-been-the-major-challenges-in-promoting-the-ssc-business-in-china">What have been the major challenges in promoting the SSC business in China?</h5>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>Alan Lin:</span>  The major challenges we have experienced so far have been dealing with a group’s internal resistance to implementing an SSC and the diversity of requirements of different entities. Citigroup has different parameters for each client and using a variety of solution components, in practical terms, we implement a separate customised solution for each client. We help meet the diverse needs of entities, by helping our clients to integrate their ERP systems with our interface.</p>
<p>The key is to have good project management discipline and a dedicated implementation team. Knowing and managing the details has been the key for success factor for Citigroup in this regard.</p>
</div>
<h5>How does Citigroup assist the potential client at different stages in the evaluation, decision–making and implementation of an SSC?</h5>
<div class="person n1">
<p><span>Alan Lin:</span>  Citigroup offers assistance to the client at all stages of setting up an SSC, from conception to implementation. The scope of service varies from client to client, depending on the client’s familiarity with the concepts and experience in making group–wide decisions. The decision to opt for an SSC in the case of most of the MNCs is done at headquarters outside China, as part of the company’s global initiative. As a result, Citigroup tends to be an execution only partner in these cases. On the whole, local entities of MNCs have not carried out much background study and basic evaluations. However, they do have knowledge of the concept, mainly learnt through experiences at other locations. Normally, the clients issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to initiate the formal process and then, by mutual discussion, the scope of work at each end is decided. For local companies, the bank actually has a consultant role throughout the process and it is a lot more than a service provider.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="are-there-any-new-regulatory-developments-on-the-horizon-of-which-treasurers-should-be-aware">Are there any new regulatory developments on the horizon of which treasurers should be aware?</h5>

<p><span>Alan Lin:</span>  The Chinese Government is following a consistent policy of deregulation and has made significant progress towards liberalising the financial and banking sector in the last few years. In particular, the Pudong Nine Measures in December 2005, FX Reform in April 2006 and a series of other liberalising measures in 2006 have all allowed qualifying companies to facilitate foreign currency treasury management, including permission to undertake foreign currency cash pooling.</p>

<div class="person n1">
<p><span>Alan Lin:</span>  Clients are getting bigger and more sophisticated – the result is that their service requirements are getting more complicated. At the same time, globalisation has made it much easier for companies to have a presence throughout the world. All of this is supported by the practice of using a single (or a very small number of) SSCs. Correspondingly, treasurers need to have quicker and more comprehensive access to information from all over the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="person n2">
<p><span>Frank Xing:</span>  Citigroup received requests from clients to develop a solution enabling them to view liquidity positions throughout the world, regardless of where or in which bank those balances reside. Citigroup has developed the technological lead to obtain data from every group entity bank account and aggregate this information in a centralised database. The system provides a global view of the information, but also allows treasurers to perform a wide range of analytical functions.</p>
<p>The latest trend in China is to outsource SSC functions. We have seen that the number of companies providing outsourcing services is growing. Citigroup has been working together with our clients and their outsourcing service providers to create further efficiencies and savings wherever the opportunity exists.</p>

<div class="people right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Richard Moseley</h4>
<h5 class="title">Head of Global Transaction Banking, Corporates</h5>
<img alt="HSBC" class="logo org" height="29" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/hsbc-the-worlds-local-bank-2010-90x29.png" width="90"/>
</div>
<h5 id="what-are-the-hot-topics-with-your-customers-at-the-moment">What are the hot topics with your customers at the moment?</h5>
<p>There are two things which are upper most in the minds of most people in the treasury payments business today. Firstly, the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) and its implications and secondly – and more broadly – the expanding supply chain.</p>
<p>Let’s take supply chain first as it’s a broader subject and one getting a huge amount of coverage at the moment. People have different interpretations of what supply chain means and today it seems everything is being classified as supply chain whether it is or not. The definition of supply chain has become so broad that it can cover virtually anything involved in the business; from sourcing raw materials to selling to the end user.</p>
<h5 id="it-has-become-very-topical-but-is-there-a-good-reason-for-this">It has become very topical, but is there a good reason for this?</h5>
<p>I think the reason supply chain is the focus of so much attention, particularly the financial side, is that large corporates are continually looking at how they can reduce costs. As part of that process, they’re looking at the cost of goods purchased, understanding the costs which their suppliers have to bear, how they can influence the size of those costs and consequently the size of the cost of the goods that they are purchasing. For example, if a vendor is selling to an entity with the ability to pay and a good track record, a bank’s view of lending to that customer is going to be markedly different to a customer selling to a new customer with no history or track record.</p>
<p>When we ask large buyers about their financial wallet, we are finding that we should look at it more broadly. We need to understand the financial wallet of each of the elements in the cost of goods sold, which may be paid by their vendors to banks earlier in the chain.</p>
<p>So it’s an area where treasurers are beginning to connect more with the commercial side, which traditionally would be predominantly involved in managing down the cost of goods sold and handling the supplier relationships.</p>
<p>Banks need a consultative approach to understand how a company manages its relationships with suppliers. How big are the suppliers and where are the suppliers based? What’s the confidence level of the relationships with those suppliers? What opportunities could there be for a bank, with a presence in the supplier’s location, to help create a more effective package for all parties?</p>
<h5 id="are-you-saying-that-were-moving-on-from-working-capital-management">Are you saying that we’re moving on from working capital management?</h5>
<p>We used to look at working capital management. The next stage is to take a more holistic view, which means a company needs to understand supplier relationships to identify the impacts of changing your terms of trade to, for example, an industry best in class. We have helped a number of companies and their suppliers to do some modelling around this and it’s no surprise that this can have a huge impact on their balance sheet and working capital position.</p>
<h5 id="why-are-we-talking-about-doing-this-now-what-has-changed">Why are we talking about doing this now? What has changed?</h5>
<p>It’s partly that the technology available makes it so much easier to get visibility of where the supplier is in terms of supplying the goods. As companies gain this visibility, they start to realise there are opportunities to reflect the fact that if they have a good, longterm relationship with a vendor client, then that’s got a value to the financier of that vendor.</p>
<p>The other thing is with the increase in global trade, there are more companies doing business across boundaries. The greater a bank’s understanding of the two counterparties involved with a transaction, the more they can do to optimise the cost for both parties. So for a local bank in Indonesia with no knowledge of the buyer, it’s difficult for it to establish whether that buyer is good for the money.</p>
<p>If, like HSBC, a bank has established relationships with big buyers principally in North America and Europe, as well as strong relationships with many commercial customers in Asia, the ability to structure something to reflect the value of the buying capacity is very important.</p>
<p>It’s a combination of growth and international trade, desire to take out cost, moving away from letters of credit (LCs) to open account and wanting to get as much certainty as possible in an open account environment.</p>
<h5 id="i-can-see-how-that-works-if-youre-taking-out-a-local-bank-without-the-knowledge-of-the-other-end-of-the-transaction">I can see how that works if you’re taking out a local bank without the knowledge of the other end of the transaction. In simple terms, the big buyer leverages credit with its suppliers to get them cheaper finance, which in turn is reflected in a cheaper price for the supplier.</h5>
<p>Correct.</p>
<h5 id="swift-has-started-doing-some-work-in-this-area-recently-what-are-your-thoughts-on-that">Tracking the different stages of a supply of goods is still fundamentally quite difficult as there isn’t a commonly agreed system or set of standards in this space. SWIFT has started doing some work in this area recently, what are your thoughts on that?</h5>
<p>HSBC was one of the 19 original banks which signed up for SWIFT’s Trade Services Utility (TSU), one of the methods helping to take paper out of the system. Removing paper gives greater visibility and the ability to utilise information more effectively, which I think will be a big step forward. The challenge now, however, is to get other banks and customers to move forward along similar lines. But I think there has been strong progress and hopefully that will continue.</p>
<p>HSBC is developing other areas, where we use technology to convert paper into electronic documents with bar codes attached. This removes the paper element, enabling companies to take out cost from the process, while speeding up the process.</p>
<h5 id="what-would-you-be-recommending">What would you be saying to a treasurer who might not have done a lot of this to date, but understands the gains to be made from what you have just said? What would you be recommending?</h5>
<p>We would recommend the treasurer gets together with commercial executives within their organisation. As a bank, we would want to understand how they are doing business today and if there is an opportunity to optimise how they’re approaching supply chain at the moment. Then we would undertake some scenario work to establish whether their terms of trade could be changed to best in class, for example, to then identify the financial impact on that company’s ratios. This could have a significant impact on the overall financial standing of the company.</p>
<h5 id="you-also-wanted-to-talk-about-sepa">You also wanted to talk about SEPA.</h5>
<p>Yes, the major banks are all dedicating significant resource to understanding what SEPA will look like and, most importantly, how we can deliver value to both our clients and ourselves in the new environment.</p>
<p>Some recent figures from Capgemini indicate that volumes are increasing, but the direct payment revenues may come down 30%-60% of today’s revenues. That equates to around €13-29 billion, which is a huge sum of money. There are also estimates from McKinsey that it may cost between €80-150m for each bank to become SEPA compliant. I believe the range is actually going to be much broader than this, because it depends on a bank’s starting position.</p>
<p>It will also be interesting to see what SEPA prompts in terms of non-traditional competitors entering the payment space. Nontraditional competitors may begin to capitalise on opportunities to cherry pick niche pieces of business in this area, starting with a clean sheet of paper.</p>
<h5 id="sepa-is-really-being-driven-by-the-european-commission">SEPA is really being driven by the European Commission.</h5>
<p>The European Commission is keen to find ways to ensure lower pricing, greater transparency, increased speed, better information and enable individuals and businesses to benefit from fewer bank accounts. Like in the US economy, where all payments are treated as domestic, rather than having to think differently because a payment is going from one state to another. The Commission is a very powerful driver for change.</p>
<p>What’s fascinating here is trying to second guess the reaction in the market place to this fundamental change. Competition is going to increase because it’s going to become a volume game and therefore banks are going to be chasing the bigger players, pursuing increased volume.</p>
<p>Some small banks may have to exit the payments business as investment levels compared to potential revenue streams will become out-of-kilter. We may see some consolidation among banks, although this generally needs more drivers. I think we will see more outsourcing among those banks which can’t afford the investment, but need to find that capability, choosing to work with another bank to obtain that capability at a lower cost.</p>
<p>The trend of moving away from paper to digital will continue to increase as companies look at what can they do to take out cost. We will also see a focus on obtaining more value-added services. Payments will become increasingly commoditised as banks won’t see value in doing a payment per se. Banks will, at best, see recovery of cost, forcing them to offer other services on top, to provide value to the client and differentiate themselves, while profiting the bank. This focus on additional services will continue to grow.</p>
<h5 id="will-the-industry-be-ready-by-2008">Will the industry be ready by 2008?</h5>
<p>Most banks will be. HSBC is committed to becoming SEPA compliant by 2008. It’s going to be quite difficult for some of the smaller banks, however. It seems to me that it’s going to be a scale game. The good thing for clients is there will be major focus on value added services, which is exactly where the European Union (EU) wants the payments industry to go.</p>
<h5 id="what-should-a-corporate-be-doing-other-than-sitting-and-watching">What should a corporate be doing, other than sitting and watching?</h5>
<p>There are a number of simple things corporates can be doing now. First, they should make sure they have Bank Identifier Codes (BIC) and International Bank Account Numbers (IBAN) for as many of their customers as possible. They should also recognise that paper and cash is going to continue to be expensive and that the better the quality of payments data supplied to their bank, the lower the payment cost is likely to be.s</p>
<p>Corporates also need to identify which banks are making the investments in value added services. Do they genuinely add value to them and are they priced accordingly? I don’t see corporates today needing to make large investments like the banks are having to. I think it’s really the banks which have the biggest challenge. But corporates need to make sure they are positioned to gain maximum benefit from those changes. They should continue to assess the banks in terms of what they are doing in a certain market and the likely winners. Ultimately, a corporate doesn’t want to invest time and effort in a bank, which is not going to be successful in that market place.</p>
<h5 id="you-talk-about-value-added-services-what-are-they">You talk about value-added services, what are they?</h5>
<p>Much of it comes down to the level and usefulness of the information banks can provide. The value is working with a client to understand their transactions and then making them as straight through as possible into their systems. Then identifying areas which cannot be straight through and making these processes as easy to resolve as possible.</p>
<h5 id="this-is-information-outside-of-the-payment-and-its-reference-field">This is information outside of the payment and its reference field?</h5>
<p>It’s providing the base information which is expected, and then taking it a step further to format that information so it can be manipulated and linked through to the customer’s process for dealing with suppliers. We look to identify whether we can provide support on the payable financing side, effectively helping them to use information to gain some of the discounts available.</p>
<p>By integrating the information on both the accounts payable and receivable side, in not just one country but several, a treasurer could potentially use the information to improve cash flow by capturing better discounts. There may be some way of making payments to the supplier earlier as part of a payable financing facility or maybe with an accelerated discount capability.</p>
<h5 id="a-lot-of-which-could-have-been-done-without-sepa">A lot of which could have been done without SEPA?</h5>
<p>Oh absolutely. The point I’m making is that the focus on value-added services, which has been very visible over the last few years, will be increased as a consequence of the standard providing less earning potential on payments for the banks.</p>
<p>It’s the additional investment which is the value add investment. I think that if a bank has a big enough client base it can then invest some of those monies on that discretionary side. That’s also going to be driven by the market research that we do as a matter of course to identify where customers want to move. SEPA is just another catalyst for change – a big catalyst.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Michael Guralnick, Citigroup Global Transaction Services talks to us about the bank’s GTS strategy in Europe, including Eastern Europe.  He also discusses the themes under discussion with clients as well as the key challenges facing treasurers today.</p>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Michael Guralnick</h4>
<h5 class="title">Managing Director, Head of Client Relationship Management: Corporate &amp; Public Sectors, Europe, Middle East and Africa Citigroup Global Transaction Services</h5>
<img alt="Citi" class="logo org" height="29" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/citi-logo-2010-50x29.png" width="50"/>
<p>Michael Guralnick has been with Citigroup for over 21 years. During that time he has held senior roles in transaction services in Asia Pacific, CEEMEA (Central Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa), and Western Europe. Currently, Mr Guralnick has responsibility for designing the strategy and leading Citigroup’s Global Transaction Services (GTS) client relationship management business with corporate and public sector clients based in the 50+ countries across the EMEA region (Europe, Central Eastern Europe, and the Middle East and Africa). He is a member of the GTS EMEA Senior Management Operating Committee, the UK Association of Corporate Treasurers, and the British American Business Inc.</p>
<p>Prior to joining Citigroup, Mr Guralnick worked in Korea from 1978-1982 – first with the US Peace Corps and then with LG Ad Inc., where he was in charge of client development for key foreign subsidiaries based in Korea. Mr Guralnick graduated with honours from Georgetown University, in Washington D.C., from where he attained his Master’s of Science in Foreign Service (MSFS).</p>
</div>
<h5 id="how-would-you-describe-citigroups-global-transaction-services-gts-strategy-in-europe">How would you describe Citigroup’s Global Transaction Services (GTS) strategy in Europe?</h5>
<p>The cornerstone of Citigroup’s Transaction Services strategy in Europe is a client first approach to deliver the highest quality solutions and services to our clients. We meet this commitment by offering three core competencies to empower clients to meet their supply chain and working capital requirements: Cash Management, Trade Services and Finance, and Securities and Fund Services. In today’s complex transaction banking environment, these components are increasingly connected, uniquely positioning Citigroup to deliver the integrated solutions our clients require.</p>
<p>Citigroup has an established transaction services franchise in over 50 presence countries across Europe, the Middle East, Africa (EMEA), and over 100 countries globally. Central to our strategy across the EMEA region is a four-pronged goal: to be the employer of choice to our people; the provider of choice to our clients; the business partner of choice to our suppliers; and the neighbour of choice to the communities everywhere that we do business.</p>
<p>At Citigroup we are playing a leading role in numerous strategic initiatives across the EMEA region such as developing new liquidity structures for EU accession countries, enabling our clients’ shared service activities in Central and Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East, and designing new risk mitigation solutions in emerging countries such as Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>In Western Europe, we are already recognised by major multinationals, local corporates and the public sector as a strong partner, working with clients to streamline and optimise their liquidity management structures, helping them establish shared service centres and payment factories and providing multi-country receivables solutions. We see an opportunity to expand our domestic footprint through alliance partnerships with large local banks (eg Lloyds TSB in the UK and DZ Bank in Germany). By joining forces with these partners, we can better serve our clients with a robust integrated domestic offering that augments our regional and global cash management solutions.</p>
<p>In Central and Eastern Europe (ie; Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania) and beyond, we have long-established embedded domestic solutions and we continue to invest in partnerships with local banks, post offices, and our clients to innovate in these emerging markets. For example, in Poland we designed a domestic collections strategy called Unikasa allowing consumers to pay utility bills at kiosks and stores in addition to a collections, consolidation, reconciliation and receivables matching innovation called SpeedCollect Plus. The opportunity here is to transfer these emerging market innovations into Western Europe, which we are doing at a growing pace. The fact that Citigroup manages both Western Europe and the emerging European countries as one region helps us deliver new innovations to our clients quickly and seamlessly, regardless of where the ideas are generated.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-the-most-important-trends-in-treasury-in-2006">What are the most important trends in treasury in 2006?</h5>
<p>The following themes are centre of the plate in many of the discussions we are having with our clients:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Bank relationship consolidation.</h5>
<p>A key area of focus for many clients is the consolidation of banks and bank accounts within the region and globally. Many clients are in the midst of a strategic review of the feasibility of having a single primary bank per region. Some of their stated objectives include: leveraging their buying power with one bank, streamlining future price negotiations, controlling integration and regulatory reporting costs – which continue to increase – and ensuring their core transactional activity is shared amongst their core credit relationships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Liquidity and investments.</h5>
<p>Clients are reviewing their ability to globally concentrate cash or achieve interest optimisation in markets where there is trapped cash. Once achieved they want to actively do something with it while diversifying their investment vehicles. We are in the midst of many discussions with clients who want to adopt a ‘follow the sun’ liquidity management strategy, moving liquidity from region to region throughout the day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Changing role of treasury organisation.</h5>
<p>Our clients are focusing on how they can provide more extensive in-house banking and shared services to their own organisations and our long-term experience in supporting shared service centres allows us to provide tailored recommendations to our clients. TreasuryVision, Citigroup’s web-based cash management tool for corporate treasurers, has several key variables embedded within its architecture to assist these processes, such as cash flow forecasting, the ability to track debt and asset management positions, investments and bank accounts on a real-time basis. The regulatory environment and market infrastructure changes as well as growth in emerging markets have added a new complexity to the role of treasury.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Working capital management and supply chain optimisation.</h5>
<p>Clients are asking banking partners to assume more risk or provide faster information in order to help them do more business, especially in the emerging markets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Regulatory changes.</h5>
<p>The regulatory changes across the European Union, ie SEPA, MiFID (the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive), and Basel II, are leading clients to move from a decentralised approach to a pan-regional payment, collection and liquidity management strategy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Strategic cost management.</h5>
<p>The increasing competitiveness within the industry is driving our clients to look at reducing transaction fees and speeding up collections. There is renewed focus on end-to-end outsourcing wherever possible.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="what-do-you-see-as-the-key-challenges-currently-faced-by-treasurers">What do you see as the key challenges currently faced by treasurers?</h5>
<p>This is a very broad question and has specific answers for each client we work with. The key themes we are discussing with our clients centre on three areas.</p>
<p>The first challenge surrounds the topic of risk management and controls. The amount of time our clients spend today on regulatory reporting means that they need more knowledge-based tools to do their jobs faster and more efficiently to enhance their risk management approach to generate a more pristine control environment with enhanced due diligence.</p>
<p>A second challenge is the issue of global competitiveness and how our clients can achieve sustainable competitive advantage. Traditionally, our client’s competitors have been other global multinationals, yet, with today’s interconnected world, they can also be smaller international competitors from any continent or any country. Intensified global competitiveness is driving a focus on strategic cost management. Global cost management is a two-sided coin which requires a balancing act between having enough capital for sustainable profitability, and also having the ability to continue to invest in innovation, geographic expansion and continuous service quality improvements – critical components to achieving sustainable competitive advantage.</p>
<p>The last challenge is supporting the new, emerging treasury management models. Our clients are evolving country or regional treasury models to global structures and are seeking open messaging standards. There is increased focus on straight through processing and a need for flexibility in technology driven solutions.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-expect-the-introduction-of-the-single-euro-payments-area-sepa-to-impact-the-european-competitive-landscape-and-your-clients">How do you expect the introduction of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) to impact the European competitive landscape and your clients?</h5>
<p>SEPA is going to be an enabler for many of our clients’ objectives over the next few years. Broadly speaking, some of those goals and objectives are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Centralisation – centralised treasury, shared services and fewer bank accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liquidity optimisation – cash flow forecasting, interest optimisation and ease of reconciliation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efficiency – improved straight through processing, payment processes and reduced bank account fees.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the past 10 years, many of our clients have invested heavily in enterprise resource planning systems and treasury workstations and these new technologies are assisting them in gaining greater control over transactional activity, from connecting accounts globally to effecting payments centrally. Additionally, these new technologies, in conjunction with new global Internet banking platforms such as CitiDirect, provide clients access to information so they can make proactive liquidity management decisions. Citigroup’s GTS business is working hand-in-hand with many of these third party technology suppliers – many of whom are our clients as well – to ensure the banking technology and their technology seamlessly integrate to allow clients to derive maximum value from their investments. We are working with our clients in Europe to integrate our knowledge-based tools to help them realise the full potential of their systems. The approach Citigroup is taking is very much a consultative one, where our GTS relationship managers are in constant dialogue with clients to fully understand their corporate goals and discuss a structure to deliver the required results. As no two clients have the same goals, we feel it is important to take a personalised relationship management approach.</p>
<p>Some of our key SEPA related recommendations are for clients to fully embed the use of BIC and IBANs in their supply chain on both the sell and buy-side. SEPA will naturally lead to a simplification of account structures within Europe, and it will result in changes in the banking system (infrastructure, number of players, transaction costs) which will generate incremental value in the long-term. There may be a short-term cost of exploiting new instruments but long-term efficiencies will arise through process standardisation, centralisation and rationalisation of bank relationships.</p>
<p>SEPA supports Citigroup’s European strategy of offering single bank euro solutions, more simple account structures, enhanced remittance data and industry standard messages, providing us with a unique opportunity to create value-added payment services, enhanced reconciliation services and information reporting and financial supply chain integration tools for our clients.</p>
<h5 id="the-concept-of-supply-chain-management-is-being-talked-about-a-lot-at-the-moment–is-this-something-that-gts-has-focused-on">The concept of supply chain management is being talked about a lot at the moment – is this something that GTS has focused on?</h5>
<p>Structurally, our plan is to assist our clients in connecting their buyers and sellers – this is what drives our strategy – and is the foundation of our development of new innovative technology platforms to achieve these goals. We are very focused on developing new techniques that leverage our existing cash management solution components and services, and are developing a wide range of trade finance tools, which specifically pertain to emerging trends in supply chain management. Our approach focuses on the way our clients manage their global supply chains. In addition, the deployment of new trade capabilities within the supply chain addresses the primary goals for driving our clients’ businesses.</p>
<p>To start, we focus on the injection of liquidity into the supply chain to balance the dual goals of importers (buyers) and exporters (sellers), which facilitates inventory management objectives. Next is our approach to provide risk mitigation related to two primary risks – country and counterparty.</p>
<p>Our primary objective is to integrate existing and new trade-based solutions and services into the way that clients acquire, move, monitor and pay for goods in the supply chain. Successful deployment of financial supply chain solutions requires close coordination with multiple client stakeholders including procurement, logistics, finance, accounting, risk, and treasury with financial services partners, to complete their commercial cycle. In addressing the financial supply chain objectives of our clients, the Citigroup approach segments the goals of both importers and exporters.</p>
<p>There are three main aspects to supply chain optimisation: information management, technology connectivity and service. Information management and technology connectivity require providing clients maximum visibility with knowledge-based tools.</p>
<p>To assist our clients we have launched a knowledge-based information management tool called TreasuryVision. TreasuryVision allows clients to see their run accounts with us and with other banks they may use in a real time basis. Once clients have access to the information from all of their banking partners they can pay down debt, invest it, and move it to centres in order to use it more efficiently. TreasuryVision increases visibility and control so that treasury management professionals are able to make informed decisions relating to their overall financial positions. Not only does TreasuryVision aggregate the information flows in real time, it also provides robust analytic measurements allowing our clients to focus on optimising financial performance – not data gathering.</p>
<p>Over the last 15 years, we have seen a dramatic evolution in treasury management, and much of the change is driven by the advancements in technologies to allow treasury professionals to do their jobs faster, more efficiently and more effectively with more security and control. Today, our clients are looking for partners such as Citigroup who have the breadth of network, commitment to technology investment and importantly, skilled transaction services professionals, to help them design the right model for tomorrow, today.</p></div>

<h5 id="can-you-tell-me-more-about-hsbcs-cash-management-franchise-in-china">Can you tell me more about HSBC’s cash management franchise in China?</h5>
<p>Basically our mandate is to provide our target customers with the cash management product and services solution suite in China. HSBC has the largest branch network of any of the foreign banks, which consists of 12 branches and 11 sub branches across China. In total, 23 full branches and sub-branches. And we keep on expanding. My job is to provide cash management services within the coverage of this branch network. Basically we are talking about the account management, liquidity management and payments and receivables services – as well as delivering these through our branch network or our electronic delivery channel, which consists of an internet platform (HSBCnet) as well as a host-to-host platform (HSBC Connect).</p>
<p>In terms of the franchise, my target customers have always been the Foreign Invested Enterprises (FIEs) in China involving either multinationals or medium sized corporates – whether they are Wholly Owned Foreign Enterprises (WOFE) or joint ventures. Apart from FIEs, we are also targeting key State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and Private Owned Enterprises (POEs). These are Chinese enterprises, but they may have specific cash management needs inside China that their local banks may not be able to provide. On top, our experience shows that SOEs and POEs are also looking for cash management capabilities outside of China. Therefore, my role on this is to act as a bridge to bring to SOEs and POEs our payments and cash management capabilities across Asia Pacific or even globally.</p>
<h5 id="what-products-is-hsbc-currently-focusing-on-in-china">What products is HSBC currently focusing on in China?</h5>
<p>Let’s start with account structures. Based on our experience, we are in a very good position to provide our customers with all kinds of advice on how to structure their accounts among the groups of companies in China, in order to facilitate the efficiency and effectiveness of their payments and collections. Apart from that, we help our customers streamline their account operations – this includes local currency payments in renminbi as well as cross-border transactions.</p>
<p>The collections suite has been one of the key focuses. Linking into the China National Advanced Payment System (CNAPS) infrastructure as well as the coming new Bulk Electronic Payments System (BEPS) is also part of our payments and collections suite. If some of our customers want to outsource their accounts reconciliation process, we have the experience and the technology to provide this now in China.</p>
<p>On the liquidity management side, everyone knows that in China all inter-company loans have to be effected through the entrusted loan framework. We have a suite of products that address both renminbi and foreign currency funds sweeping automatically inside China. We are able to provide this to facilitate the liquidity management within a group of companies for our customers.</p>
<p>Finally, in terms of delivery platform, we have been at the forefront and are continually encouraging our customers to enjoy the internet banking service that HSBC can provide. Our global platform is called HSBCnet, which applies globally in most of the Asia Pacific countries as well as in China, with all the local language support. Of course, ultimately, it depends on what our customers’ needs are and what priority they have in terms of cash management – it may be collections first, liquidity second and payments last – or any other combination. It all depends on our customers’ specific business imperatives. We work accordingly to support them.</p>
<h5 id="what-do-you-see-as-the-key-challenges-faced-by-treasurers-in-china">What do you see as the key challenges faced by treasurers in China?</h5>
<p>The most important challenge that corporate treasurers need to be very alert to is keeping up with all the regulatory changes, advances and relaxations. Treasurers should do this almost on a monthly basis, adjusting their hedging strategies and cash management practices accordingly, to make sure they get the maximum benefit out of the changes. There have been several developments related to cash management – for example, the Pudong Nine Measures and the recent PBOC Six Measures. Among these measures, there are a lot of opportunities that corporate treasurers need to understand, from US dollar liquidity management inside China, to off-shore accounts inside China, to the overseas wealth management scheme, to a lot of other additional streamlining in foreign currency administration procedures in China. I think it is important for corporate treasurers to feel the pace of the changes and derive from that an expectation of the next milestone, so that they can start positioning themselves accordingly.</p>
<p>One of the other key challenges is collections in China. If any corporate is doing business in China, they need to collect sales proceeds from their customers. This has always been a challenging aspect of the corporate treasurer’s role.</p>
<p>There are two aspects here. The first is how quickly you get the money in – but even more important is the corresponding information about this credit. In China, this has been extremely manual when our customers’ customers remit the funds to our customers’ accounts to pay for goods. Usually they need to fax or verbally advise the corresponding information to our customers. At the same time, our customers need to check whether the money has been credited into the account and need to collect the information – for example, which invoice the customer is paying – in order to do the reconciliation. This is because of historical reasons as well as the infrastructure constraints of the clearing systems in China. This has been a big challenge and all international companies are trying to improve the situation. Progress is being made with the help of corporates, as well as international banks such as HSBC, but there are still ongoing challenges. This will only be remedied through better education to our customers’ customers in order to automate things as far as possible. With the help of the bank, to a certain extent the situation will be improved. But there’s still a challenge here.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-the-best-way-for-treasurers-to-keep-up-to-date-with-regulatory-changes">What is the best way for treasurers to keep up-to-date with regulatory changes?</h5>
<p>Treasurers should make sure that they keep on looking into the announcements that have been in the news, but I think the most effective way of keeping up-to-date is to get a constant feed of information from their bankers. The banks, either local or foreign, have a keen interest in everything that I have mentioned – understanding it, digesting it, and knowing what the implications are. If you get updates from the bank, you get the information and the implications, rather than just the data.</p>
<p>We keep a constant dialogue with our customers. Additionally, HSBC has been hosting a number of roundtables as a result of these measures. There is a fluid dialogue among corporates, banks and regulators to understand first-hand the implications of these exciting changes.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-expect-cash-and-treasury-management-practices-to-develop-in-china-in-the-next-few-years">How do you expect cash and treasury management practices to develop in China in the next few years?</h5>
<p>I think that with the pace of relaxation and with the coming WTO changes, there will be more and more success stories among multinationals working with foreign and local banks to achieve breakthroughs in terms of cash and treasury management in China. I’m expecting more and more onshore best practice to be evident in China. There have been a lot of centralised Shared Service Centres, regional treasury centres and payment factories in Hong Kong and Singapore. With all the good things happening in China, I expect there to be no more constraints preventing China from having a number of similar success stories.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-hsbcs-relationship-with-the-chinese-banks">What is HSBC’s relationship with the Chinese banks?</h5>
<p>HSBC was the first foreign bank in China to establish cash management alliances with local banks. At the moment, we have various degrees of alliance with the big five local banks. These are ICBC, Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, China Construction Bank and the fifth largest bank, the Bank of Communications. HSBC has a 19.9% equity interest in this fifth bank as well. We have a very good strategic alliance and partnership with these five banks in terms of cash management and we have been using this alliance to service our customers’ cash management needs in China.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-hsbcs-relationship-with-the-regulators-in-china">What is HSBC’s relationship with the regulators in China?</h5>
<p>We have an excellent relationship with the regulators. HSBC supports China’s reform strategy and actively contributes to the development of the banking sector. The fact that HSBC was the first to invest in domestic financial institutions and has the largest branch network testifies the support we have received from our regulators.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-expect-hsbcs-role-in-china-to-change-once-the-restrictions-on-foreign-banks-are-lifted-in-december-2006">How do you expect HSBC’s role in China to change once the restrictions on foreign banks are lifted in December 2006?</h5>
<p>By December this year, according to WTO, all the foreign banks will be able to serve Chinese individuals as well for their renminbi business, and this will open up another big business opportunity for HSBC. We have always been ready for this and I think the most important thing is to try to expand our branch network whenever we have the opportunity.</p>
<p>Also by December this year, according to the terms of the WTO agreement, foreign banks will no longer be limited by the core catchment area of our renminbi licence. When dealing with corporates, we will be able to serve any corporate in China with our branch network. It’s another relaxation and we will make sure that we leverage on that.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>BNP Paribas is a European leader in banking and financial services, with leading positions in Asia and a growing presence in the United States. It is the number one bank in terms of net income and market capitalisation in the euro zone. The group has one of the largest international banking networks throughout 87 countries and has over 110,000 employees worldwide.</p>

<p>Bruno Lavole is the Head of International Cash Management at BNP Paribas, the largest bank of the Eurozone by net income. He is responsible for corporate activities in Europe, Asia and the US, outside of the retail banking network. Bruno Lavole gained extensive international experience as the person responsible for major North American Corporate Coverage, as head of European loan syndication, and in Capital Markets activity.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="what-is-bnp-paribas-cash-management-strategy-in-europe">What is BNP Paribas’ Cash Management strategy in Europe?</h5>
<p>As a major European bank with a strong portfolio of products and close working relationships with major corporations, our strategy is to be one of the top cash management banks in Europe by providing global solutions for our clients. We develop global solutions for liquidity management and cash management according to the objectives and the needs of our corporate clients.</p>
<p>We offer a range of global services directly to clients in a large number of countries. We provide this principally in Europe, Asia and America, through our international network. In this respect, in the Retail Banking Area, our on-going purchase of Banca Nazionale del Lavaro will give us a strong footprint in a second major European Market.</p>
<p>In locations where we have no direct presence, we complement our existing network with our local partners’ alliances. We are therefore able to provide liquidity and cash pooling solutions, using selected partners to provide our clients with same day value sweeping of funds (ACCIS).</p>

</figure>
<h5 id="how-has-bnp-paribas-built-its-cash-management-business">How has BNP Paribas built its cash management business?</h5>
<p>Cash management is striking to me on two levels. Firstly, it is something that banks have always done. By definition, these services – payments, collections, facilitating liquidity management for clients – are at the core of the banking business. On the other hand, although it is one of the bank’s oldest activities, it is an activity that is very technologically demanding and rapidly evolving.</p>
<aside>
<h5 id="sepa">SEPA</h5>
<p>The European Commission intends to have a fully operational Single European Payments Area (SEPA) in place by 2010. The advent of SEPA will create a single market whereby all payments originating in and destined for any EU Member State will be processed at the same speed and at the same prices as domestic payments.</p>
</aside>
<p>As a bank that has traditionally been strong in this market – historically in France, but also progressively in other European countries – BNP Paribas has always offered cash management solutions and services. We have come from a point where cash management was a traditional service provided by banks to clients, to a point where this activity is positioned as very strategic to the bank.</p>
<p>Since January 2000, with the creation of our Cash Management Activity Line (LACM), we have a pro-active strategy with all of our product development being managed in Paris. A year ago, we decided to regroup our international cash management activities in the various countries where we are present under a single international business line. The main purpose of this restructuring was to move towards being a more pro-active solution provider.</p>
<h5 id="do-you-see-sepa-as-a-threat">Do you see SEPA as a threat?</h5>
<p>No, we don’t think that SEPA is a threat. SEPA obviously presents two challenges for banks. One of these is that payment operational models for corporations will change. There will be technological changes required, so banks will have to adapt to those, this will obviously entail some additional costs, which will be one of the challenges for us.</p>
<p>A second challenge is that by having one domestic area for payments instead of multiple domestic areas, there is a risk of going to a commodities model for some transactions, which could lead to lower prices.</p>
<p>However, if SEPA is a challenge, then like any change, it can be looked upon as an opportunity. Furthermore, like any other major change, we will all have to adapt and manage it. BNP Paribas is very involved in working diligently on these changes and we are also keeping our corporate clients closely involved. SEPA will facilitate treasury management for corporations, many of which are our clients. It will facilitate the way they operate and will provide global platforms in terms of operations, which will also be beneficial to large banks like ours, who have a multi-country presence in Europe.</p>
<p>SEPA is a great opportunity for major banks like BNP Paribas – and for our clients as well. Of course there will be an adaptation phase, but overall we see it as an opportunity to concentrate on value added liquidity services. These services will be offered at many steps along the service chain. SEPA will facilitate the standardisation of processes. In this new environment, by expanding our services in the SEPA zone, we shall be able to provide more efficient solutions to our clients. Another area of growing importance today is the quality of information which clients are expecting from banks. This is driven by regulatory and business requirements.</p>
<p>So I see more automation and better qualitative information as two of the major areas where we will see the development of value added services.</p>
<h5 id="how-does-your-cash-management-offering-differ-from-that-of-your-competitors">How does your cash management offering differ from that of your competitors?</h5>
<p>All major players have many points in common particularly in terms of products and capabilities. However our business philosophy is driven by our client’s needs and staying very close to those needs. This leads to two major areas of customer focus:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The first area is that everything we do starts from our clients’ needs. As they evolve, we want to adapt accordingly. So whenever we are working towards product and solution development, we endeavour to anticipate our clients’ requirements. We combine the need to have a global platform and products, with the ability to be very flexible. We adapt to our clients’ demands during the first commercial negotiation and continue to do so during the implementation of the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second area is to find the best balance for the client between a centralised solution approach and the client’s need to also have a local service in our various operations abroad.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So I would say that we do not necessarily focus on a specific area or product, but develop continuously in all areas to meet our client’s needs for global solutions. We do of course standardise the service platforms, but at the same time we also stay both global and local.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-see-your-cash-management-offering-developing-in-the-future">How do you see your cash management offering developing in the future?</h5>
<p>It’s a continuously evolving business. We have global offerings primarily in Europe, North America and in Asia. We have a strong presence in all these regions. Today, our first priority is in Europe – where BNP Paribas is expanding its domestic footprint through the Banca Nazionale del Lavaro acquisition. In the near future, we will be one of the very few banks with two very strong domestic bases. That is a major move.</p>
<p>We will also continue to invest, as we have done in the past, in products and services such as SWIFTNet. We have a multi-year investment plan to ensure that we continue to offer our clients the latest technology, best products and quality service that they expect. As we evolve, we will continue to be at the forefront, offering our clients what they need in a world where clients’ needs are also rapidly evolving.</p>
<h5 id="how-have-you-seen-your-clients-needs-develop-in-recent-years">How have you seen your clients’ needs develop in recent years?</h5>
<p>We are seeing one particular trend that is apparent. Solutions that were, in the past, only considered by major corporates, are now considered, reviewed and implemented by mid-caps and large mid-caps. We have to adapt accordingly. Mid-caps and large midcaps are now expecting the same quality of service that is being provided to major multinationals and we aim to provide this. This evolution is important for cash management banks. Banks like BNP Paribas, which have a strong strategy for this client segment, the capacity to follow up and deliver, and a global European and international presence, are very well positioned.</p>
<p>As far as we are concerned, we see more and more of these large mid-caps coming to us for services, and we see global European solutions sold and implemented with smaller clients which we would not have seen a few years ago. Our clients are expecting more standardisation, more automation and highest quality of service. It’s simply not enough to offer today’s clients strong platforms that are very efficient at processing, collections and payments. It is also essential to have very good service on the ground.</p>
<p>One of our points of differentiation which I mentioned is our client service philosophy, which we have in all the BNP Paribas areas. It’s not only about efficiency; it’s also about service. This means being close to the client and interfacing with the client to provide immediate after sale service and immediate contact. What we do is done in a personalised way – our cash customer service, which is a dedicated after sale service, clearly demonstrates our philosophy. This is not a call centre – it’s a platform where clients are followed specifically by dedicated bank representatives.</p></div>

<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Jon Theuerkauf</h4>
<h5 class="title">Head of Best Practice, Global Transaction Banking</h5>
<img alt="HSBC" class="logo org" height="18" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/hsbc-logo-2008-100x18.png" width="100"/>
</div>
<h5 id="does-six-sigma-have-any-relevance-to-the-treasury-function">Does Six Sigma have any relevance to the treasury function?</h5>
<p>Sure it does. I have been talking to major corporates about what is keeping them up at night. What issues are causing the nightmares. One recurring theme right now is SOX – Sarbanes- Oxley. This is a good example of where the tools of Six Sigma can help.</p>
<p>All the SOX auditors are really asking about is good process management. They are asking, do you understand the processes in your business? Do you have the key process indicators and key risk indicators (KRIs) identified? Do you measure and monitor them? Do you have reaction plans if an indicator gets outside acceptable tolerance? In other words do you have risk mitigation plans? For Six Sigma guys this is what we call business process and risk management. It is all about being in control and being able to demonstrate that you are.</p>
<p>Those companies that have a Six Sigma initiative in place have been able to say we do that already. GE is an example. Being great users of Six Sigma, they were able to say we already do that. Others have their own process improvement programs and are also not struggling with SOX. But many companies are. For these companies Six Sigma techniques can help.</p>
<p>Maybe it would help if I give you some practical suggestions – a process you can use for meeting SOX requirements (see box below).</p>
<h5 id="can-six-sigma-help-here">One of the other issues facing treasury is the impact of new accounting regulations. Can Six Sigma help here?</h5>
<p>Six Sigma helps whenever there is process. It may not help very much with the interpretation of accounting rules but, as soon as the rules are applied and there is a process in the equation, Six Sigma can help in analysing the impact and the risks so that the key risk areas are recognised. A tool called failure modes effect analysis can be used to determine what happens if a process blows up. This helps us to get a predictable outcome and once again have effective control.</p>
<h5 id="can-they-cherry-pick-six-sigma">Can a department in a company that does not have an extensive Six Sigma program use just some of the techniques? Can they ‘cherry-pick’ Six Sigma?</h5>
<p>There are some basic tools in the Six Sigma tool kit you can use without taking the whole process.</p>
<p>The first is a good mapping tool for the activities that you perform. The characteristics of good mapping, particularly for a SOX environment, is as you map it try to improve it.</p>
<p>You follow a simple methodology, identify:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Business enabling (or regulatory) activities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Mapping is done at the level of the activity or the process that does something, that turns one thing into another or changes something. We use colour codes when we are mapping. Green for value added work that changes an input to something else. Non-value add is red. This is usually re-work, waste, queuing time, any activity that does not add value and should be eliminated. The third part, the tricky part, is business enabling activity. If I do not do this activity, I can be fined or put out of business. An example in our business is all the documentation surrounding trading. It has no value add but it enables us to keep control. KYC (Know Your Customer) documentation is another good example. These boxes are yellow.</p>
<p>So the first step is to map out all the processes and code them. Then the second thing you want to do is simulations. If you are looking at optimisation work it is important to be able to simulate.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What will happen if I take all these red boxes out, all that rework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many people would I need then?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is really useful when you are doing Sarbanes-Oxley work because you can simulate and understand the effects of changes without being forced to experiment with an actual change in the processes. So you can simulate and thus understand what is the effect on the rest of the process if this or that goes wrong.</p>
<p>Six Sigma is like a Formula1 tool box with 500 tools inside it but this is one of the good basic tools.</p>

<h5 id="so-how-would-you-analyse-what-could-go-wrong">So how would you analyse what could go wrong?</h5>
<p>There are lots of ways to do this but one of the most pragmatic is what is called the failure mode effect analysis tool. This is a very good way to take subject matter experts and force them down a methodical, rigorous path using a map of the processes. The experts tell us what happens if that pops or if that process fails.</p>
<p>Then we can weigh the probability of the event – how likely is it that there will be a problem. So we get what does it cost and how likely is a blow up? Then you take the appropriate action. A £500,000 per event, once every five years risk would get a low risk rating in our business.</p>
<p>In a SOX situation this process enables you to identify, rank and rate the risks and establish the key indicators that you want to put in place. Then you feel comfortable you have not missed things.</p>
<h5 id="how-does-activity-based-costing-fit-in-this-process">How does activity based costing fit in this process?</h5>
<p>If you take the view that you want to improve the processes as you map them then activity based costing is very helpful. For example, how much cost is in all those red boxes? Nothing motivates management more than the cost of non-value add steps in a processes. How much of the actual processing cost is lost in non value-add processes?</p>
<p>An example in our business is a standard account opening form. Do we have exactly what is required or are we over-burdening the process? We turned an eight page form into a four page form. This was a golden nugget we found and every company has them. When you find them you can get enormous savings.</p>
<p>There is another great tool called QFD which you can use to understand the requirements of the business and translate them into operational definitions. It is the latter process that often gets missed. In a SOX environment QFD helps you develop a definition of what is really required. To define the ‘must have’ and not the ‘nice to have’, which have been put in place for a single event which is unlikely to recur.</p>

</blockquote>
<h5 id="it-sounds-as-if-it-is-a-large-piece-of-paper-and-coloured-pens">Tell me what form these tools take. It sounds as if it is a large piece of paper and coloured pens?</h5>
<p>No it has to be very much electronic. There are lots of software programs available.</p>
<p>You will use a paper based process to start and get the big boxes – 12 or 14 boxes within which we define the processes. We do this in what we call the war room. Then others review the maps the first guys have produced. Then subject matter experts review and everyone is bought in to make sure all the processes are properly defined.</p>
<p>Then this is put into the software which becomes the base for all the subsequent work. It becomes the engine room driving everything else we do. Value and non-value add are defined. Then activity based costing is applied to the processes. The electronic document becomes the reference point, the place we go back to. All the information, all the key risk indicators, all the failure nodes are identified. All the information is stored in the software which is generally available to everyone working on the project.</p>
<h5 id="how-does-a-company-choose-which-program-to-use">How does a company choose which program to use?</h5>
<p>Great question! If you have a group standard great, but there are lots of software programs otherwise and some tools can be downloaded free from the web. You might also want to send someone to get trained or purchase a self tutorial.</p>
<p>Leading names are iGrafix, Process Flow and ABC Flow Charter but there are lots of other programs. Only a select number of these programs have process simulators. With others you take the output and put it in another program like Crystal Ball.</p>
<p>Failure modes effect analysis is really just a big sheet. You can get Excel spreadsheets that do this off the web. The discipline is how to take a team through the process of identifying what can go wrong. These techniques all came from the military and NASA who had to work out worst case scenarios.</p>
<p>QFD tools can also be freeware from the web. QFD stands for Quality Functional Deployment. It has been around for a long time. Six Sigma pulled a lot of these tried and tested approaches together in a tool box. It gives the framework to say when you see this situation go to drawer 7 and use tool 38.</p>
<h5 id="what-if-the-event-is-very-unlikely-but-it-could-be-catastrophic">A lot of this process is about risk analysis and evaluating the likelihood of an event happening. What if the event is very unlikely but it could be catastrophic?</h5>
<p>You live with it and you may just accept it as a risk in the business and keep an eye on it. But if it is very unlikely it is not going to be one of the key risk indicators you monitor all the time.</p>
<p>You have to take a practical approach. You cannot reserve against every possible event. I believe statistics are a great tool for evaluating risk. If a risk is very unlikely to occur I will have a mitigation plan and will think carefully about whether to invest in reducing a one in a million risk.</p>
<p>This is all about getting a comfort level for the risks the business faces. You can do not enough or do too much and a lot of this is subjective. There is no one answer. It depends on the company’s appetite for risk. I may think that it is OK. You may think that my sampling is not adequate. That is where the subjectivity comes in and also where the auditors differ. That is why SOX is so difficult.</p>
<p>It is about comfort levels. Are the executives comfortable that they have in a very thorough, in a very practical way, using common sense, looked at the processes in the business? Have they mapped the processes, identified the risks and then fixed them or put mitigation plans in place? Are they comfortable? If so, they can sign knowing that if one of those events occur this will be what happens.</p>

<p>“These techniques all came from the military and NASA who had to work out worst case scenarios.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="please-tell-me-a-little-more-about-how-you-are-using-abc-in-hsbc">Can I come back to ABC? Costing within banking has always been an uncertain art. Please tell me a little more about how you are using ABC in HSBC.</h5>
<p>There is ABC and ABC Management – ABCM. This takes the P and L data and flows the costs back to the activities within the organisation.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example. If we take account opening we might want to look at different types of account and the processes involved in opening them. ABC is the process that enables the costs to be allocated based on the processes involved in opening different types of account. ABCM gives the manager a much better view of what it is really costing to open different types of account.</p>
<p>Everyone talks about marginal pricing which is fine but only when you understand break even. This is not well understood in the banking business.</p>
<h5 id="dont-you-need-to-set-prices-to-get-transactional-volume-in-the-banking-business">Don’t you need to set prices to get transactional volume in the banking business?</h5>
<p>Yes but you also need to know break even. You need to get the right information in front of people to get them to understand. Time Based ABC enables us to understand this, to understand break even.</p>
<p>We have a new mantra – good data combined with common sense and a practical view of the world and the business we operate will yield more frequent and better decisions. If you remove any of these three elements you have poorer business decisions.</p>
<h5 id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-them">Treasurers are increasingly reaching out in the organisation and trying to influence what is going on elsewhere. This is something you are doing all the time. What advice would you give to them?</h5>
<p>This is about change management. You have to create a shared need for change, felt by everyone. You need everyone pulling the same way – toward a common vision.</p>
<p>Once everyone is on side you are aligned and you can use the Six Sigma. This is what we need to do, this is what it will give us. How are we going to do it? Hey, here is a methodology to help us get there. And once we have improved it stays improved.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>This is the first in an occasional series of interviews with senior bankers. Every month we interview a corporate treasurer and we thought it was time that we talked to leading bankers and got their views.</p>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Andrew England</h4>
<h5 class="title">Global Head of Product Management Global Cash Management</h5>
<img alt="Deutsche Bank" class="logo org" height="18" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/deutsche-bank-logo-2011-120x18.png" width="120"/>
</div>
<p>In this interview we talk to Andrew England of Deutsche Bank. Deutsche adopted a strategy of becoming a global player in the payment and collection business several years ago and has been making substantial investments in the business. In this interview Andrew talks frankly about the dilemmas Deutsche Bank and others face as the European payments market slowly evolves under various political and economic pressures. He also talks about the new relationship between Deutsche Bank and Barclays.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-your-job">What is your job?</h5>
<p>I am head of the product group at Global Cash Management, a job that I took up when I joined Deutsche six years ago. It is a bit different now to how it was when I first joined. The product management discipline was, I think I can say, not one that was well understood by the bank’s cash management business. We have had to build up the understanding of the role</p>
<p>The latent cash management business has always been here. Deutsche has always had a strong payment capability and been very strong in the payments business. In Germany, for example, we were very strong in Deutsche Mark clearing. We decided it was time to manage cash management as a global business with all the relevant functions. Product management was one of these key functions. We were later than some of the US banks to see it as a business but not too late and we have been building our global cash management franchise over the last few years.</p>
<h5 id="is-it-too-late-for-anyone-else-to-enter-the-business">You say you were a little late. Is it too late for anyone else to enter the business?</h5>
<p>It is difficult to see anyone new entering the global market. It is just too big a commitment; the technology, the physical network and the people. It costs a lot of money, year on year. The banks that are in the business are known. You could say the fundamental players have emerged. But I would not be surprised to see new regional players emerging. There is still scope for banks in Europe to develop niche regional strategies.</p>
<h5 id="can-we-look-at-how-deutsche-has-built-its-global-cash-management-business">Can we look at how Deutsche has built its global cash management business?</h5>
<p>In Europe first of all, we built our European cross-border liquidity capability. This was one of my first tasks. We ensured firstly that our Deutsche Mark payment capability was protected and then that we emerged as a strong euro clearer. We wanted to be global and in the early days this meant focusing on Europe and Asia. But then the Bankers Trust acquisition gave us a footprint in the US and a strong dollar franchise. The next task was to make sure we had the right level of investment in Germany. We wanted to ensure our home market was being looked at and addressed properly. This platform is continuously being enhanced as the base for all our European business. By 2005 we will have completed a very substantial investment phase which has lasted five or six years.</p>
<h5 id="what-does-this-investment-mean-to-the-end-user">What does this investment mean to the end-user?</h5>
<p>Well let me start with the high value payment market. We have built a single platform for the dollar and euro clearing business. This is mainly, but not exclusively, a financial institutions (FI) market. They want similar capabilities regardless whether it is dollars or euros; the same level of automation, the same level of information services, the same investigation capabilities, the same billing and charging mechanisms for all their payments. We can deliver that in the US and near-term in Europe. The platform enables us to standardise our services. There are lots of small pieces of functionality that have to be built around all the processes. All these components add up and mean that we can now deliver client interactivity that is standardised.</p>
<p>For corporates it is much the same, although corporates tend to buy regionally. They are not as global as banks at the moment. But when they become more global and buy in both regions they will behave the same way as FIs. They will find we can offer a simple solution where they need it. A simple capability that is actually very difficult to deliver. But it is not just built around the clients needs. This is also about internal efficiencies. It is about restructuring the business from a cost perspective. How we can be more efficient. Then we can accompany the trend in downward pricing. It is not something we are looking for but if we cannot restructure our cost base we will not be able to deliver to the client at the cost they expect.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-your-attitude-to-sepa">What is your attitude to SEPA?</h5>
<p>(SEPA, the Single European Payment Area is an EU initiative to create a single domestic market for payments across the eurozone).</p>
<p>My attitude to SEPA is mixed. You cannot argue against the vision of turning Europe into a domestic payment environment. You cannot get away from that as an end objective. But, from the product point of view there are difficulties. It does not help me with the decisions I have to make today. We have to look at the bulk payment infrastructure in Western Europe as it is today. Currently we have bulk payment systems in many countries where we are physically on the ground. Each one of these systems is driven by the country dynamic and reflects the country formats. These systems are often supported by country vendors, local technology companies. The changes that occur are driven at a country level.</p>
<p>So how can one manage Western Europe efficiently as a supplier of services today? We are still faced with regulatory changes in certain countries where I have to commit more money at technology. In some cases technology vendors may be decommissioning software and we have to look at new software and systems. We are obliged to look at new investment in existing bulk payment systems just to stay in the business.</p>
<p>I would like to see a clearer and much faster move to a new payment environment at a European level so I can see what we need to do. It is not happening fast enough. Meanwhile we have to continue squeezing in-country investment out of a global budget which is meant to be used for enhancing regional platforms. It is not the ideal decision but the options are limited.</p>
<h5 id="and-there-are-legislative-pressures-on-pricing">And there are legislative pressures on pricing?</h5>
<p>Yes, there is a prescribed framework over what you can charge. But these legislative pressures do nothing to drive the development of a common payment infrastructure so we can deliver those services at a lower cost. We find ourselves sitting in between. It is almost as if the legislators are forcing cross-subsidisation, using one part of the business to support another. I don’t think that is healthy. It’s a dilemma for banks.</p>
<p>We need to push for faster execution of SEPA. But it is not just about infrastructure, it is also about legislation at a country level. You need to change the local rules that get in the way. For example a local law might oblige companies to hold accounts locally to collect money. But companies want to concentrate and consolidate their accounts. If the local legislation says you must have an account to be able to operate a direct debit, what do you do? You need to change the legislative framework surrounding the business as well.</p>
<h5 id="do-all-banks-feel-like-you-do">Do all banks feel like you do?</h5>
<p>Most banks recognise that lower infrastructure costs would benefit them. Meanwhile, you are faced with the reality of the cost of supporting local clearing system enhancements. You need to take the cost down and most banks understand this.</p>
<h5 id="in-particular-you-have-announced-a-rather-special-arrangement-with-barclays-how-is-this-going-to-work">If you cannot be in the business yourself you need to find a way to do it. For example, you are quite open about the fact that in a few countries Deutsche uses partner banks. But in many countries you are the partner banks to other banks. In particular, you have announced a rather special arrangement with Barclays. How is this going to work?</h5>
<p>This is a new type of relationship which we are seeing develop. The way we look at it is that a bank has to decide when it wants to go to another provider rather than make the investment directly.</p>
<p>We have negotiated with Barclays a structure that positions us as a provider of European services for their corporate customers who will be accessing our network in Western Europe. Their customers will open accounts with Deutsche Bank and make payments and collections. But it will be seamlessly integrated at the front end alongside their existing accounts with Barclays.</p>
<p>From our perspective what we want are the transactions. We want the volume as part of our business model. We see the need to attract and process volumes as a key competency. It enables us to generate transaction volume from a new marketplace without having to make some of the commitments we would have to have made if we had tried to go in directly. Customer documentation and credit remains with Barclays.</p>
<p>It is a win-win for both banks. For Barclays it is not about taking out cost but offering a service they did not have before. The customer still has a legal relationship with Barclays and any liquidity on the accounts is passed back to Barclays.</p>
<p>Other institutions will be following this model as significant interest has resulted from the deal and a number of serious discussions are underway. It is a structure that more and more banks will have to follow if they are going to provide cost-effective services to their clients.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-the-latest-trends-in-the-business">What are the latest trends in the business?</h5>
<p>We are seeing more and more interest in MA-CUGs. The typical client is a major multinational with big payment volumes. What we call bank independent clients, the very top end. They are joining several MA-CUGs as they need to join one for each major bank that they use.</p>
<p>Otherwise there is more emphasis from clients around how they want to manage their cash. This is not new but we do see more corporates looking at their liquidity globally, particularly dollar liquidity.</p>
<h5 id="tell-me-in-30-seconds-why-a-company-should-come-to-deutsche-bank">Tell me in 30 seconds why a company should come to Deutsche Bank</h5>
<p>For their payment and collection business if they are looking for a global provider we are certainly one of the very best providers out there in terms of: the instrument coverage we have, the geographical coverage and the business model that we have in terms of being able to support them locally. Our platform is globally engineered and has robustness and scale. In terms of customer satisfaction we are consistently rated very highly. Our ability to automate and link to other systems and cope with the complexity of formats has been proven time and time again. We have covered from an investment point of view all major areas of our IT and Operations infrastructure. A corporate will find we are a very strong partner with very few gaps.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Founded as the Dutch state mining company in 1902, DSM is now focussing on its specialty chemicals business, selling its petrochemicals division last year. The company’s objective is to achieve a turnover of €10 billion by 2005.</p>
<div class="people right company">
<div class="vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Adrian van Sleeuwen</h4>
<h5 class="title">Director Corporate Treasury</h5>
<img alt="DSM" class="logo org" height="37" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/dsm-logo-2013-120x37.png" width="120"/>
</div>
<p>DSM is a leading producer of life science products, performance materials and industrial chemicals. Headquartered in The Netherlands, the group employs about 20,000 people in 200 offices and production sites in 40 countries around the world. It turns over about €6 billion annually.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="how-is-the-dsm-treasury-organised">How is the DSM Treasury organised?</h5>
<p>The first thing to say is that corporate treasury in DSM is highly centralised. This means that at the local level there is no treasury function at all. All funding both external and internal, cash management and risk management for the group is performed by the corporate treasury.</p>
<p>Corporate treasury is part of the corporate finance and economics department, which also includes the corporate control and accounting, fiscal affairs and insurance.</p>
<p>The corporate treasury is staffed by fifteen people. The treasury is split into three departments:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Corporate finance.</h5>
<p>The team of three acts as a front office for the treasury, arranging all the internal and external funding for the group. They are also responsible for portfolio risk management, essentially interest rate risk management. Finally they perform a more traditional corporate finance role, providing advice on financial policies and M&amp;A and other strategic projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Cash management.</h5>
<p>This team of three – a cash manager and two dealers – is responsible for managing all the liquidity within the group. They also manage the group’s foreign exchange risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Back office.</h5>
<p>This includes a controller who is responsible for all the management reporting and accounting. The other members of the team perform all the regular operational accounting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although we run a number of different technology systems and platforms, we only get staff to manage them on a project by project basis. All the rest of the technology management is outsourced either to the corporate IT department or to external suppliers.</p>
<h5 id="how-is-treasury-held-accountable">How is treasury held accountable?</h5>
<p>I report to the director of Corporate Finance and Economics every two weeks, although I will consult him in the meantime if necessary. We also report formally on a monthly and quarterly basis. The five members of DSM’s Managing Board all have oversight responsibilities within the group. A sub-committee of the CEO and the CFO is responsible for overseeing the work of the corporate finance and economics department, including treasury.</p>
<p>Treasury is set a target for net financial income over the year. We also have a target for net debt. Finally, we have to manage interest rate, foreign exchange and credit risks within certain levels. In addition, treasury is also set both a cost budget and an investment budget.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-manage-the-cash-across-the-various-entities-within-the-group">How do you manage the cash across the various entities within the group?</h5>
<p>The most important thing is the structure, what we call the financial logistics. We run ten cash pools across the group. We have a US Dollar pool, a Sterling pool and several local euro pools in the various Western European countries. Most of these pools are zero-balancing, although, for historical reasons, there is also a notional pool that operates alongside these zero-balancing pools in the Netherlands. The other main factor in the cash management structure is our in-house bank. Almost all our subsidiaries keep accounts with the in-house bank. This structure enables us to manage about 90% of the group’s global liquidity, which we do very closely.</p>
<p>The other 10% is not controlled directly by the central treasury, but rather by our subsidiaries in-country. These subsidiaries are located in countries, typically in South America and Asia, where there are significant barriers to have accounts at the inhouse bank.</p>
<h5 id="are-all-your-cash-pools-operated-by-the-same-bank">Are all your cash pools operated by the same bank?</h5>
<p>We have a banking policy which is based on relationship banking. We work with a core group of five banks that can provide us with the full range of banking services on a global basis. This includes capital markets, money markets and investment banking business as well as the cash management services.</p>
<p>In addition to these five, we use some domestic cash management banks to operate cash pools for us in certain countries. However the most important cash management bank for us in the Netherlands and the USA is ABN AMRO.</p>
<h5 id="do-you-determine-which-bank-the-local-subsidiaries-use">Do you determine which bank the local subsidiaries use?</h5>
<p>Yes. We specify that the subsidiaries should concentrate with only one bank and that they must hold an account with one of the cash management or core banks. We do, of course, provide the subsidiaries with advice and support on managing their bank relationships.</p>
<h5 id="what-do-you-do-with-any-surpluses-in-the-cash-pools">What do you do with any surpluses in the cash pools?</h5>
<p>Our objective is to manage these pools to a zero balance target, so usually there is not a significant surplus. When we do have a surplus in the short-term, we will place it on deposit.</p>
<p>However, we are in an unusual situation at the moment. We have just realised €3 billion from the sale of our petrochemicals and natural gas businesses, which we have reinvested on a temporary basis. Part has been invested in commercial paper, part placed on deposit, with the majority invested in a taxefficient structure.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-arrange-your-funding">How do you arrange your funding?</h5>
<p>At the moment, there is no real need to access external funding as a result of the divestment. However in a normal situation, we would seek to raise long-term finance from bond issues, with short-term financing coming from the issue of commercial paper.</p>
<p>In the past, we issued bonds, mainly euro- and US Dollar-denominated. At present, we do not expect any refunding issues when the first bond comes up for redemption in 2004. Others come up for redemption in 2005 and 2006.</p>
<p>On the commercial paper side, we have both a €900m Euro CP programme and a $400m USCP programme. We recently increased the Euro CP programme from €500m. This was because we had found it difficult to fund ourselves cost-effectively using the USCP programme. As a result, the USCP is barely used at the moment, whilst the Euro CP programme has about €500m outstanding.</p>
<p>Internally, with a few exceptions, all the business units are funded centrally. The exceptions are, for example, our joint ventures in China and in South America. Those group companies that are funded centrally use the corporate financing company, DSM Finance BV, which provides long-term loans and short-term loans (up to twelve months). This is done with the close co-operation of our fiscal team, who provide the help needed to keep up-to-date with, for example, thin capitalisation rules. More generally, we have to be alert to any changes in the rules, such as the recent ones in the USA, so that we can react in an appropriate manner.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-manage-foreign-exchange-risk">How do you manage foreign exchange risk?</h5>
<p>The first thing we do is distinguish between translation, transaction and economic risk.</p>
<p>Economic risk is not managed by the treasury. We argue that we are not in a position to do so. It is therefore for the business units to manage, which they do by seeking a balance in the structure of their operations and facilities with the pattern of their sales.</p>
<p>The management of transaction risk is also primarily the responsibility of the business units. They are required to keep track of their position. We provide the business units with advice on how to get control of the positions and then how and how often to hedge them. The business units are not allowed to hedge with external banks; rather they hedge their positions with us in the corporate treasury. The business units will hedge their positions via the group’s internal electronic banking system.</p>
<p>The two dealers in the cash management department then hedge the net position with the external banks. At the moment, about 70% of our trades are transacted through the electronic trading platform, Currenex. Our goal is to trade all of our foreign exchange through Currenex by the end of the year. At the moment two of our six foreign exchange banks are not on Currenex. We have told these two that, if they are not on Currenex by the end of the year, we will cease to use them. We chose Currenex originally because it was the first available platform. Although initially we signed up for a six-month pilot with the intention of trying an alternative platform, at the end of the pilot period the alternative had gone out of business. Because we were perfectly happy with Currenex at that stage, we continued to use it.</p>
<p>In the past, it was our policy not to hedge translation risk. However after we made a major acquisition in the US in 2000 (the purchase of Catalytica Pharmaceuticals), our balance sheet’s exposure to the dollar was very high. We decided to hedge 50% of the translation risk. Initially this position was hedged using our USCP programme. However it is not easy hedging a long-term translation risk with a short-term instrument such as CP. As a result, we now hedge translation risk with long-term dollar funding.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-manage-interest-rate-risk">How do you manage interest rate risk?</h5>
<p>Two years ago, we conducted a study to find out whether there was a correlation between our operating results and the interest rate. This study found that the correlation between the two was quite high. As a result, we decided that a maximum of our net debt should be funded at a floating rate. In practice, this means that the proportion of our net debt that is subject to a floating rate varies between 40% and 60%. Within this 20% band, we try to ride the yield curve and to pick the optimal moments to switch fixed debt to floating and vice versa. We find that this system works well for us.</p>
<h5 id="what-instruments-do-you-use-to-manage-interest-rate-risk">What instruments do you use to manage interest rate risk?</h5>
<p>Selecting the correct instruments to use is the real challenge. We mainly use interest rate swaps. However within the 20% band, if we decide we need to fix the rate of some additional debt, we have to decide whether to fix existing euroor dollar-denominated floating debt. This is quite difficult. There is no formula that we can use to help us. As a result, this decision is mainly based on our view of the markets.</p>
<p>We then compare our results to three different benchmarks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A theoretical portfolio, where 100% of the debt was fixed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A theoretical portfolio, where 100% of the debt was floating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third benchmark is the most important. This is again a theoretical portfolio, but one where the split between fixed and floating rate debt is 50/50. We try to get as close to this measure as possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="your-other-major-exposure-is-to-credit-risk-how-do-you-manage-that">Your other major exposure is to credit risk. How do you manage that?</h5>
<p>This is fairly straightforward. We have limits in terms of both the amount of business that we put with any one bank and also the individual instruments, for example deposits and derivatives. All our counterparty banks must have a minimum rating of A1.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-use-technology-within-dsm-treasury">How do you use technology within DSM Treasury?</h5>
<p>Technology is developing very fast. For the last two years, DSM has had an internal global communications network. Every employee within DSM has a workstation that has access to that network and uses standardised software. This intranet makes communication within the group very easy.</p>
<p>Treasury is more complicated. We had a patchwork of about ten different systems and applications. Two years ago, we decided to restructure treasury’s use of technology and to focus on SAP applications (which are being used in the rest of the group) as much as possible. We started by implementing SAP’s Corporate Finance Management system to replace the older treasury management and risk management systems.</p>
<p>We are now in the process of replacing our current internal electronic banking system, which links the treasury to the subsidiaries, with one based on the SAP system. This will make things easier for us as the new internal electronic banking system will connect to the ERP systems in the business units, which are mainly also SAP systems.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-your-next-challenges">What are your next challenges?</h5>
<p>Once we have implemented the SAP internal electronic banking system, we will establish a payments factory, using the SAP platform. At the moment, all the subsidiaries are responsible for making their own payments and thus all have their own links to their banks. Once we have a payments factory, the subsidiaries will only link to the payments factory, allowing us to be more efficient in the way we manage our cash.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, by the end of this year we want to have all foreign exchange transactions routed through Currenex. After that we will be looking to perform our money market transactions over a similar platform. The main advantage of these types of platform is that they interface directly with our back office, providing for straight-through processing which reduces manual input costs and the chance of errors. DSM is committed to the TWIST standards and we are now cooperating in the working group that is developing standards for commercial payments. We see the development of industry standards as an investment in the future; there will be shortterm costs but the realisation of straight-through processing will create real long-term benefits.</p>
<p>Our other challenge is to integrate the Roche Vitamins and Fine Chemicals business which we will acquire this year. This will also be a major undertaking as this will add about €2.5 billion of sales and an organisation of more than 60 companies operating in about 40 countries to DSM.</p></div>

<p>Based in France, Alcatel is a global leader in the provision of telecom equipment. It designs, develops and builds global communications networks and solutions that are sold around the world. In 2001, Alcatel was active in 130 countries, employing 99,000 people and generating sales worth €25.3 billion. Globally, it is the leading provider of broadband access and optical networking equipment. Its main market is Europe, which contributes 51% of sales; its other significant markets are the USA (19%) and Asia (13%).</p>
<p>As a company, it is organised into four main divisions: Carrier networking (fixed-line and mobile networking products, sold to telecom carriers) – 45% of the group’s sales; Optics (including optical fibres and lasers) – 29%; e-business (includes technology for developing local area networks) – 14%; Space and components (satellite technology and Alcatel’s battery subsidiary) – 12%.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="how-is-the-alcatel-treasury-function-structured">How is the Alcatel treasury function structured?</h5>
<p>Treasury within Alcatel is highly centralised. Risk management – foreign exchange, interest rate, financing and bank relationships – is fully centralised worldwide. The main operating units, those in Europe and North America, can only transact with one counterparty, Alcatel Central Treasury, for cash, debt and foreign exchange. They are not allowed to deal with external banks.</p>
<p>For tax and regulatory reasons, the operating units in some countries cannot transact in this way with Central Treasury. For these countries, Central Treasury takes the risk management decisions, which are then implemented locally.</p>
<p>This level of concentration in Central Treasury is consistent with the Alcatel culture as other functions – such as tax, equity and project finance – are highly centralised too. Alcatel changed fundamentally after the appointment of Serge Tchuruk as Chairman and CEO in 1995. Until then, Alcatel had been very decentralised, with the centre acting as a holding company. Since 1995, decision-making has been concentrated at the centre. The development of Central Treasury was part of this process and took eight months in 1995-96.</p>
<h5 id="how-is-central-treasury-structured">How is Central Treasury structured?</h5>
<p>There are three departments here within Central Treasury.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>International treasury</h5>
<p>– provides advice to all the 130 subsidiaries around the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Dealing room.</h5>
<p>We have seven members of staff who are fully dedicated to transacting in the financial markets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Risk control.</h5>
<p>This department reports to me, but is fully independent of the two other departments. It is responsible for developing benchmarking concepts and for controlling systems. In addition, this department runs our treasury reporting system. This is also highly centralised, as no other department is allowed to issue its own report.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These three departments, including my assistant and myself, employ twenty-one people. In addition, we have a back office team of eight and a dedicated Information Systems team of six; these are both located in Central Treasury in Paris.</p>
<p>Outside Central Treasury, but reporting directly to me, there are a further fifteen to twenty key treasury people. In the main operating countries in Europe and North America, we have an incountry treasury professional; in the other areas, there are treasurers with a regional responsibility. Finally, within the operating units, there are also treasuries that are important in their own organisations.</p>
<p>So within the treasury network, there are about sixty people. We are in contact with all of them on a regular basis. I have to ensure that they are deployed in the best way for the company. We also provide them with training to enhance their career development within treasury. We also hold a treasury convention once a year for the whole treasury network.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-the-risks-that-you-face-and-how-do-you-manage-them">What are the risks that you face and how do you manage them?</h5>
<p>The first risk is foreign exchange risk, which is very complex. The risks arise from bids that our operating units make for contracts, usually in US Dollars. The contingent risk is very difficult to manage – the company is at risk, having put in a bid, however the operating unit will not know for six to twelve months whether it has won the contract.</p>
<p>Until we centralised treasury, the approach to this risk was different from business unit to business unit. Some units used currency options; some argued that because they didn’t understand the risk, then they would do nothing to manage it; and others took a budgetary approach and tried to manage a proportion of the risk.</p>
<p>As a result, we have developed a global solution for Alcatel. Every time a business unit bids for a contract, it comes to Central Treasury with its foreign exchange requirement. We will give them a guaranteed fixed price, which then eliminates the currency risk for the business unit and transfers it to us. If the business unit loses the contract, this guarantee is simply not taken up. If it does win the contract, the business unit will then come back to us and we will provide them with the currency at the guaranteed rate.</p>
<p>Our responsibility is to optimise the foreign exchange position across Alcatel. We are subject to limits that are set by the treasury committee and we monitor our position daily to ensure that we stay compliant with these rules.</p>
<p>Secondly, on debt and liquidity management, we have a global approach to finance such that all bond issues and commercial paper programmes are in the name of the parent company. Central Treasury finances the subsidiaries directly, which means that our subsidiaries in Europe and North America don’t go directly to the market.</p>
<p>The business units are not allowed to manage interest rate risk. Central Treasury manages interest rate risk on a per currency and a per yield curve basis. This management is benchmarked and Central Treasury is obliged to manage interest rate risk within the limits set down by the treasury committee.</p>
<p>Finally, our objective is to optimise our relationships with the banks. We want to leverage the Alcatel position with respect to Central Treasury. We have a group of core banks to Alcatel, which we use both to help finance the company and also to finance our customers. Our customers sometimes ask for financing. We want to avoid keeping that financing on our balance sheet, so we help them to structure their financing and we have a dedicated project finance team which is responsible for managing that and the relationships with banks.</p>
<p>On the Corporate level, Central Treasury will then allocate bank lines within the group. We use a mixture of our core global banks and local niche players. It means that our approach is coordinated and also that the local units do not have to find financing on their own. The key point is that it optimises and leverages our bank relationships.</p>
<p>We need banks that can help us on a range of issues. In our core group we want banks with a good network that can demonstrate a strong willingness to support Alcatel.</p>
<h5 id="how-are-you-held-accountable">How are you held accountable?</h5>
<p>I have a formal meeting with the CFO at least once a week. In addition, the treasury committee (the General Manager, the CFO and I) meets every two weeks to discuss treasury and financing together.</p>
<p>In terms of reports, we produce a strong and detailed set of reports every two weeks. This is possible because treasury is centralised in Alcatel. We also have strong relationships with top management, who are very interested in financing and treasury. I am lucky as I have bosses who are interested in treasury, who challenge me and also brainstorm with me.</p>
<h5 id="what-role-have-you-played-in-managing-this-from-alcatels-perspective">There have been some high profile difficulties in your industry. What role have you played in managing this from Alcatel’s perspective?</h5>
<p>We have been very careful over the last year to send the message to the market that Alcatel has no liquidity crisis. We have managed this in three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Last summer, we realised that a crisis was emerging in the telecoms sector. We understood that the market would be cautious about debt and our ability to pay back that debt. We had a strong commercial paper programme, which although it has been very efficient, would become a weak point if it couldn’t be renewed. As a result, at the beginning of September we arranged a €1.2 billion club deal with four banks. The objective was not to use it, but that if we had a problem we could borrow from these four banks. This deal was available for one year from when we signed the deal (in October) and until we issued a bond. The key message was that Alcatel would not face a liquidity crisis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the end of November and although it wasn’t obvious, we realised from talking to our banks that we had a slight window in which to issue a bond. We planned to issue a €500m, five-year bond. It was oversubscribed so we actually issued €1.2 billion. As a result, the club deal was immediately stopped because it was unnecessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The last step was finalised at the beginning of April this year. We have bonds maturing in 2003, 2004 and 2005 at the rate of €1 billion a year. Again, to reassure the market that Alcatel was looking to the longer term, we arranged a syndication of €2.075 billion in two tranches. The first is a one-year rollover, worth about one third of the syndication, and the other tranch is three years. Our objective is again not to have to use it, but it is available for us should we need it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall our message to the market has been that we anticipate the future and we finance when we can. We don’t wait until the last minute, when problems might occur. When some telecom players are having difficulties, it is very important for us to make it clear to the market and to the ratings agencies that we have no problems with cash. In fact, we have around €5 billion in cash at the moment.</p>
<h5 id="what-do-you-do-with-this-cash">What do you do with this cash?</h5>
<p>The key for me is liquidity. I keep it very short-term, in instruments up to six months such as commercial paper and bons du Trésor. In addition some is in the cash pooling system. I will not buy ten-year bonds. Our objective at the moment is to demonstrate that we don’t have a problem with liquidity, rather than trying to earn an extra ten basis points.</p>
<h5 id="you-mentioned-a-cash-pooling-system-how-does-that-work">You mentioned a cash pooling system. How does that work?</h5>
<p>We operate an international cash pooling system for our thirteen core currencies. All international cash is sent through to Central Treasury using zero-balancing accounts run by ABN Amro and Société Générale. For the main currencies (Euro, US Dollar, Sterling), this means that there is no cash held at the subsidiary level.</p>
<h5 id="what-role-does-central-treasury-play-in-managing-working-capital">I notice from your annual report that your company is putting a lot of emphasis on working capital management. What role does Central Treasury play in managing working capital?</h5>
<p>Each international treasury (IT) analyst, the IT Director and I probably spent more than 50% of our time last year looking at working capital and debt. In January 2001, we implemented a Unit Financing Committee, chaired by the CFO. This meets on a monthly basis and brings together people from the group, tax, financial control and Central Treasury. The committee looks at each of about 40 of the major business units and sets debt limits and quarterly targets to reduce that debt. This is followed up every month. Four times a year, we hold an asset focus meeting, with the area controllers and the main units CFOs, at which we look at the detail of the balance sheet of the units (for example, at inventory, at the number of overdues, at the receivables and at whether the capital expenditure is in line with the business unit as a whole) and we seek a full explanation of this detail.</p>
<p>Our objective here is to reduce the level of capital employed. Whilst it can be very painful, it is also very efficient. To indicate the success so far – at the end of July 2001, we had €5.7 billion of debt, which had reduced to €2.7 billion by the end of December 2001. Part of the reason for this was a result of the sale of some assets. However, the main part resulted from a reduction in working capital.</p>
<p>I am sure that we will continue to hold both the monthly committee meetings and the quarterly asset focus meetings. This will allow us to keep capital employed under control. The key thing is to remind the Alcatel staff of the importance of cash as sometimes the business units can become too focussed on operating profits – “cash is king”.</p>
<p>Central Treasury has been part of this process and this achievement. We have put a lot of pressure within the organisation to achieve this reduction in working capital and debt. We delivered in 2001 and we are on track to deliver in 2002.</p>
<p>It is a good discipline. When a business unit wants to exceed its targets, both the CEO and the CFO of that business has to sign a document requesting that. This document is assessed by the Unit Financing Committee and checked by Central Treasury. This double control makes the business units think very carefully before submitting a request.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-use-technology">How do you use technology?</h5>
<p>Firstly, we use a dedicated risk management system called Murex. We have developed a very strong risk management strategy, but in order to do so we need to have the tools to put it into action. Murex is essentially a bank front office system. It is a strong tool for pricing, risk matrix, stress scenarios… Due to the range of products and the size of the portfolios, we need something that will give an integrated platform on which we can manage the interest rate and foreign exchange risks.</p>
<p>Secondly, our treasury management system is Cashflow (which was Diagram, but is now owned by Reuters), which runs our back office, cash management and payments. The bigger business units within Alcatel also have a light version of Cashflow. However we need to revisit this. At the moment, we are harmonising our ERP system throughout the group – we have SAP almost everywhere. We want to try to link the treasury management system to the ERP system.</p>
<p>We also have a treasury intranet, which we use to communicate with our subsidiaries. This is the means of reporting the ZBA cash flows, the foreign exchange and borrowing transactions. In addition, treasury is part of the whole Alcatel reporting system because I didn’t want to have a separate treasury reporting system. This is a database system which runs Carat and which is interrogated using Essbase.</p>
<p>The next step is to introduce an e-dealing system. At the moment, this is still very much a manual process. I want a straight-though link between the subsidiaries to the banks, through Central Treasury.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>In our regular interview with senior figures in the world of treasury and finance, this month talking to Nigel Brown, Arcadia Group.</p>
<div class="people right company">
<div class="vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Nigel Brown</h4>
<h5 class="title">Group Treasurer</h5>
<img alt="Arcadia logo" class="logo org" height="18" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/arcadia-logo-2002-90x18.png" title="Arcadia" width="90"/>
</div>
<p>Arcadia Group is the number two retailer on the UK High Street in terms of clothing and footwear. Having made an £8m loss in the year to August 2000, Arcadia made a profit of £53m on a turnover of £1.9 billion in the year to August 2001. Over 95% of the group’s trading activity is in the UK, with a small business in the Republic of Ireland and franchises in Europe, the Middle East and the Far East.</p>
<p>At the end of August 2001, the group had 2350 outlets, of which 1800 were standalone stores and 550 were ‘stores within stores’. In the UK, its activities are concentrated in six brands – Burton, Dorothy Perkins, Evans, Miss Selfridge, Topshop/ Topman and Wallis.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="how-is-the-arcadia-treasury-structured">How is the Arcadia treasury structured?</h5>
<p>Arcadia uses a broader definition of treasury than is traditional. I am the group treasurer, but I am also responsible for corporation tax, VAT and insurance.</p>
<p>On the treasury side, we are a small team, despite the fact that the company is quite large. This is for two reasons. Firstly, we have a lot of repetitive transactions and, secondly, the overwhelming majority of our activity (over 95%) is UK-based. In terms of personnel, I have a treasury manager, who is my number two, a dealing manager and a treasury assistant.</p>
<p>Like most corporate treasuries, we operate purely as a cost centre, not a profit centre. Our activities on foreign exchange, for example, are not speculative, they are simply to provide some certainty and predictability to the costs incurred by the brands when they purchase abroad.</p>
<h5 id="as-treasurer-how-are-you-held-accountable">As treasurer, how are you held accountable?</h5>
<p>Again, Arcadia is slightly unusual in this respect. I report to the Group Financial Controller, who reports to the Finance Director. We all also report to the treasury committee, which is a formally constituted committee of the main board. Its purpose is to oversee our workings, to make sure that we comply with our stated policies and controls. For example, I am required to hedge foreign exchange according to certain formulae and not to speculate. I report to the treasury committee on how I have done this in the last quarter.</p>
<p>The treasury committee has also to sanction any changes to debt. This means that we have to consult them when we refinance or when we seek to place deposits with new financial institutions. The committee is a control mechanism; it is not there to question our commercial judgement, per se.</p>
<h5 id="how-does-this-structure-affect-the-way-that-you-work">How does this structure affect the way that you work?</h5>
<p>It means that we work closer together with the finance team than a traditional structure would allow. The benefits of this structure were highlighted when we worked on our recovery plan, the need for which arose after a trading difficulty in December 1999. In the lead up to Christmas 1999, overstocking, a shift in consumer spending patterns and price deflation combined to put us into a loss situation. In such circumstances, cash is king and banks understandably become nervous. Although we never had a problem with cashflow and didn’t breach any banking covenants, we kept our banks fully informed.</p>
<p>Since that time, we have become a very much more cash-focussed business. We are a lot more skilful in cash forecasting and a lot more commercial on cash management, particularly in terms of supplier management and stock control. This focus on cash has raised the profile of treasury and finance within the group and has raised the relative importance of what we are doing.</p>
<p>As part of the recovery process, we looked through the whole working capital cycle and tried to identify where we could make cash work more effectively. This meant looking at some of the practices, procedures and systems that we were operating and asking why we operated that way. For example, we used to be very generous with our credit terms. We used to pay our trade suppliers in ten days; we are now on more standard terms and trade suppliers are paid in 28-30 days as are our foreign suppliers.</p>
<p>On stock control, previously we held greater levels of stock than now in order to fully potentialise sales; now we hold lower levels of stock, thereby reducing exposure to fluctuations in consumer demand. As a result, the group is in a good defensive position because we are not over exposed on stock and debt levels are much lower.</p>
<p>We now have, in effect, what amounts to a standing committee on cash management, both in terms of taking initiatives forward and for reporting on week-by-week cash movements. One advantage we have as a retailer is that the quantity and quality of information is exceptionally good, because of the way electronic systems provide us with up to date figures, daily sales figures the day after for example. This committee’s role is to try to spot opportunities to manage cash more efficiently; treasury and finance help by asking pertinent questions of other parts of the business.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-collect-cash-and-cheques-from-your-stores">How do you collect cash and cheques from your stores?</h5>
<p>Where we operate concessions within other stores, those stores (for example, Debenhams) cash collect for us. We organise cash and cheque collection for our standalone stores ourselves. Security carriers collect cash and cheques from each store and take them to the banks’ cash centres. Processing costs there are much lower than those at bank branches. We had considered whether to send cash to one bank and cheques to another. When we put out tenders for this business, we found a difference in the rates that we were quoted for cash and for cheques. However any cost saving is outweighed by both the procedural problems that it would cause in-store (managers would have to separate cash and cheques) and the cost of the additional security pickups.</p>
<p>The overall equation thus drives us to put cash and cheques together, to use security carriers, who are efficient and reliable, and to use the banks’ principal cash processing centres.</p>
<h5 id="can-you-describe-what-you-did">You mentioned a tendering process. Can you describe what you did?</h5>
<p>We held a tender both for our cash and cheques business and for our external credit cards business last year. About 30% of our receipts are cash and cheques and about 40% are external credit and debit cards. The rest are store cards. In both cases, our only rule on the tender was that if any bank wanted this ancillary business, it had to be in a debt relationship with us. As long as a bank is in a debt relationship with us, we then look for the best quote and the best quality service that meets our threshold criteria.</p>
<p>It is interesting though that for what is largely a commodity product provided by all the clearers, there are some banks that try that much harder than others. This time round HSBC not only provided the answer to the tender, they also looked at other issues and made suggestions. They have upgraded our electronic banking system and are now helping us with European pooling of our cash, something that we have not been able to do before. All the banks met the quality threshold and were quite keen on price. The bank that makes a little more effort, as HSBC did, stands out.</p>
<h5 id="how-many-banks-did-you-ask-to-tender">How many banks did you ask to tender?</h5>
<p>We asked five banks to tender for the cash business. One of the principal reasons for conducting the tendering process was to cut down the number of banks with whom we have a relationship. It’s more efficient to manage a smaller number of big banking relationships. For example, it makes it more efficient for our back of house people in Leeds to do the daily reconciliation. Secondly we now have three different electronic banking systems. This is part of simplifying our business, which is now our focus.</p>
<h5 id="how-long-did-the-process-take">How long did the process take?</h5>
<p>We started in August, the banks responded by early September and we made a decision by mid October. As a retailer, we didn’t want to change things in the pre-Christmas period, so we waited until this year for implementation. It is now live. The lead-time is possibly a full six months from inception to implementation. We gave ourselves enough time to do it properly. The banks’ own implementation teams also helped us. And it seems to have worked quite smoothly.</p>
<h5 id="which-banks-won-the-cash-and-cheque-business">Which banks won the cash and cheque business?</h5>
<p>Until this round, clearing services were provided by six banks, which we have now concentrated down to three. In England, Wales and Scotland we use HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland/NatWest. In Northern Ireland, we use Ulster Bank – which is part of the RBS Group – and Bank of Ireland in the Republic of Ireland.</p>
<h5 id="which-banks-won-the-card-business">Which banks won the card business?</h5>
<p>HSBC and Barclays Merchant Services. That’s done on price. The service is pretty straightforward. A key determinant for us though is telecoms cost. Because of fraud losses, banks always push for lower floor limits, which would cost us more in telecoms costs. Nevertheless our floor limits are coming down over time as telecoms costs come down and back of house systems speed up.</p>
<h5 id="how-about-the-introduction-of-pin-and-chips-on-credit-cards">How about the introduction of PIN and chips on credit cards? Your in-house systems are going to have to change – who is going to pay for that?</h5>
<p>We know we can upgrade but that it will cost. We know that the banks are prepared to make a modest contribution to that cost. At the moment, retailers in the British Retail Consortium believe that the benefits are too skewed towards the banks. The fight against fraud is in the interest of both banks and retailers. But if the bulk of the savings are going to be realised by the banks, whilst we have to bear the majority of the costs of implementation for little return, then something’s not quite right.</p>
<p>My other big gripe is with the non-negotiable, one per cent Interchange Fee that is payable to the big banks.</p>
<h5 id="what-do-you-do-with-any-surplus-cash">What do you do with any surplus cash?</h5>
<p>We sweep all our accounts every day. When we have floating debt, we use the surplus cash to pay that off. When we haven’t, as at the moment, we move the surplus into triple A-rated money market funds. Our next step is to set up a European pool on a daily basis to include our Irish and our very small German business.</p>
<h5 id="can-we-move-on-to-financial-risk-what-risks-do-you-face-and-how-do-you-measure-and-manage-them">Can we move on to financial risk? What risks do you face and how do you measure and manage them?</h5>
<p>We face three main risks. The first is foreign exchange risk. We have a small business in the Republic of Ireland and some franchises in Europe, the Middle East and the Far East. However, 95% of our trading is in the UK, and therefore in sterling, and our funding is sterling-based. Our main FX exposure is to clothing purchases around the globe, most of which is denominated in dollars. Our policy is to hedge it as far out as the business forecasts, providing a basic hedge to those forecasts. We are required to hedge 75% of our forecast exposure. Within this we have some flexibility, so we use a combination of forwards and options, which gives us some certainty of rate with the ability to participate if the rate moves in our favour.</p>
<p>The second financial risk is interest rate risk. We are offloading debt quite quickly now. At the end of August 2001, net debt stood at £140m, down from £256m a year before. We also have some long-term debt, which is fixed. Our policy is to provide a hedge for interest, by providing certainty to the interest cost in the profit and loss account.</p>
<p>Thirdly, a group of our size always has to manage financial covenants and report against them internally and to the treasury committee.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-use-technology">How do you use technology?</h5>
<p>We use banks’ own electronic banking systems (Hexagon from HSBC, RoyLine from RBS and BusinessMaster from Barclays), which allow us to make payments. These systems also tell us what cash we have in the bank and also allow us to predict end-of-day balances. We don’t have a treasury management system, although we do investigate these from time to time. Because we are a simple treasury function, we use simple PC based Excel systems to record our activities. There is no urgency to put in a treasury management system because what we have works.</p>
<p>We don’t use the Internet, mainly because I am not persuaded that it is secure and also because we would lose the personal interaction with our banks.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Continuing our popular series of interviews with senior figures in the world of treasury and finance, this month talking to Peter Rodger, Group Tax and Treasury Manager, Degussa UK Holdings Ltd.</p>
<div class="people right company">
<div class="vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Peter Rodger</h4>
<h5 class="title">Group Tax and Treasury Manager</h5>
<img alt="Degussa logo" class="logo org" height="22" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/degussa-logo-2002-70x22.png" title="Degussa" width="70"/>
</div>
<p>Degussa is the world’s largest speciality chemical company and is headquartered in Germany. Registered in September 2001, Degussa AG is the result of a merger between SKW Trostberg and Degussa-Hüls, which was originally agreed in October 2000. The company acquired Laporte plc in March 2001. Laporte plc manufactured and distributed speciality chemicals and performance materials. The corporate HQ of the former Laporte plc became Degussa UK Holdings Ltd.</p>
<p>Degussa is now organised into six divisions – Health &amp; Nutrition, Construction Chemicals, Fine &amp; Industrial Chemicals, Performance Chemicals, Coatings &amp; Advanced Fillers and Speciality Polymers. Its core operations currently generate sales of approximately €10 billion. The company has approximately 45,000 employees worldwide.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="how-has-the-takeover-by-degussa-affected-the-treasury-here">How has the takeover by Degussa affected the treasury here?</h5>
<p>Prior to the takeover to the merger with Degussa, we had sold 55% of the operating Group to KKR. This resulted in a reduction in staffing numbers at the head office (the former corporate headquarters for Laporte plc), which included combining tax and treasury. Tax and treasury were used to working very closely together in Laporte – whenever treasury wanted to set up a new funding structure, there were tax implications and, for any tax driven activity, cash movements were usually needed.</p>
<p>I was previously responsible for tax, but inherited an excellent Treasury team from my predecessor, so there was little additional work involved. However, the merger resulted in a further reduction in numbers. Of the two people working for me in treasury before the merger, the dealer left, because, post-merger, there were fewer deals required and we had a greater need for a cash manager. On the tax side, the position was the same – post-merger, fewer tax people were needed.</p>
<h5 id="what-was-degussas-perspective">What was Degussa’s perspective?</h5>
<p>Degussa’s view, like those of many multi-nationals, is that most treasury functions should be run, or at least controlled, from the centre. They took control of depositing and funding requirements very quickly. In addition, Degussa has its own in-house bank. We were left with two main responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>UK cash management.</h5>
<p>This runs through Barclays and we brought Degussa’s existing UK businesses within it. If necessary, it could be run from Germany, just as Laporte used to run its US cash management out of London.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Global cash pooling.</h5>
<p>Bank Mendes Gans (BMG) in the Netherlands ran the global cash pool for Laporte. We retained the management of that under Degussa for all the old Laporte companies. Degussa’s UK subsidiaries were also brought into it because they had come into our UK cash pooling. When the old Degussa subsidiaries joined the cash pool at Barclays, they closed all their existing foreign currency accounts. By joining the BMG system, they can pool with us and BMG does all their foreign currency hedging for them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="how-does-this-cash-pooling-system-work">How does this cash pooling system work?</h5>
<p>The BMG system provides a number of services principal of which is notional cross currency cash pooling. The old Laporte companies worldwide and the Degussa UK companies notionally pool their foreign currency balances within the BMG system. Surplus balances in the local functional currency cash pools for each territory can also be transferred to or from the pool, thereby ensuring the best use of surplus cash resources. Prior to Degussa’s involvement, this pool was balanced overnight by a UK company depositing or withdrawing a sterling amount. Since the change of control, this balancing function is performed in Euro with surplus cash transferred to Degussa AG Treasury in Germany and any shortage called upon from Germany.</p>
<p>We also run an internal forward currency hedging for the operating subsidiaries through BMG and use it for foreign currency payments.</p>
<p>Degussa have expressed interest in using the BMG system, but it is a complicated decision as Degussa has an in-house bank. At present, there is still a decision to be made about the future of the BMG system within the group – whether to continue as it is or to widen its sphere. Having said that, some of the territorial cash pools that we used to operate as Laporte now operate within Degussa’s local pooling because it made sense to use only one, just as it made sense for us to take Degussa’s UK subsidiaries into the UK pool. Any sterling surplus from the UK cash pool (run through Barclays) is cleared to an account with BMG.</p>
<h5 id="how-did-the-transition-work-within-the-treasury-department">Once Degussa’s takeover of Laporte took place, how did the transition work within the treasury department?</h5>
<p>The transition within the treasury department was probably one of the more efficient within the group. Degussa’s top management had taken a decision not to allow Degussa people to come in en masse straightaway – they didn’t want to be seen as heavy-handed. As we had already waited for three months from the original announcement to the completion of the acquisition in mid-March 2001, this was a bit frustrating, as it led to some uncertainty and decisions were required in some areas. The Degussa treasury team were one of the first to meet with Laporte in early to mid-April.</p>
<p>When the Degussa treasury team came, their first requirement was to find out what we did and what balances, currencies, funding structures etc existed. Once we had explained our positions to them, it was broadly up to them to decide how to move forward. I think that they had a fairly good idea as to what they wanted to do and these were ideas were expanded within the first few months. Everything that was going to be done was done by Christmas or soon after.</p>
<h5 id="what-did-they-decide">What did they decide?</h5>
<p>As a sterling group, Laporte had hedged against the euro. This was not appropriate for Degussa as a euro group, so these hedges came out fairly quickly. Laporte had a lot of balance sheet hedges in terms of swaps or currency borrowings. Degussa had hedged their investment in Laporte in a fairly general way, because they were unsure of what currency values they were going to need to hedge against. Most of the swaps were unwound by the end of the third quarter.</p>
<p>There was one exception, which was in respect of the dollar hedges, where Degussa’s position was the same as Laporte’s and they took a similar approach. We had some fairly long-term dollar funding with swaps on. Degussa decided to keep that for the time being, although that could change in the future.</p>
<h5 id="did-you-notice-a-difference-in-perspective">Did you notice a difference in perspective?</h5>
<p>The Degussa group treasury look at these exposures from a global Degussa position, as we did before the change of ownership. Now, however, we operate from a regional position. For example, whilst I might want to hedge my Dutch investments for my book, Degussa treasury would be taking a view from the perspective of the whole group.</p>
<p>In most cases, we made our comments and then Degussa took a global view. However, we also have a responsibility to make sure that the centre understands all the tax implications of any action. For example, before the merger, Laporte divested of some of its business, resulting in surplus cash. Degussa’s first instinct was that they wanted this surplus cash moved to Germany. I knew that it was probably not tax efficient to do that – although I didn’t know what the tax position in Germany was, I was fairly confident that we were paying less tax than they were.</p>
<h5 id="what-were-the-major-difficulties">What were the major difficulties?</h5>
<p>The transition was complicated by the fact that Degussa was also merging with another German company (SKW), which wasn’t formalised until after the Laporte acquisition because of the minority shareholders. This put the Degussa treasury under a lot of time pressure and I don’t think that they were able to react to the acquisition of Laporte as quickly as they would have liked.</p>
<p>Secondly, the reporting requirements were quite difficult to get used to. Degussa now reports under US GAAP. We were probably in a better position to comply with US GAAP than the centre in Germany – UK GAAP is closer to US GAAP than the German equivalent. Under US GAAP, we have to report all the balances and value all the derivatives quarterly. The first report was due in June. This was time-consuming as it always is initially. However, another reason was that there was a lack of clarity as to what was required from both sides and some things were confused in translation. But having done it once, the report is relatively straightforward to complete again.</p>
<h5 id="how-are-you-held-responsible-now">How are you held responsible now?</h5>
<p>My functions are now more tax based and most of the treasury interaction is with the UK cash manager. I see my treasury role as more of a control function within what remains of the UK treasury department. As I mentioned, we are still responsible for the currency hedging for the former Laporte subsidiaries. These companies provide a rolling 12 month currency forecast each month, which can cover any currency, but the main currencies are US dollars, Euros and sterling for the non-UK companies. Every month the net amounts are then hedged externally. Effectively the UK treasury department is entering internal forward contracts with each operating company and balancing the net differences externally.</p>
<p>Degussa has a very detailed quarterly cash reporting system. It would be too complicated to report all the internal hedges for each subsidiary, as that could result in around 250 individual contracts per subsidiary every quarter. After some discussion, it was agreed that no benefit would arise from increasing the workload to report all these internal contracts.</p>
<p>We also talk regularly to Germany and they do ask us questions. Most of these questions come up after the accounting at the end of every quarter. Mostly these questions will be put directly to the cash manager. My interaction is now limited to one-offs, usually tax-treasury deals.</p>
<h5 id="how-about-internal-controls">How about internal controls?</h5>
<p>We do have controls here and, to some extent, we carry on with what we have always done. We have changed the authorisation limits such that they are now more restrictive than they used to be. We did this because we felt that the previous authorisation levels were set too high for what we now have to do. The UK head office management proposed the new authority limits to the head office in Germany.</p>
<h5 id="are-there-any-lessons-that-you-can-draw-from-your-experiences-of-both-taking-over-other-companies-and-being-taken-over">Are there any lessons that you can draw from your experiences of both taking over other companies and being taken over?</h5>
<p>It is important to take a transition in stages. I think that Degussa did do this well.</p>
<p>The first stage should involve the acquiring company gathering information about the acquired company’s treasury. This should involve identifying what happens, what systems are in place, whether it works and whether the acquired company performs any of these tasks better than the acquiring company.</p>
<p>Once the information has been acquired it is important not to impose anything too quickly – if you try to force the pace on any issue, then the new subsidiaries will be against that change. This was important when we were integrating the UK Degussa companies into the UK and BMG cash pooling systems. Although Degussa was taking over Laporte, it had been determined by Degussa treasury that the UK Degussa companies would come into the UK cash pool. The nine legacy UK Degussa companies had enjoyed greater control over their businesses, with no experience of doing anything centrally, such that they used all the UK high street banks between them. Integrating them was fairly straightforward – we introduced them to Barclays, who opened the accounts. Because of the need to sell the idea to the business units, it took a little longer than the six weeks that I thought it would. The managers were receptive to the idea because they could see the benefits, although they were a little nervous about the loss of control and, in particular, working with the BMG system. However, once they did the first deal with BMG they could immediately see the benefits as it released them from half a day a week spent balancing transactions.</p>
<p>With a merger, the question is to find the most efficient way of putting two systems together. The timing is crucial – there is always a reason why it can’t be done this week. It is also important not to antagonise people. The majority of people will come in gradually – the ones who are difficult will need something from the centre sooner or later and will then see the benefit of the change. It’s not just about self-interest, but people are nervous of change and don’t like it being imposed on them.</p>
<h5 id="do-you-think-this-is-true">Group treasurers tell me that local treasurers are usually pleased to give up the responsibility. Do you think this is true?</h5>
<p>Yes, in most cases. Cash spending has to be controlled within a budget. Any large projects have to be justified anyway. Working capital has to be managed and controlled within the established framework. The local treasurer, who is normally the accountant handling all aspects of finance, does not want to worry about the cost of finance and where to get it, when the group treasury is expert in that.</p>
<p>There are exceptions. It is usually the finance director (rather than treasurer) of a small company who is affected the most. They don’t mind losing the day-to-day hassle, but sometimes, particularly in some countries, they feel a loss of status in the local community. The only people who are likely to get upset are those who have ambitions to be a group finance director and therefore need to keep abreast of the latest developments.</p>
<h5 id="does-this-argument-work-for-you">Does this argument work for you?</h5>
<p>That’s a leading question! There wouldn’t have been a job for me if I had just been doing the treasury role, however I still have a lot of legacy tax issues to deal with – these will take up to two years to sort out. In most takeovers, even in cross border deals such as this, I would expect the treasury function to disappear within twelve months except if it became an adjunct of the corporate centre.</p></div>

<h3 class="sub-heading copy__sub-heading"></h3>
<div class="copy__body"><p>Continuing our popular series of interviews with senior figures in the world of treasury and finance, this month talking to John O’Driscoll, Group Director of Treasury &amp; Corporate Finance, BG Group.</p>
<div class="people right company">
<div class="vcard">
<h4 class="fn">John O’Driscoll</h4>
<h5 class="title">Group Director of Treasury &amp; Corporate Finance</h5>
<img alt="BG Group logo" class="logo org" height="60" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/bg-group-2002-logo-60x60.png" title="BG Group" width="60"/>
</div>
<p>BG is an integrated gas major, and its core business is the development, management and supply of existing and newly emerging gas markets around the world. It is active in all aspects of the gas chain, including exploration and production (which represents between 60% and 70% of the business), transmission and distribution, liquefied natural gas (‘LNG’) and power.</p>
<p>BG is active in over 20 countries worldwide. The UK is still important with the North Sea still representing close to half of the group’s production. It also has major activities in Latin America, Kazakhstan, Egypt, Trinidad and India. In market capitalisation terms, at approximately £9.5 billion, BG ranks 26<sup>th</sup> in the FTSE-100 and is the largest of the three successor companies to British Gas – the others being Lattice Group (Transco) and Centrica.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="as-treasurer-for-what-are-you-responsible-how-have-you-structured-the-treasury">As treasurer, for what are you responsible? How have you structured the treasury?</h5>
<p>There are five main sections within the BG treasury. The first two are what would be considered the core treasury functions.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Funding and investment.</h5>
<p>This has responsibility for all core funding, bank relationships, credit ratings and interest rate and foreign exchange risk management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>The core back office.</h5>
<p>Including banking operations and settlement.</p>
</li>
<p>We then have three further sections that, whilst not unique to BG, do assume a higher profile here:</p>
<li>
<h5>A structured finance team.</h5>
<p>Because of the nature of our business, we use a lot of project finance. For example, where we are developing an LNG facility (that cools gas into a liquefied form so that it can be transported by ship), we may choose to use non-recourse finance. This work can provide a different emphasis for the BG treasury compared to treasuries elsewhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Corporate finance.</h5>
<p>This covers anything that we are doing on the equity or balance sheet structuring side – such as doing buy-backs, convertibles and the dividend policy (although this is determined by the board with input from ourselves).</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Insurance.</h5>
<p>I am also responsible for the Group’s insurance programme, which takes up about 15% of my time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We also have treasury managers in Brazil and Singapore, who look after any treasury issues in those regions. Although as a treasury we are very centralised, where necessary they will coordinate activity locally, for example for any project financing.</p>
<p>Although British Gas has been around for a long time, BG Group in its current form only came into existence in late 2000. This meant that we had the opportunity to start the treasury effectively from scratch, which was a major part of the initial challenge of this job. For example, all of the policies on foreign exchange risk management had to be rewritten and revised to make them fit the shape of the new group. This is because whereas the old group was completely dominated by sterling cash flows, BG has more foreign currency flows and so foreign exchange risk is a huge issue.</p>
<h5 id="how-are-you-held-accountable">How are you held accountable?</h5>
<p>I report to the Finance Director, who is on the main board. There is also a Finance Committee of the board, consisting of the Chairman, Chief Exec and Finance Director, which has remit for treasury and finance issues. I report to them at quarterly meetings. The board has delegated most of its finance responsibilities to its Finance Committee.</p>
<p>As a treasury, we act as a cost centre. What derivative activity we do have here is for hedging existing positions; we don’t trade on our own account.</p>
<h5 id="as-a-new-entity-how-have-you-approached-funding-issues">As a new entity, how have you approached funding issues?</h5>
<p>The former British Gas had a huge debt book, most of which went on demerger to Transco, the regulated utility. As a result, BG has got relatively low levels of debt – our gearing at the end of the third quarter of 2001 was 17%.</p>
<p>Because we are essentially a new credit, we have had to establish ourselves since we demerged. The first step was to get credit ratings. We have three – at the moment we have low single A from Moody’s and Fitch and from S&amp;P, BBB+ , with a positive outlook that we are hoping will translate into an upgrade before very long.</p>
<p>We then put in place the key components of the funding structure. They are:-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Committed lines.</h5>
<p>The first thing we put in place was a series of bilateral committed lines ($1.25 billion) from a group of relationship banks. I might say here that relationship banking is key to the way we manage treasury operations in BG; we do try and put business wherever possible to this group of banks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A USCP programme, $1 billion in size.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our portfolio of uncommitted lines is about $750m, which enables us to do bills and acceptances and money market borrowing.</p>
</li>
</ul></div></div></div>]]></complete_body>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Continuing our popular series of interviews with senior figures in the world of treasury and finance, this month talking to Alan Royle, Director of Treasury, Amersham plc. Alan Royle retired as Director of Treasury at the end of December 2001.</p>
<div class="people right company">
<div class="vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Alan Royle</h4>
<h5 class="title">Director of Treasury</h5>
<img alt="Amersham plc logo" class="logo org" height="29" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/amersham-logo-2002-100x29.png" title="Amersham plc" width="100"/>
</div>
<p>Amersham plc has an annual turnover of £1.4 billion and is listed on the London, New York and Oslo stock exchanges. It consists of two businesses – Amersham Health and Amersham Biosciences. Amersham Health is a research-based pharmaceutical company that develops diagnostic imaging products for health-care professionals. Amersham Biosciences provides biotechnology products and services used in the discovery and development of drugs. The company’s main manufacturing activities are in the UK, the USA, Sweden and Norway.</p>
<p>As Amersham International, the company was the first major privatisation by the Thatcher government in 1982. In 1997, Amersham International merged its life sciences division with Pharmacia Biotech (the life sciences division of Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn). Three weeks later, Amersham International merged with the Norwegian company, Nycomed. The group was known as Nycomed Amersham until it was rebranded as Amersham plc in October 2001.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="how-is-the-group-treasury-organised">How is the group treasury organised?</h5>
<p>The treasury function within Amersham plc is highly centralised. Apart from here (corporate HQ), there is a limited treasury presence within the group.</p>
<p>We operate as the classic in-house bank and finance all of our businesses throughout the world from here. There are some very minor exceptions, such as China for example, where we have some local funding. However, even this local funding is done under our auspices.</p>
<p>Within group treasury, there is a group of seven people. I have two treasurers reporting to me:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Treasurer. International – responsible for all the financial risk management (foreign exchange and interest rate), dealing and international cash management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treasurer, Banking and Operations – works directly with me on the group financing and relationship management side of the business. In addition he is responsible for the installation and maintenance of the systems and operations we rely on to run this business.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these people has two people reporting to them. The Treasurer, International has an international cash manager and a dealer. The Treasurer, Banking and Operations has a financial analyst and an administrator performing support functions including inputting to the computer systems. The back office function (dealing with confirmations/deal administration) is largely performed outside treasury by the accounting department. I also have insurance reporting to me.</p>
<h5 id="how-are-you-held-accountable">How are you held accountable?</h5>
<p>This is a fairly classic cost centre. We have rigid controls in terms of our dealing activities, with all our authority levels sanctioned by the board of directors, and we report formally to the board on a monthly basis.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-structure-your-liquidity-management-operations">Group treasury is centralised and the company has operations in a number of locations. How do you structure your liquidity management operations?</h5>
<p>In most countries, we have integrated our companies into our global cash management operation, which we operate through JPMorgan Chase. Typically, each subsidiary has an account with JPMorgan Chase in their country, even if it is not its principal operating bank account. Global treasury also has an account in that country. These accounts zero balance everyday. So, for example, in the US, we have a number of different accounts denominated in dollars for different companies plus the umbrella account held by Amersham plc.</p>
<p>Every company can draw on its JPMorgan Chase account to fund itself (or should it find itself with a cash surplus, that is soaked up centrally via the JPMorgan Chase account every day). This financing is done on an arm’s length basis at market interest rates – we have loan agreements with all our subsidiaries. This structure means that if a subsidiary has to pay a bill, it can do so electronically, knowing that its account will automatically be zero balanced at the end of the day (with the global treasury account being debited). Generally speaking, it works very well.</p>
<h5 id="are-there-any-locations-where-it-doesnt-work-so-well">Are there any locations where it doesn’t work so well?</h5>
<p>We have significant banking requirements in Scandinavia, due to our activities in Norway, Sweden and Denmark. Because JPMorgan Chase does not have a major physical presence in Scandinavia, we are in the process of putting in place a pan-Scandinavian cash management system using a Scandinavian bank. This regional cash pool will be an exception to the rule, although it will link into the main JPMorgan Chase cash pool.</p>
<h5 id="what-do-you-do-with-any-cash-surpluses-that-are-generated">What do you do with any cash surpluses that are generated?</h5>
<p>Traditionally they have been used to pay down borrowings. At the moment, we have effectively no short-term borrowings so we are using them to fund the activities of either the parent company or a company that does have a requirement. Typically we are channelling funds through Amersham plc using, for example, cash from Amersham Health (which generates a lot of cash) to fund Amersham Biosciences.</p>
<p>When we do have short-term cash to invest through Amersham plc, we often use the bank’s liquidity (money) funds. These are very flexible, generating a good return whilst being able to take the money out at any time and at very short notice.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-your-risk-management-responsibilities">What are your risk management responsibilities?</h5>
<p>In treasury, I have the responsibility for the management of two kinds of risk – financial risk (foreign exchange and interest rate risks) and the risk of our physical assets, i.e. insurance.</p>
<p>We self-insure to a reasonable extent through our captive insurance operations that are principally in Ireland.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-measure-and-manage-the-key-financial-risks-foreign-exchange-and-interest-rate">How do you measure and manage the key financial risks (foreign exchange and interest rate)?</h5>
<p>We have board-approved policies for both foreign exchange and interest rate risk management.</p>
<p>Our main foreign exchange exposures are, on one side, our receipts of US dollars, Japanese Yen and Euros and, on the other side, the exposure to Swedish Krona and Norwegian Krone.</p>
<p>In transactional terms, we have both tactical and strategic components to our hedging programme, both of which are very firmly prescribed giving us virtually no discretion over what to hedge and what not to hedge. From a tactical standpoint, we are always hedged six months out for our key transactional currencies. In addition, we have a strategic component whereby we will be hedged in certain circumstances (based on purchasing power parity) up to three years out in our key currencies.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-the-issues-on-interest-rate-risk">What are the issues on interest rate risk?</h5>
<p>At the moment, we have a very straightforward approach, which is based on fixed-floating percentages. However, we plan to put in place a more scientific approach using duration.</p>
<h5 id="what-instruments-do-you-use-to-hedge-the-currency-risk">What instruments do you use to hedge the currency risk?</h5>
<p>We do mainly plain vanilla forward deals and swaps and we also enter into some options.</p>
<h5 id="how-have-you-been-affected-by-the-fas-133">How have you been affected by the FAS 133?</h5>
<p>Because we have substantial US assets, we have had to do a lot of work over the last couple of years so that we could report under FAS133, which we are now doing.</p>
<h5 id="has-it-changed-what-you-have-been-able-to-do-at-all">Has it changed what you have been able to do at all?</h5>
<p>No, it hasn’t. One of the concerns of the Technical Committee of the Association of Corporate Treasurers (on which I sit) has been that people would start to do dysfunctional things if the accounting treatment (either under FAS 133 or the UK equivalent) rather than economics were to determine action. Although we haven’t changed the way that we deal, we have had to both measure our exposures more carefully and make sure that what we are hedging is compatible with FAS 133</p>
<h5 id="you-also-have-responsibility-for-funding-the-activities-of-the-group-how-do-you-do-that">You also have responsibility for funding the activities of the group. How do you do that?</h5>
<p>Traditionally this company has lived largely on bank financing. At the moment, we have two main sources of finance – we have some US dollar denominated private placements and the rest is bank financing. When this group was put together in 1997, a bank facility of £975m was put in place to facilitate the mergers. Because the company generates a substantial amount of positive cash flow and we have divested some business, we have brought down our borrowings fairly consistently so that we currently have net debt of only approximately £50m.</p>
<p>However, strategic initiatives mean that the debt position will probably not stay that way. When we need to raise money, we will look at the full range of potential sources of finance – it is quite possible that we will look to tap the public markets although at the moment we are not rated by the ratings agencies. We would probably use some measure of bank debt as we do today and we may, depending on the amount we need to raise , raise funds through equity or convertibles as well.</p>
<p>We are also just in the process of replacing our existing bank facility. We have finalised the evaluation of what we are going to put in place. Our existing facility (from 1997) has 26 banks in it. The new facility will have a much smaller number. The core of the banking strategy that feeds into the new facility is that we will slim down the number of relationships that we have to between ten and fifteen. We know that banks are thinking about their relationships differently now. They are not in the ‘do business at any cost’ mode any more and are concentrating on their return on these relationships. By having a smaller number of banks, there is an opportunity for each bank to make a reasonable return out of the relationship in return for putting up their money.</p>
<p>This process of renegotiating the new facility is already underway and should be in place soon.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-use-technology">How do you use technology?</h5>
<p>The treasury management system (we currently use TRACTS from Simcorp and are in the process of migrating to IT/2) is used to manage our treasury and back office operations and is at the heart of everything that we do here. We also use the Chase Insight system for electronic funds transfer and gathering bank information. Atriax will be the principal example of where we use technology externally. And we have Bloomberg and Reuters for information purposes.</p>
<p>We are considering using the company’s Intranet to allow the subsidiaries to access the system to see, for example, what their balance with us is at any point in time and also to be able to input their data directly into the netting system which will remove a large element of manual interface.</p>
<h5 id="you-mentioned-atriax">You mentioned Atriax.</h5>
<p>We have just completed our first trade using Atriax.</p>
<h5 id="what-attracted-you-to-the-idea-of-foreign-exchange-trading-on-the-internet-and-to-atriax-in-particular">What attracted you to the idea of foreign exchange trading on the Internet and to Atriax in particular?</h5>
<p>We do a lot of foreign exchange trading in terms of number of transactions, since we are dealing in respect of known merchandise flows and are updating our positions all the time. We have watched fairly closely the evolution of the systems like Atriax. Over time, we have got more comfortable with the concept, although whether it will be for all foreign exchange dealing or just for some remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Most of the banks that we deal with are in Atriax so that was the logical system for us, if we were going to try this approach. Our first foray into it seems to have worked very well, although it is still very early days.</p>
<h5 id="what-were-the-issues-that-needed-to-be-resolved-before-you-went-ahead">You have mentioned some of the things that attracted you to the service, what were the issues that needed to be resolved before you went ahead?</h5>
<p>Although this is stating the obvious in some senses, we needed something that was going to be secure. We didn’t want any input information to be open to the world. Typically we quote competitively for most of our deals, which means phoning around. The logic of, for example, Atriax is being able to replicate that without phoning around. We became comfortable with the fact that the banks said that the service was secure and that we would continue to get the competitive service that we were getting anyway (and perhaps an even more competitive service). We determine the banks that we are willing to have quote on a transaction (these are banks that we know and deal with anyway). We have tried it and so far the signs are good. That doesn’t mean that we will be doing all our deals that way – there are certain deals where we will still want to do the deal over the phone. I can see us trading using a mix of these two methods going forward.</p>
<h5 id="what-do-you-consider-to-be-the-biggest-change-that-you-have-seen-during-your-career-in-treasury">As you look back what do you consider to be the biggest change that you have seen during your career in treasury?</h5>
<p>Technology has obviously changed in leaps and bounds – our reliance on computers to perform our daily activities has grown dramatically over the last ten to fifteen years.</p>
<p>However, within the treasury business one thing that has changed and gained momentum in the last few years is bank consolidation. Some of the banks that I have dealt with over the years and that were household names either no longer exist or have been absorbed within even larger organisations – think of Chemical Bank and Chase Manhattan in the US. The composition of the banking industry has changed in terms of what the banks actually do. The distinction between investment banks and commercial banks has become blurred – they all now provide a full array of products – enabling us to ‘one-stop shop’. This is probably the biggest change. And I think we will still see more consolidation.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Continuing our popular series of interviews with senior figures in the world of treasury and finance, this month talking to Marc Navalon, Group Treasurer, AGBAR.</p>
<div class="people right company">
<div class="vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Marc Navalon</h4>
<h5 class="title">Group Treasurer</h5>
<img alt="AGBAR logo" class="logo org" height="51" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/agbar-logo-2001-60x51.png" title="AGBAR" width="60"/>
</div>
<p>The AGBAR Group is a Barcelona-headquartered company that employs 45,000 people worldwide. The activities of the company and its 200 subsidiaries are organised into five main divisions – water, solid waste, health, automotive services and electronic commerce. The company originated in 1867 as Compagnie des Eaux de Barcelone (which supplied drinking water to towns close to Barcelona), changing its name to Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona in 1882 – the water division remains dominant within the company today. AGBAR provides water services to 37m people in Spain and Latin America and the water division provided 61.8% of the company’s net income of €2.2 billion in 2000.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="as-group-treasurer-for-what-are-you-responsible-within-agbar">As group treasurer, for what are you responsible within AGBAR?</h5>
<p>I am chief of the corporate treasury department in AGBAR, which we set up in January 1999. As group treasurer, I have responsibilities in three main areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5>Cash management.</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Risk management.</h5>
<p>This is mainly financial risk, but from time to time I have to manage some other business risks as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Funding.</h5>
<p>I am also responsible for funding through the capital markets.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="how-is-the-treasury-structured">How is the treasury structured?</h5>
<p>There are four of us in the central treasury department. I have two treasury assistants – one has responsibility for the capital and derivatives markets and the other is responsible for cash management and managing our domestic bank relationships. Our fourth member is the secretary.</p>
<p>AGBAR Group has more than 200 companies. The core business activities are drinking water – including water collection, supply and integrated services in cities and towns through concessions and rental agreements – healthcare insurance, liquid and solid waste treatment and automobile services. Other areas of activity include construction and engineering, maintenance and electronic trade services. This complexity implies that as well as having a central treasury department, each of the five main business divisions in the group has a senior treasurer. That senior treasurer is directly responsible for the treasury activity within that division. I meet with these five senior treasurers every two months as a treasury committee.</p>
<h5 id="how-does-this-structure-work-in-practice">How does this structure work in practice?</h5>
<p>Although in general terms within the group we have a strong culture of decentralisation, in finance the divisions see us in the central treasury department as experts and we do give advice and help to those who need it. In recent years, this help has included internal long-term loans funded by our bond issuance.</p>
<p>Although we do not try to impose anything on any of our divisions, I would like to underline that I am convinced that, in treasury, centralisation tends to work better than decentralisation. With that in mind, we are preparing to increase the role of the central treasury department, with respect to that of the divisions.</p>
<h5 id="risk-management-how-do-you-measure-and-manage-currency-and-interest-rate-risk">Risk management – how do you measure and manage currency and interest rate risk?</h5>
<p>First, I would like to emphasise that as a group we have a very conservative approach to risk. Our role as the treasury is to protect the results of the group, rather than to generate profits ourselves. As a result, we use derivatives for hedging exposures rather than for taking positions with a view to generating income for the group.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, the risks that we face are primarily financial – currency and interest rate risks. Of these, currency risk is now more important than interest rate risk in terms of its impact on the group’s profit and loss account. This is the result of a large investment that we made in 1999, when we bid for the company providing water management services in the Chilean capital, Santiago. This bid was financed in euro, rather than in the local currency (the Chilean Peso). As well as this significant investment in Chile, we also have investments in many other Latin American countries (including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Mexico and Uruguay) and also in the United States.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-approach-the-issue-of-appointing-banks">Bank relationships – with over 200 subsidiaries, how do you approach the issue of appointing banks?</h5>
<p>For me, the issue of managing bank relationships is both key and complicated. Banks like to project themselves as experts in the majority of products that a corporate will need to use, whereas in practice this may not be the case.</p>
<p>In order to save us time it is very important that the bank understands our approach to derivatives and financing. Because banks are made of people, the key to a good bank relationship is to find the right people. If we can find the right people, then a lot of the work has already been done.</p>
<p>Domestically, there has been a lot of change in Spanish banking. In Spain there are now only two big domestic banks with international presence (BBVA and BSCH) followed by a number of medium-sized banks. This has made negotiating with banks much more difficult as the number of banks offering the necessary range of services has shrunk.</p>
<p>The subsidiaries face different pressures. Because of the nature of our business and the fact that we have made a number of acquisitions, there is a very long list of banks with which we have had relationships. Although we have spent the last few years trying to reduce the number of banks with whom we relate, this has not been that easy. Because our main businesses are selling water and waste management services, we have municipalities as our customers. For commercial reasons, this makes it difficult to try to remove a relationship in a particular area. So, although we have reduced our number of banks to a core of about half a dozen, there still remains a long list of banks with whom we have very localised relationships.</p>
<p>So we are faced with a paradox. It appears that we have a long list of banks with which we can do business. But we need our banks to provide us with a package of financing and other services, whereas many of the smaller banks can provide only some of those services. This means that, in Spain, we really only have two or three realistic banking partners.</p>
<p>Having said that, we have been investing in Latin America, as have the two Spanish banks (now the two largest banks in Latin America). As a result, they can provide us with significant help for our expansion into Latin America.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-the-issues-that-need-to-be-resolved-for-a-company-with-operations-in-both-spain-and-latin-america">Cash management – what are the issues that need to be resolved for a company with operations in both Spain and Latin America?</h5>
<p>In Spain, the banking industry is quite developed and automated. For example, we have been using standard Bank Account Numbers for some time. There are no big nightmares in cash management – for example, we operate notional cash pooling and cash concentration relatively easily.</p>
<p>We also pay our suppliers using ‘Confirming’, which is a BSCH-registered trademark. We can send a file of invoices to the bank, which the bank will then process. In addition, because payment terms in Spain are very long relative to Northern Europe (90 or 120 days), the bank will also offer invoice discounting to our suppliers. In practice, when the bank receives the instructions from us, it will send a notification to our supplier. This confirms that we have accepted their invoice and also offers to discount that invoice at attractive rates of interest.</p>
<p>In Latin America, cash management is more complicated. A much lower proportion of the local population has bank accounts. Whilst in Spain, our main method of collection is via the direct debit, this is not possible in Latin America. We have to build a varied network of collection points, using banks but also other points of collection such as supermarkets.</p>
<h5 id="does-this-mean-that-cash-management-is-locally-organised">Does this mean that cash management is locally organised?</h5>
<p>Given the differences in local practices, we think that local teams are in the best position to establish the most effective collection and payment processing systems. In the medium term, we are considering establishing some form of cross border cash pooling. However, at the moment, local regulations and fiscal requirements make this nearly impossible.</p>
<h5 id="once-you-have-collected-the-cash-in-latin-america-what-do-you-do-with-it">Once you have collected the cash in Latin America, what do you do with it?</h5>
<p>Whilst we would like to bring it back to Spain, we have to look at the constraints of the local currency. In many ways, it is more feasible to keep the funds there, particularly if it means that the subsidiaries can become self-financing. Whether we can bring the cash back to Spain also depends on whether there are any constraints on the subsidiaries and, in certain Latin American countries, on the local authority’s attitude to tax.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-approach-this">You also mentioned that you have responsibility for funding. How do you approach this?</h5>
<p>I manage our MTN programme, which we established in 1999 and through which we issue bonds on the Euromarket. The programme is worth €2 billion and we have issued €675m to date. We have used the programme to finance our foreign direct investments (in Chile and other countries) and also to replace some bank financing as well. It provides us with an opportunity to raise long-term financing which the banks are not in the best position to provide. The programme is very flexible – we can issue 5, 10, 15 and, given our excellent ratings (AA-, Aa3), even 30 year bonds. We have also managed to increase the average duration of our debt portfolio at a time when capital is becoming scarcer.</p>
<p>Our subsidiary in Chile has been able to issue bonds after our acquisition. The local bond market is very developed and it was successfully able to issue 5 year and 21 year bonds in very difficult circumstances on September 14<sup>th</sup> this year.</p>
<p>In Argentina, the position is different. The bond market is not as developed, so most of the long-term funding comes from multilaterals – such as the IFC, the EIB and the Inter-American Development Bank.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-use-technology">How do you use technology?</h5>
<p>I see technology as key for treasury – the role of the treasurer is in fact to manage information, not money. After all, I don’t touch bank notes at all!. We have Reuters at the central treasury and our major subsidiaries have a treasury management system – XRT Cerg Finance – which they use to improve the quality of information within the treasury and thus their daily management.</p>
<p>At the moment, we are considering what the technological structure of our treasury should be once we have increased its centralisation. There are now more alternatives than there were a few years ago – including the Internet and ASPs.</p>
<h5 id="do-you-use-the-internet-at-all">Do you use the Internet at all?</h5>
<p>We use the Internet for research and for bank account reporting. We have been contacted by an FX portal, but we only conduct a small number of deals (not even one a day) and so have limited transaction risk. In addition, the deals we do conduct are not straightforward – for example, a three year, cross currency swap of Euro and Chilean pesos – and so the portal would not add significant value.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-the-most-important-issue-for-you-in-the-immediate-future">What is the most important issue for you in the immediate future?</h5>
<p>In the immediate future we are moving towards a higher degree of centralisation. But centralisation is not a goal, it is a means. Our objective remains to add value to the group by improving our cash, risk and funding management and also by maintaining strong relations with other departments. Given the decentralised complexity of the group, it is vital to focus on properly managing this centralisation process.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Continuing our popular series of interviews with senior figures in the world of treasury and finance, this month talking to Steve Harper, European Treasurer, Flextronics.</p>
<div class="people right company">
<div class="vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Steve Harper</h4>
<h5 class="title">European Treasurer</h5>
<img alt="Flextronics" class="logo org" height="11" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/flextronic-logo-2011-126x11.png" title="Flextronics" width="126"/>
</div>
<p>Flextronics employs 70,000 people in 100 manufacturing locations in 27 countries on 4 continents. It is headquartered in Singapore and is operated from San José, California. As the world’s 2<sup>nd</sup> largest Electronics Manufacturing Services provider, Flextronics makes almost anything that contains a chip (such as printers, washing machines CD and DVD players) for big customers such as Philips, Ericsson, Alcatel, Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard. As an outsourced manufacturing company, Flextronics offers everything from design, manufacture, assembly and delivery through its own logistics tracking system.</p>
<p>In an effort to keep the costs of manufacturing as low as possible, the company tends to produce in low-cost production countries – typically Mexico, China, Poland and Hungary.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="how-is-the-companys-treasury-structured">How is the company’s treasury structured?</h5>
<p>As a company, Flextronics has grown very fast, from a turnover of $93m in 1993, to $12.1 billion in 2001. This growth has come been created both internally (about 60%) and by acquisition (about 40%). When making acquisitions, you take on the expertise, the people and the culture of the companies you acquire, meaning that Flextronics is a very diverse group. It also makes Flextronics a challenging company to draw together.</p>
<p>To achieve this growth, Flextronics likes decentralisation and flexibility, with everybody empowered to take quick decisions to meet customers’ needs. But it has realised that its core functions such as tax and treasury really need to be centralised.</p>
<p>The treasury function is split. There is a head office treasury function based in San José, California. There is a very small concern in Asia. My remit is to build up the European treasury centre, which is what I am undertaking to do right now.</p>
<h5 id="how-have-you-designed-the-european-treasury-centre">How have you designed the European treasury centre?</h5>
<p>In terms of the vehicle for that, we have identified a structure that’s not been explored particularly by other companies. We are using a Swiss branch structure for the treasury centre, but rather than use the typical Dutch or Luxembourg holding, we are using an Austrian holding company. To achieve this, we have a Swiss branch in Solothurn that’s owned by the Vienna-based holding company. We can have most of our staff in Vienna (which is already the location of one of the two European regional head offices, the other being in Karlskrona in Sweden) and we just need minimal representation in Switzerland to satisfy the authorities concerning the seat of business.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons for choosing Vienna. Firstly, we like to keep our treasury centres and our service functions as close to the core manufacturing businesses as possible. We have major operating units in Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland and are examining possibilities in the Ukraine. From Vienna we can get to any of the sites within two hours and get into direct contact with all the people who are actually producing, assembling or providing the forecasts, data or cashflow. Although we can operate on the telephone, sometimes visibility is required from treasury personnel.</p>
<p>Secondly, we have negotiated a tax rate inclusive of both the Swiss ruling and the Austrian ruling [the respective tax authorities issue a ruling which states what is acceptable business for the treasury centre to conduct] that amounts to something in the low single digit numbers. Our business incorporates some low margin business elements, so costs and tax are major issues. We have a very low corporate tax rate for a company of our size, something in the region of 12%.</p>
<p>Thirdly, just because we are in Vienna, it doesn’t mean that we exclusively use Austrian banks – we maintain our core banking relationships in most of the major financial centres with large banking institutions.</p>
<h5 id="for-what-is-the-treasury-centre-responsible">For what is the treasury centre responsible?</h5>
<p>Which specific tasks are assigned to the treasury centre depends very much on the ruling and what it allows to be performed. Under very loose terms, described by us as short-term liquidity – ie any money less than three years – our treasury centre is responsible for all the foreign exchange, the short-term money flows, cash planning and cash pooling. The longer term strategic funding is outside the remit of the treasury centre and will still come from outside sources, often the parent. Treasury is also responsible for all the leasing throughout the company, which is fairly substantial given the type of machinery we use to manufacture our products. We act as the in-house bank and the external point of contact. As the treasury centre, we are allowed under FAS 133 to net foreign exchange exposures, using forecasts submitted by every subsidiary. We will then offer internal trade tickets to subsidiaries. Finally we net off our exposures and lay off to the outside world to core banks in the major money centres. This ensures that we are getting the best pricing.</p>
<p>From the subsidiary’s view point we are taking away something from them – liquidity management – that (a) they didn’t really want, (b) they weren’t very good at and (c) something that wasn’t very cost efficient. What we left them with was purely the responsibility of submitting their forecast, which they have to do – in a business as diverse as ours, we can assist and we can check and we can inquire, but this information has to come from the production units themselves.</p>
<p>We also undertake, within the wider group treasury, to do a fair amount of training – on the FAS issues, on the forecasting issues. In such a decentralised business, somebody has to take on the mantle of selling the best practices. We also answer a lot of rather generic enquiries. At the moment, we are just as much an educational as a treasury centre, although I think that will change moving forward.</p>
<h5 id="when-did-you-start-thinking-about-the-centralised-treasury-centre">When did you start thinking about the centralised treasury centre?</h5>
<p>We started at the beginning of this year. The longest time has been in getting the rulings, a process which has taken close on eight months.</p>
<h5 id="you-needed-to-get-rulings-from-both-austria-and-switzerland">You needed to get rulings from both Austria and Switzerland?</h5>
<p>Correct. In the interim, whilst that was going on, we were able to go ahead because we got a verbal clarification that the ruling was going to be accepted. This meant that we could start building our team, reviewing the systems so that we could ensure the connectivity and planning what we are going to transfer at what time. But whilst the process of moving the degree of control to the treasury centre started once we got the verbal clarification, we couldn’t deal in the name of the treasury centre until we got the ruling, because no bank would accept dealing in an unregistered name. This means that currently the treasury centre is having to deal in the names of the entities for and on their behalf.</p>
<h5 id="how-easy-is-it-to-set-up-a-european-cash-management-structure">How easy is it to set up a European cash management structure?</h5>
<p>When looking at cash management and cash pooling, it would be wrong for us and for any bank to say that one bank can cater for all of our European needs, given our diversity. We have looked at in-country or regional cross-country solutions, with a view of ultimately moving towards a pan-European overlay. However with some of the central and Eastern European countries, we couldn’t start at that level, rather we have got to build it up gradually.</p>
<h5 id="which-ones-have-you-found-to-be-the-easy-ones-and-which-ones-the-hard-ones">You talked about the diversity of the countries for which you are setting up. Which ones have you found to be the easy ones and which ones the hard ones?</h5>
<p>It is very quick and easy to set up pooling arrangements in the Nordics, primarily because it is quite common and quite well understood. Secondly the choice of banks that operate effectively in the Nordics is very limited – there is a choice basically of about three banks, and two of those are every other banks’ common partner in that part of the world. Ireland was also a very easy country in which to set up. In central and Eastern Europe, we are working for cash-pooling arrangements for the Czech Republic, Hungary and Austria at the moment. There are a lot of questions about getting Poland into a cash pool – some say it is easy, some say it is not. Israel is very difficult, because it is a very different country with a very different banking environment.</p>
<p>In general terms, I don’t think it is particularly difficult. A key factor is identifying what is and is not legally permissible. Also, it is best to have cash pool arrangements with countries that have the same functional currency – otherwise you create more hedging problems for yourself by creating the wrong group. The other issue is withholding tax on the cross-border flows, which makes Italy a particularly difficult country to integrate.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-select-the-banks-in-all-these-places">How do you select the banks in all these places?</h5>
<p>Since the creation of the European treasury, we have acted to reduce the numbers of banks considerably. We want to have ten to twelve main banking relationships in Europe. Although this sounds quite a lot, given our geographical spread it is necessary. We wish those banks to make a lending commitment to Flextronics and, in return, we feel we have enough business to offer to satisfy this number of banks. We don’t want dormant sleeper relationships or relationships that are not fulfilled on both sides.</p>
<p>When selecting banks, we look for regional capability and then at the bank’s own strategic interests. For example, it wouldn’t be worthwhile asking an Austrian bank to help us in the Nordics as it wouldn’t fit their strategic remit. Initially we look for local expertise, but we don’t typically look at very local banks – we still look at major money centre banks that can offer a more pan-European solution.</p>
<h5 id="how-important-is-input-from-the-local-units">How important is input from the local units?</h5>
<p>We always listen to the local business function, but in our business local requirements are very minimal – usually not much more than salary runs and a few local payments. As long as the central group is getting the pricing and the servicing it wants and the local entity is getting the few local services it requires, it is much more of a pan-European choice.</p>
<h5 id="what-about-the-relationship-between-you-and-the-hq-in-san-jose-how-much-freedom-do-you-have">What about the relationship between you and the HQ in San José, how much freedom do you have?</h5>
<p>The establishment of the European treasury centre is really a European objective, so we have a fair amount of freedom. We still take long-term strategic money from the parent, typically because the senior lines have been previously established in the United States, and we keep the US advised on what is happening. Although they will comment from time to time on different pricing strategies and structures, the US has a fairly large remit to cover with our Brazilian and Mexican operations and so we have been left fairly much to our own devices in terms of establishing the treasury centre.</p>
<h5 id="as-someone-who-is-involved-in-the-area-how-do-you-see-it">The banks have been making big statements about moving into central and Eastern Europe. As someone who is involved in the area, how do you see it?</h5>
<p>I think it is a mixture. Big banks are buying up small local banks, but I am not currently convinced that they can currently offer the types of services that big companies want, especially outside Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. For example, I think that linking Romania through their connections to a Western European bank is still going to be very difficult. Throughout central and Eastern Europe, there are still significant tax, regulatory and governmental issues for a treasurer to overcome.</p>
<p>Ask your bank about the detail of their presence in central and Eastern European countries. If they tell you that they have a partner bank or they have just purchased a local bank, look very carefully at the degree of control that your bank has over that local presence to make sure that it is really a part of their bank rather than simply a result of their effort to make an acquisition in that country before a competitor.</p>
<p>As these countries want to become members of the European Union, they will lose some of the competitive advantage as labour costs will increase (which is one of the reasons that we are there). At the same time, they will have to change their governmental law structure and their civil code structure to adequately reflect the EU’s requirements, reducing the tax, regulatory and governmental barriers that I referred to above.</p>
<h5 id="is-it-true-to-say-that-what-you-can-get-in-western-europe-you-can-get-in-eastern-europe">The banks sometimes give the impression that Europe can be treated as a single entity. Is it true to say that what you can get in Western Europe, you can get in Eastern Europe?</h5>
<p>Not yet, not at the moment. At the moment, the big banks that are in central and Eastern Europe can provide a lot of good advice, however they still tend to sell a concept of a larger, expanded Europe being a lot simpler than it actually is. It is also a mistake to treat Western Europe as a single entity.</p>
<p>In Flextronics, we team up one of our developing countries with one of our existing countries – for example, Austria is in partnership with Hungary, the Czech Republic with Ireland, and Poland is with Sweden. We use the existing country expertise to develop on a more individual, mentoring basis. To seek one solution for Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, would be to forget that these countries are very different, with three different cultures and at very different stages of development over a range of subjects. I think it is a much safer to treat each country individually – our system of country partnerships helps to facilitate that.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-the-important-technology-issues-in-eastern-europe">In Western Europe, there is an increasing focus on the benefits of technology for the treasurer. What are the important technology issues in Eastern Europe?</h5>
<p>One of the things that people are focussing on first is cash management and cash pooling. When you include one of the old eastern European countries in a cash pool, you do need to know that (a) you can get the money out, that (b) it can be pooled at either a notional or zero balanced level and that (c) you are not going to be penalised for moving payments across borders. Security and the movement of money flows are your two prime objectives. Beyond that, some of the technological enhancements that some of the banks claim are an advantage are not that important at this stage.</p>
<h5 id="what-other-advice-do-you-have-for-businesses-moving-into-eastern-europe">What other advice do you have for businesses moving into Eastern Europe?</h5>
<p>Depending on your industry, you need to be very aware that when you are expanding into countries that are not typically western European (from a banking or financial perspective), you do have to rely on a lot of local expertise and a lot of local flexibility. Recognise that it is very difficult to impose centralised control on units in these countries. Concentrate on the key concepts, such as getting control of the cash, and don’t make any unnecessarily cumbersome procedures. Where it makes sense to keep things handled locally, leave them because they can be performed much better there.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>In the View from the Top series, we usually interview a senior treasurer but in this month’s issue, we are interviewing a banker, Tim Ritchie of Barclays Capital, who is also chairman of the Loan Markets Association in London. The reason for this is simple. All treasurers need to arrange funding from time to time and when negotiating with another party, it is easier to reach a mutually beneficial agreement if you have an understanding of the other party’s needs.</p>

<p>Banks’ risk management strategies are under scrutiny from their regulators, both nationally and internationally. The most recent pressure comes from the Bank of International Settlements in Basel, which has proposed a series of changes to the way in banks allocate capital. Under the current regime, banks are required to have capital ratios of 8% to cover the possibility of default and to protect the banks against failure. Essentially, this means that for every £100 lent, the bank had to have capital (or equity) of £8.</p>
<p>As risk management has become more sophisticated, banks have become more able to differentiate between the risks of default by different borrowers. The banks argue that lending to a strong credit should need less capital than lending to a more risky customer. The Basel proposals reflect this and it is increasingly likely that whilst stronger credits may have to pay relatively less for their borrowing, weaker credits may well have to pay more. This interview with Tim Ritchie explains some of the reasons why.</p>
<h5 id="can-you-outline-what-the-loan-market-association-is">Can you outline what the Loan Market Association is?</h5>
<p>The LMA was formed in late 1996. Initially, our main aim was to create a firm foundation, in terms of both documentation and market practices, on which a viable European secondary loan market could be established. Since then, our horizons have broadened and the LMA is now the trade association for lenders in the Euromarkets, covering a range of issues, both primary and secondary. The timing of the formation of the LMA was a key factor, since demands on the market have grown dramatically in the intervening period, and, as a result, the question of how to raise the quantum of liquidity required by clients has become a much more crucial issue than it used to be. We have endeavoured to build and maintain a dialogue with the borrower community on topics such as transferability, which are still somewhat emotive, but I believe that most borrowers now recognise that transferability has its positive aspects, in an environment where banks are more concerned about managing their asset base more dynamically, and particularly where borrower requirements exceed the capacity to lend of established relationship banks.</p>
<h5 id="are-corporates-distinguishing-between-megadeals-and-general-financing">Are corporates distinguishing between megadeals and general financing?</h5>
<p>Yes, I think they are. Of course, what is an unusually large transaction for one client might not be for another. This may not be anything to do with the scale of the borrower itself, but might reflect more the number and scope of the respective banking relationships, usually based upon historical needs. Certainly, clients are, for the most part, less concerned with who is providing the funds for a large acquisition than they are with obtaining the financing on attractive terms, or, for that matter, who is part of their core liquidity facility.</p>
<h5 id="does-the-lma-concentrate-on-the-secondary-market">Does the LMA concentrate on the secondary market?</h5>
<p>Not exclusively; we are looking at an increasingly wide range of issues, which are relevant in both a primary and a secondary context. For example, working with the ACT and the BBA, we have produced a standard form primary loan document for use under English Law. We believed that loan documentation has suffered from unnecessary over-customisation for some time. Although things were referred to as boilerplate, there was in truth no accepted standard; we have addressed this through our document.</p>
<p>The English Law document has become the reference point for the negotiation of most of the syndicated lending activity, which is taking place today. With boilerplate items reduced to standards, there is more time left to tackle the aspects of documentation, for example covenants, which need to be tailored to individual circumstances.</p>
<h5 id="how-will-the-proposals-affect-the-loan-market">Can we talk about the new Basel proposals? How will the proposals affect the loan market?</h5>
<p>From a wholesale lending perspective, the biggest change in the proposals is the closer alignment of regulatory capital requirements with economic capital consumption. The existing regime does little to encourage bankers when pricing loans to be sensitive to the real risk of the underlying counterparty.</p>
<p>Most major banks will be anticipating applying an internal ratingsbased model. It is likely that, as you go down the risk spectrum, the smaller increments in capital required under the standard model will be dwarfed by much greater increases in capital requirements under an internal ratings-based model. This will lead to price decompression in the market. This has, in any case, been developing for several years as banks have generally begun to apply more sophisticated analytics to their lending activity.</p>
<h5 id="is-allowing-the-banks-to-do-what-they-want-to-do-or-is-it-a-case-of-driving-them-to-do-something-they-wouldnt-have-done-otherwise">Are you saying that the new accord, whenever it is implemented, is allowing the banks to do what they want to do or is it a case of driving them to do something they wouldn’t have done otherwise?</h5>
<p>In terms of loan pricing, it encourages trends, which are already evident in many areas of the market, though not all. It is likely to serve as a catalyst and accelerate changes, which are already underway.</p>
<h5 id="do-you-see-that-being-an-issue">The first accord was very straightforward – 8% minimum capital requirement – the new one seems much more complex. It requires regulators in different countries to apply it. Do you see that being an issue?</h5>
<p>It could be, depending ultimately upon the degree of control delegated to local regulators and the way in which they use it. The LMA wants to see the playing field as level as possible and our response to the Basel proposals highlights this potential issue.</p>
<h5 id="will-banks-themselves-approach-their-decision-making-any-differently">Will banks themselves approach their decision-making any differently?</h5>
<p>Changes are already taking place. Many banks have a more centralised approach to pricing loans than was once the case. Some have introduced portfolio management techniques and many are actively looking at this discipline, which is relatively new to lending, with a view to implementation in the near future. Those making pricing and other decisions are better informed than ever about relative value and thus more aware of any opportunity cost of lending. Hence there is a heightened focus on the levels of ancillary business available to complement lending relationships. Relationship managers within banks are still involved in the decisions and are responsible for building the business case for lending, but, in many instances, no longer have a free rein to price loans to acceptable credits as was once the case.</p>
<h5 id="might-a-relationship-bank-now-turn-round-to-a-company-and-say-no-we-wont-give-you-a-loan">Might a relationship bank now turn round to a company and say no, we won’t give you a loan?</h5>
<p>Quite conceivably. Banks are increasingly evaluating relationships across a broader front of product delivery and potential. Lending is most frequently the platform upon which the relationship is built. Each new lending opportunity gives the banker a chance to reassess the relationship from both a risk and reward perspective. In many instances, relationships have not developed as had originally been hoped and bankers are becoming much more disciplined in the way in which they measure returns and are showing less and less tolerance for perpetuating unprofitable relationships.</p>
<p>That said, there is still plenty of competition for clients’ overall business in Europe and there are quite a number of banks which are aggressively leveraging their lending capacity to gain access to other product opportunities. With markets in Europe still developing, this should continue to be the case for some time to come.</p>
<h5 id="will-the-stronger-corporates-start-to-question-your-charges-because-of-basel-ii">Will the stronger corporates start to question your charges because of Basel II?</h5>
<p>It is all very well modelling risk and return, but ultimately supply and demand factors in the market will be the major determinant of pricing levels. Overall, I anticipate that less-risky borrowers will expect to get a better deal relative to their riskier counterparts and I doubt that they will be disappointed.</p>
<h5 id="is-there-any-possibility-that-more-of-the-funding-that-is-done-in-the-capital-markets-will-come-back-to-the-banking-sector-because-of-the-weightings-that-would-be-applied">Is there any possibility that more of the funding that is done in the capital markets will come back to the banking sector because of the weightings that would be applied?</h5>
<p>Given the way that the capital markets are growing in Europe and given the commitment that major banks, as well as institutional investors, have made to their further development, I very much doubt it. While bank financing will continue to be required for working capital purposes and will often provide either a bridge to the capital markets or the liquidity insurance required for short term issuance of, for example, Commercial Paper, I don’t think the Basel proposals will slow down the trend which is generally seeing an increasingly large proportion of permanent funding requirements of European clients successfully met in the capital markets.</p>
<h5 id="if-you-are-the-lead-bank-selling-the-loan-on-how-will-this-work">At the margin, the ratings could be split. If you are the lead bank selling the loan on, how will this work?</h5>
<p>The market already deals with split ratings in situations where ratings grids are deployed. I don’t foresee any problems here. I do expect an increasing incidence of ratings grids in Europe, which will provide the framework for pricing to develop under Basel II, making synchronisation of individual bank models a moot point.</p>
<h5 id="how-competitive-the-market-will-be-for-the-various-levels-of-rated-business">One of the key questions is how competitive the market will be for the various levels of rated business?</h5>
<p>I think the absolute levels of risk appetite in the market will continue to be largely cyclical and broadly in line with levels of economic activity. To the extent that lenders can get paid more fairly for taking an increasing amount of risk then one would expect increased appetite to develop. For example, the European leveraged loan market will continue to expand. The LMA has been very supportive of efforts to attract new institutional investors to this part of the loan market, and has lobbied successfully for various tax disincentives to be removed, so as to deepen the available liquidity for clients and enable larger financings to be executed.</p>
<p>As I noted earlier, lending activity will increasingly be targeted as part of a suite of solutions and products, so the Basel weightings in themselves are unlikely to drive banks’ business plans in isolation.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>We continue our popular series of interviews with senior figures in the world of treasury and finance, this month talking to Neil Cotter, Group Treasurer, Logica plc.</p>
<div class="biography right">
<div class="vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Neil Cotter</h4>
<h5 class="title">Group Treasurer</h5>
<img alt="Logica plc" class="logo org" height="43" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/logica-logo-2001-80x43.png" width="80"/>

</div>
<h5 id="how-do-you-manage-your-cash">How do you manage your cash?</h5>
<p>I see three elements to cash management.</p>
<p>Firstly all permanent large cash balances should be deposited with central treasury – after all that is where the investment skill base resides. It is my job to make sure the businesses realise that the centre is the "bank of first resort" to them rather than their local bank. It is critical that we act as a professional banking service to our businesses to minimise local concerns over access to cash. The end result is that we can maximise investment returns whilst minimising counterparty risk.</p>
<p>The second element is that the day-to-day balances – the working capital balances – operate via a cash pool in each country. We try to have a single bank, wherever possible, to run a particular country’s cash pooling operation.</p>
<p>The third element is to have an overlay banking structure. The overlay bank is there to extract surplus balances from the country cash pools on a day-to-day basis and bring it back to the UK effectively maximising the centralising of the cash on a daily basis.</p>
<p>I think these are the three elements which are standard for most treasuries, but we need to keep things in perspective since the first element is by far the most important.</p>
<h5 id="how-did-you-go-about-setting-up-the-cash-management-structure">How did you go about setting up the cash management structure? Do you have local treasurers?</h5>
<p>We have treasury professionals in Ireland and the Far East – elsewhere the job is performed by the general finance function. I have to promote the concept that cash flow and working capital should be managed locally, but that cash management is the prerogative of the central treasury function. It is a matter of repeating this message again and again and being clear that it is the best way forward.</p>
<p>We haven’t actually implemented the overlay bank yet – that will happen quite shortly as we have been going through a selection process over the last few months. But it all takes time, with all the bank accounts and processes that need to be set up.</p>
<h5 id="what-do-you-do-with-your-cash-surpluses">What do you do with your cash surpluses?</h5>
<p>Apart from a couple of minor periods after paying cash for acquisitions, Logica has been net cash positive for the last five years or so. In particular, we have had a lot of surplus cash recently. Our rights issue in October 2000 raised £460m of cash, mainly to pay for an acquisition, which completed in July this year. Being used to having £40m or £50m cash and then suddenly having £500m cash was a major issue.</p>
<p>With a rights issue, almost all the cash comes in over one or two days. We had to distribute that cash rapidly – to maximise returns and manage counterparty risk. Logica is very conservative on counterparty risk with strict limits. We never put more than £50m with one entity and that’s only when it has a AA+ rating or better. If it’s between AA- and AA+ then the limit is £25m. If it’s below AA- we don’t invest.</p>
<p>I put over 80% of that money into CP or CDs to enhance the return and this achieved a 10 or 15 basis point enhancement relative to bank deposits. I also managed to find a bank that, for some reason, offered base plus five basis points on a 7 day notice bank account – which was good because one week LIBOR has averaged about 10 basis points below base for some time. We are ruthlessly opportunistic within our counterparty risk framework.</p>
<h5 id="what-cp-market-did-you-go-for">What CP market did you go for?</h5>
<p>We invested in sterling denominated Euro CP because we benchmark our returns against sterling (since the cash was transient) and other currency denominated CP didn’t generate a higher return than sterling CP on an afterswap basis. I also managed to find banks that would act as custodian on the paper, so I didn’t need to open a Euroclear or Cedel account. This was helpful as the long cash position was only for 6 months or so.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-raise-funds-to-finance-your-continuing-expansion">How do you raise funds to finance your continuing expansion?</h5>
<p>Logica adopts a very conservative approach to debt and, as I have said, has been net cash for several years, apart from some short periods. Generally speaking those short periods have been due to timing differences between when we can access equity markets and paying for acquisitions. There are no short or long-term borrowings although we do have a £150m bank facility that remains undrawn at the moment. This facility is primarily to fund minor acquisitions and to help bridge the gap between raising equity and paying for acquisitions so markets can be tapped optimally.</p>
<p>The rights issue in October 2000 was a deep discounted rights issue (DDR). A typical rights issue used to be at a 10% to 15% discount to the share price. The company would pay underwriters to buy the shares if the share price dropped below the discounted price – effectively a very expensive put option on the company’s own shares. Since the stock market has recently exhibited high volatility, underwriting fees on rights issues with a 15% discount would be heavy. We therefore agreed to do a rights issue at a 50% discount to the prevailing share price. This meant that instead of paying something like a 2% underwriting fee, we only paid ½ % underwriting fee – a saving of £7m. The only problem with a rights issue is that you have to produce a detailed document which is time consuming compared with a non pre-emptive equity placement. It is interesting to note that DDRs have rapidly become the market norm for raising significant equity.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-arrange-project-finance">How do you arrange project finance?</h5>
<p>Part of Logica’s growth stems from Design, Build, Finance, Operate (DBFO) projects. For example, we have a contract with OFSTED, which involves developing software and infrastructure, and then running it, primarily so their staff can work from home.</p>
<p>Customers often want us to pay for all the development costs and then they wish to pay us over the life of the project in the form of an operating license. This gives us significant negative cash flow on those projects in the early years. The problem with these contracts is that the stock market sees the negative cash flow and it gets concerned – businesses are at the end of the day measured on cash flow. In effect, Logica is acting as a bank to the customer – that is, financing the customer’s capital expenditure. In this case (OFSTED) it is a very good quality customer – the government with its AAA rating – so there are no credit concerns but we still have the cashflow issue.</p>
<p>But Logica is not a bank and we have no aspiration to be one! These projects need to be structured so that we can show the stock market that, although we have got working capital building up on these projects, there really is no financial counterparty risk on Logica – we will still be paid (other than us not performing on the contract which is an inbuilt risk of Logica). Our solution is to enter into contracts with banks where we sell the future receivables under these projects to the bank. They provide cash up front and, in return, they obtain a stream of payments direct from the customer. It is like factoring except that the debt hasn’t happened yet – although we have incurred the expense. The bank does not have recourse to Logica in respect of customer credit default. We have effectively ring fenced the debt and the working capital, which, under accounting standard FRS5, are shown together on the balance sheet. We like this structure because it clearly shows working capital post non-recourse financing – a much truer measure of Logica’s working capital management. This also means that we can avoid complex project finance structures as well – it keeps it simple and cheap. At the end of June, the OFSTED project was the first to be drawn. But if we are going to do a significant amount of DBFO work, this will be our preferred route to mitigate counterparty risk on the commercial side of the business.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-manage-your-currency-risk">How do you manage your currency risk?</h5>
<p>We hedge 100% on trade receivables and payables. A big risk at Logica is the contingent foreign exchange risk on projects where the UK business might bid for a contract in a foreign currency. When we bid for the contract, we don’t know whether we are going to win or lose the contract. There are instruments that allow this risk to be effectively hedged. Obviously when we win a contract we will enter into a forward contract to protect the risk. I would then guarantee that exchange rate to the project manager who then has to manage the project. I make sure that I net out to zero at the centre – and perhaps show a small profit!</p>
<p>We also manage the foreign exchange risk on all the debt that comes into the centre. If we need to hedge a euro exposure, it is inefficient to borrow in euros (because we are net cash remember) and to deposit in sterling because we are paying a 45 basis point borrowing margin on the euros. We do it synthetically by replicating the scenario of borrowing euros and depositing sterling by entering into an outright forward foreign exchange contract. Effectively the forward points on the contract represent the interest differential on the two currencies.</p>
<p>A similar technique is used to create synthetic debt in Euros and USD to hedge our overseas investments. Residual tax risks can exist on currency debt but these can be mitigated through simple FX derivatives or tax matching elections. The relevant interest rates drive which is the best the option to use.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-use-technology-within-your-treasury">How do you use technology within your treasury?</h5>
<p>As treasurer of a technology firm, Logica, I feel it incumbent upon myself to utilise new technologies or at least investigate new technologies on behalf of all treasurers. I’m particularly interested in two areas which will facilitate improved straight through processing for mid-sized corporates:</p>
<p>Firstly, I’m looking at a product called ConCord, produced by CityNetworks. This product allows me to transact foreign exchange and money markets directly with my banks. As ConCord is a service that gives me access to the SWIFT network, this will send a SWIFT message on my behalf to match with the SWIFT message send by the bank. At the moment, corporates such as ourselves are not able to do this as they are not part of the SWIFT network. This will create a system where the treasurer can electronically match the confirmations contemporaneously with transaction execution. It interested me in particular as it deals with money markets as well as FX.</p>
<p>Secondly I am interested in the multibank FX portals such as FXall and Currenex. Ideally what I would like is for all my banks to quote through a single window. I don’t want individual interfaces to each bank with 8 user IDs, 8 passwords and 8 individual links from their systems into my system. It doesn’t lend itself to enabling straight through processing. What we really need is a single window into the banking market for all the financial instruments. The treasurer then has a single source of data that would be able to interact with his treasury system. I am convinced that, given time, this will be the main route for procuring over-the-counter financial instruments.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-approach-your-banking-relationships">How do you approach your banking relationships?</h5>
<p>We are very focussed on relationship banking. We give our banking business to those banks that provide us with their balance sheet albeit our bank facility is undrawn. There is a general trend for many banks to reduce their exposure to technology firms at the moment and because we are in the same sector, it will inevitably impinge on some relationships despite us being cash generative and carrying no debt!</p>
<h5 id="how-many-banks-do-you-have">How many banks do you have?</h5>
<p>Ten. We operate a two-tier system. We have an inner tier of five banks with whom we do most of our business and who provide the major element of syndicated finance. With the next five in the outer tier, the relationship is weaker. This is a twoway street – because we don’t do that much business with them, they don’t provide much of their balance sheet to us.</p>
<p>We are looking for banks with aspirations to match the global footprint that we are developing. Our relationship banks must also have the capability to fulfil some of the requirements we need at the centre – the project finance, foreign exchange and money market activity. At the moment we are in the process of reassessing our inner tier of banks to make it fit better with Logica’s requirements – we have developed in Germany and we may well expand in the USA.</p>
<h5 id="you-have-treasurers-in-ireland-and-japan-who-appoints-the-local-banks">You have treasurers in Ireland and Japan – who appoints the local banks?</h5>
<p>I specify with whom they can bank. In some corporates they want to keep treasury separate in each business stream. However, Logica is a global integrated brand so, likewise, I want to centralise treasury activity. Wherever possible, I want to internalise transactions, so that I can net them prior to execution. There are also compelling control reasons to adopt this policy irrespective of a particular corporate’s business philosophy.</p>
<p>It is important that the local businesses deal with the banks with whom I have a central relationships, for three reasons. If things go wrong locally, I can bring central pressure to bear to sort it out. Secondly it also enables me to exercise some control from the centre. If there are some unusual transactions locally, my relationship banker can tell me, and I can investigate. Most of the time there will be no problem – but it is an extra control or comfort factor. Thirdly the bank can advise me if there are better ways of managing the local transactions.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-see-the-banking-sector-developing">How do you see the banking sector developing?</h5>
<p>I think that many banks want to make more and more money from investment banking. Instead of offering bank credit they want to help us issue bonds, for example, despite not having a requirement to do so. This can be irritating – they are all chasing the cream but unfortunately there is very little to go round. Most corporates have a limited budget for investment banking. The relationships are also changing on asset finance – banks are looking to move from unsecured credit risk to lending against assets but this actually fits in neatly with our customer requirement for us to fund them – a happy coalescence for once! All in all this seems to be where things are heading.</p>
<p>The problem for corporates is that it will become harder to access unsecured syndicated loan financing. Corporates will have to be flexible and be prepared to tap into other investor bases such as bond issues and private placements, even if they have to be pay up heavily for the diversification. There is, however, an element of wait and see about this. We have to recognise that the dynamics of what the banks are looking for can change rapidly. Corporates have to be more flexible in the way they approach their relationship banks and recognise that the "fair weather" bank is back with a vengeance.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>We continue our popular series of interviews with senior figures in the world of treasury and finance, this month talking to Giuseppe Matassi, European Treasurer, Johnson Controls Inc.</p>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Giuseppe Matassi</h4>
<h5 class="title">European Treasurer</h5>
<img alt="Johnson Controls" class="logo org" height="39" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/johnson-controls-logo-2013-90x39.png" width="90"/>
</div>
<h5 id="what-is-your-role-as-the-european-treasurer-in-an-american-company">What is your role as the European Treasurer in an American Company?</h5>
<p>Johnson Controls is a highly decentralised company. Treasury is becoming more consultancy, technology and investment banking driven rather than process-execution driven. As technological developments allow much more automation, this drives down treasury costs. We are therefore changing our focus to become a partner for our operational businesses. We will be advising our businesses during their operational decision-making on how best to, for example, move into emerging markets.</p>
<p>At the same time, risk management will become much more important as a role for the treasury. As an illustration, treasury will become central to more parts of the business during strategic planning. We will develop risk management strategies before those risks are taken on, rather than managing risks after changes have been implemented, as has been the case to date.</p>
<p>Technology has added, and will continue to add, more value to the business. By making execution and strategic hedging, for example, easier, treasury will have more time to provide advice to our operational businesses.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-your-relationship-with-the-corporate-treasurer-in-the-united-states">What is your relationship with the corporate treasurer in the United States?</h5>
<p>I report to the corporate treasurer. I am a member of the currency advisory board, which includes the chief financial officer, the corporate treasurer, the corporate controller and two divisional worldwide controllers.</p>
<p>Within the organisation, I head up one of the company’s four regional treasury centres. I am based in Brussels and have responsibility for treasury activity in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. The other three treasury centres are in Singapore, the United States and Brazil. As a treasury centre, we are working more closely with the operational side of the businesses, in the ways that I described earlier.</p>
<p>We are now operating as an in-house bank. Our plan is to integrate all the back office treasury functions here in Brussels.</p>
<p>As a result of advancements in technology, it is now possible to process treasury functions from a single, common database, accessible from remote location via the Johnson Controls network. The office in Brussels will be the worldwide back office hub for all the group’s treasury activities. By operating a single global database in this way, we will avoid duplicating unnecessary back office costs.</p>
<p>The corporate treasurer in the United States will continue to advise companies in the US and Latin America. In addition, he will set the strategy for treasury across the group, by looking at debt, derivatives and the other main aspects of treasury.</p>
<h5 id="why-did-johnson-controls-choose-to-establish-in-belgium-rather-than-for-example-in-switzerland-or-dublin">You operate as a Belgian Co-ordination Centre. Why did Johnson Controls choose to establish in Belgium rather than, for example, in Switzerland or Dublin?</h5>
<p>In 1991, the company faced a dilemma. Through a series of acquisitions, it had expanded into Europe. The company needed to decide whether to continue to use separate, incountry treasurers or whether to centralise European treasury operations in one place. We decided to centralise because we felt that the introduction of the single currency would reduce foreign exchange activity within Europe and would make the process of managing one pool of cash in Europe not only possible, but also relatively easy.</p>
<p>Having taken the decision to centralise, the next question we had to answer was where should we set up this centralised treasury? Realistically we could choose from a number of possible locations – Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Ireland. There were three determining factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Location.</h5>
<p>The treasury centre had to be easily accessible for our key business units. Transport from Dublin to some places is difficult, as it involves changing in London. Brussels, however, is central for our key European operations, which are sited in the United Kingdom, Germany and Spain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Language skills.</h5>
<p>When the decision was taken we felt that Belgium offered us a workforce with multilingual skills. Each member of my staff speaks at least three languages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h5>The tax advantage.</h5>
<p>At the time, there were also significant tax advantages for us to set up a Belgian Co-ordination Centre. However, as an American company, these advantages still apply, but have less positive impacts as we pay tax on the worldwide income and can elect for the "check the box" tax method. This highlights that companies should not take long-term decisions on the basis of tax advantages alone. These incentives will disappear over time (as they are doing now in Dublin). Tax rules will not last for the whole life of a corporation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of these factors, we decided to locate our European treasury centre in Brussels.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-approach-the-issue-of-the-use-of-technology">How do you approach the issue of the use of technology?</h5>
<p>We see technology as an enabler. It is not a cost that we have to reduce, rather we have to show that any investments we make in technology will lead to improvements in productivity. As an indication, the group’s turnover has doubled in the last five years from $8.3 billion to $17.2 billion. However the treasury team across the group is now the same size as it was five years ago. This shows that we have been successful in making the technology work for us.</p>
<p>We use technology to automate processes and to standardise. As an example, developments in commercial banking are using technology that will allow us to benefit from straight-through processing. Business units within the company want to know that using us will add value to their bottom line.</p>
<p>I have been discussing with a recent acquisition the benefits that they will get from using our in-house bank. They will want to see that by using us they will benefit from lower levels of processing and transaction costs than they would have been charged had they continued to use their commercial banks.</p>
<p>In the longer term, the group should benefit from the introduction of common processing. In this way, the use of technology allows us to free up resources to add value elsewhere. For example, as I have already discussed, we are able to spend more time providing advice to our business units.</p>
<h5 id="what-treasury-management-system-do-you-use">What treasury management system do you use?</h5>
<p>We have been continuously implementing Trema’s FinanceKIT. Our vision is that we will be running a central database in Europe that will be used to manage treasury activities globally. All our operations will be linked to the central database in Europe and the treasury will be able to be managed from anywhere in the world. We envisage the group’s treasury being run twenty-four hours a day – during the Asian day, from Singapore, then being taken over by Brussels and then Brussels handing over to the US, and so on.</p>
<p>That is our objective. That is not how we currently operate. We are still waiting for the upgrade from Trema that will allow us to operate the multitasking and the 24-hour management. This upgrade should come through in October. We will then need a period in which to fine-tune the system. We expect to be operating this global system early next year. We started this planning process in 1997. We selected Trema because we wanted a software developer that could share our vision and would be able to work with us to achieve our aims.</p>
<h5 id="what-role-do-you-see-for-the-treasury-centre-in-brazil">You talked about this treasury system being managed globally from Singapore, Brussels and the US. What role do you see for the treasury centre in Brazil?</h5>
<p>At the moment, Brazil’s infrastructure is not sufficiently developed to allow the treasury centre to be incorporated into Johnson Control’s global treasury management process. Neither the state of the telecoms sector nor the bandwidth available is sufficient to enable the Latin American treasury centre to be managed remotely. The level of regulation in Brazil makes this difficult as well. All these reasons mean that the integration of the Brazilian treasury centre is on hold until later.</p>
<p>This problem with technology exists elsewhere as well. For example, the level of technology available now in Romania is the same as that which was available in the Czech Republic in 1991. Our activities in Russia are also limited by the state of the technology. However, the volumes involved in these countries are not that large – as an indication, the group’s European turnover is about $4 billion, of which about $200m is from Russia. Although we cannot integrate all our businesses, we can put our vision into motion, and these countries can join as appropriate.</p>
<h5 id="what-role-do-you-see-technology-playing-in-the-future">What role do you see technology playing in the future?</h5>
<p>It has been argued that the Internet will change (and has changed) the face of the world. However on the question of security and connectivity, the Internet has not necessarily changed things at all. Firstly, one does not necessarily receive a better quote from Internet-based trading systems. When seeking quotes on the phone, I don’t pay a fee, I simply pay the cost of communication through a connection cost. I shouldn’t pay to use an e-dealing service, because they don’t change anything. I still need quotes from, say, three banks. Once I have the quotes, I then have to push the button and get the confirmation. For multibank services such as Currenex and FXall, the banks should pay – not the company. Having said that, there are some benefits from straight-through processing.</p>
<p>I do see future benefits from the Internet in that it will allow me as a treasurer to deal directly with a treasurer from another company in another country. For example, I might be able to arrange a swap directly with another company, rather than through a bank. If this happens, the role of the bank will then shift from being the provider of the service to being the guarantor of liquidity.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>We continue our popular series of interviews with senior figures in the world of treasury and finance, this month talking to Kim Holdsworth, Group Treasurer, BAA.</p>
<div class="biography right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Kim Holdsworth</h4>
<h5 class="title">Group Treasurer</h5>
<img alt="BAA" class="logo org" height="21" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/baa-logo-2001-70x21.png" width="70"/>
</div>
<h5 id="how-do-you-deal-with-those-cash-surpluses">BAA has a series of very long term investments in infrastructure, which is one side of the business. The other side of the business is cash generation via the retail side at the airports. How do you deal with those cash surpluses?</h5>
<p>Overall we are net borrowers, with debt of approx £2 billion. However we are in a seasonal business and we do fund ourselves opportunistically, hence we have about £330m within treasury that we are managing at the moment. The bank accounts in the UK sweep to one of two main bank accounts, one at Barclays and another at NatWest. I have, a cash manager and a dealer who look at the cash position each morning, concentrate the funds into one bank account and then invest the balance.</p>
<p>We are a very prudent company and we have strict board-approved mandates. We invest surplus cash in money market deposits with investment grade banks for up to one year, AAA rated money funds or commercial paper. We were one of the early users in the UK of Sterling money funds, having seen them work effectively in the US. The majority of our investments are in commercial paper rated A1/P1. We do not invest in equities or bonds.</p>
<p>The Group’s cash flow forecasts are not detailed on a week-by-week basis or even month-by-month. As a significant amount of our cash outflow is capital expenditure related, it proves difficult to accurately predict the level of payments on a weekly basis. Within treasury we look at the budget each year and identify what is budgeted for the annual net debt movement. We get a feel for how long our cash will last, taking into account the cyclical flow of cash throughout the year and the knowledge we have of the group’s payment history. We tend to invest out to known requirement dates – to cover dividend payments, to cover bond payments. When we have covered all those dates, we are looking for yield pick up.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-you-looking-for-from-your-banking-relationships">What are you looking for from your banking relationships?</h5>
<p>A couple of years ago we formalised internally our relationships with our banks. Every year the board is asked to confirm the group’s core banks based on my recommendations. At the moment, we have six core banks, which serve all our requirements – capital markets, day-to-day clearing business, the credit card business, advisory work. We also have a second tier of banks that have committed funds to BAA under a syndicated bank facility.</p>
<p>When we have new business, we look at the banks that have been prepared to put up their balance sheet for BAA. As the banks are now under pressure to make higher returns on their assets, we look to give our business to our six core banks, provided they have the required core competencies. Thereafter we will give business to those banks that have committed funds to us on our syndication.</p>
<p>We want banks that actually understand our business. As a company, BAA is quite unique. I don’t mind which sector a bank puts us in – eg transport, retail or utility – as long as they understand the business and we don’t waste each other’s time.</p>
<h5 id="do-you-evaluate-your-bank-relationships-from-scratch">Do you evaluate your bank relationships from scratch?</h5>
<p>It isn’t that formal. I did think about going through an official audit process, but I decided not to. The evaluation of a bank’s performance is based more on my own personal fee the views of the rest of the Treasury team and the level of service our subsidiaries are receiving from the banks.</p>
<h5 id="how-has-that-affected-your-view">There has been a lot of merger activity within the banking sector. How has that affected your view?</h5>
<p>With the global merger activity, some banks have changed their own focus. Some banks have moved towards investment banking and are not prepared now to do some of the day-to-day business such as letters of credit. Banks will be quite blatant in that they require rates of return. Unless we give them business, they cannot give us services. This change has meant our core group of banks has needed to be strengthened. Last year we added a sixth bank to the core group in anticipation of refinancing requirements.</p>
<h5 id="cp-programme-how-does-it-work">I see you have a CP programme. How does it work?</h5>
<p>We have two. We have a Sterling CP programme that has been dormant since1996, when we started to raise funds opportunistically in the bond market. Although we haven’t used this programme in a while, we have a large funding requirement in the next five years and I anticipate reactivating this programme.</p>
<p>We also have a USCP programme that was set up in 1997 and is active. There is only about $200m outstanding and that is used to hedge the Group’s dollar assets. When we acquired World Duty Free America, we hedged that investment using US dollar debt. When our US subsidiaries need to raise capital, group treasury raises the debt centrally via the USCP market.</p>
<p>We have looked at setting up an ECP programme and we will probably replace the Sterling CP with an ECP programme, when we come to refinance our backup facility at the end of next year. At the moment, our facility cannot be used as backup for an ECP programme because the notice period for non-sterling draw downs is four days.</p>
<h5 id="have-you-started-to-talk-to-people-about-arranging-that">Have you started to talk to people about arranging that?</h5>
<p>No – that will be next year. Our first project this financial year will be to set up an EMTN programme.</p>
<h5 id="when-did-you-start-doing-that">When did you start doing that?</h5>
<p>The invites for an arranger were sent out last month. We held presentations over two days and appointed an arranger for our EMTN programme shortly after. The plan is that the documentation will be finalised by the end of July, with the hope that we will be posting opportunistic funding rates in the autumn.</p>
<h5 id="how-many-invites-have-you-sent-out">How many invites have you sent out?</h5>
<p>We sent out six.</p>
<h5 id="are-those-your-core-group-of-six-banks">Are those your core group of six banks?</h5>
<p>Yes. The core group has the competencies. That’s what are core group is about. Our bankers need to be able to fulfil our needs now but also our needs in perhaps two or three years time.</p>
<h5 id="on-risk-management-you-dont-appear-to-have-too-much-in-the-way-of-currency-risk">On risk management, you don’t appear to have too much in the way of currency risk.</h5>
<p>Hardly any whatsoever. The majority of the business is Sterling based. We invoice in Sterling and we get paid Sterling, although there are exceptions. Occasionally we buy products, which tend to be for capital expenditure, in Euro or dollars. If the exposures are material, we would hedge them by buying currency forward. When we occasionally invest overseas, we hedge by borrowing in the same currency in which the asset is denominated.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-go-about-achieving-that">So the main risk that you have to manage is interest rate risk. I see that you have a target of between 60% and 80% fixed rate debt. How do you go about achieving that?</h5>
<p>Due to our credit ratings, we tend to fund ourselves where it is most efficient, which tends to be the bond market. Historically we haven’t overlaid many swaps onto this fixed rate debt. This practice means that we have a high level of fixed rate debt. We have transacted a number of plain vanilla swaps to try to reduce the fixed rate debt. As it stands today, we are above the preferred maximum limit, with about 83% fixed rate debt.</p>
<p>Historically, we have also borrowed fixed debt from the European Investment Bank, who have lent to us over many years. However the last two drawings were taken as floating. Once we have set up the EMTN programme, there will be opportunities when we will take floating rate debt.</p>
<p>Generally, we borrow fixed as we don’t want to borrow 30 year floating money to fund our long-term assets. We can then overlay the short end with a swap to turn it into floating.</p>
<h5 id="how-is-your-treasury-structured-who-does-what">How is your treasury structured? Who does what?</h5>
<p>There are four of us in a young team. We communicate well professionally and it helps that we personally get on extremely well too.</p>
<p>The junior member of the department is mainly concerned with dealing and monitoring the department’s accounting and budgeting. That is not the control side of treasury transactions – we’ll touch on that later.</p>
<p>The cash manager is responsible for l the daily cash management of the UK group and overseeing the cash managing in overseas subsidiaries. She monitors both the UK and the overseas accounts. She is also responsible for getting our dealing systems as high tech as possible and she is installing a new treasury management system at the moment.</p>
<p>My other treasury manager works on funding, foreign exchange and derivatives. He has other responsibilities as well – he will work on the EMTN documentation with me. He has also been preparing recommendations to hedge the Group’s exposure to employee share options.</p>
<p>I oversee the department and concentrate on the strategic management of the debt portfolio. I have to network and get out into the business and make sure that my internal customers are happy with the service they are receiving from Treasury. We have separated out the back office. Two people within the finance department are part-time treasury accountants. The deal matching and controls – eg the bank reconciliation – are performed outside treasury. The treasury accountants report daily into the group financial controller, with the reports copied to me. They are not under my control, but if there were any problems, I would know straight away. They also do the monthly accounting for the department.</p>
<p>Segregation of duties is important within BAA. For example, the structure of any derivative transaction has to be agreed in advance by the group finance director. Once he has approved the structure, either myself or my treasury Manager would agree and close the deal. When the EMTN programme is set up, we will have to revisit the delegated authorities.</p>
<h5 id="did-you-send-out-six-because-you-have-six-core-banks">Do you think that six is a good number to send out or did you send out six because you have six core banks?</h5>
<p>Time management was a factor. I wanted to have the presentations in one day. I think five or six is the right number to ensure that you complete a fair and proper tendering process and you see enough competition. Any more and you get too much information. It is possible that six is too high and it should have been four. However I want to be fair and I want our core banks to know that they are getting a fair chance for the business that BAA has to offer.</p>
<h5 id="how-are-you-measured-and-controlled-over-a-longer-period">How are you measured and controlled over a longer period?</h5>
<p>We are a cost centre, rather than a profit centre. I have my own department’s budget and I am responsible for the group’s interest charge. Each month the executive committee reviews the Group’s management accounts, of which treasury provides two pages. In these pages, we explain any differences in the interest cost to budget, any movement in net debt for the group and any movements in committed facilities. That is the formal reporting. I also have meetings with the group finance director at least twice a month.</p>
<h5 id="how-are-you-looking-to-use-technology">How are you looking to use technology?</h5>
<p>There are a number of areas. First of all we are upgrading our treasury management system – the old one we have is not satisfactory. We want to eliminate as far as possible the need to rekey data. We want to get as much information into the database of the new system so that reports can be produced automatically. We also want the system to be able to interface into the Oracle accounting system that the group uses. We wanted a treasury management system that is able to upload bank information, so that we can do bank reconciliation online. We want confirmation matching and our bank payment systems to interface as well.</p>
<p>We also want to make sure that the system that we have chosen has audit trails we require and will allow us to build in the controls that we want – eg segregation of duties</p>
<p>Moving onto bank systems, at the moment we take bank statements from three different systems – Barclays, NatWest and Bankers Trust in America [now part of Deutsche Bank]. We have been keen to move onto the next versions of these systems as soon as possible. We are now using Bankers Trust’s web-based system to look up our outstanding CP. We are looking to move onto the web system to make payments and to review bank statements. Initially, I was very nervous about web systems, but one of the reasons why I am keen to move towards this technology is that I know this is the way that the banks are moving and it will be cheaper to upgrade. Also, it will make it easier to relocate the Treasury department should we need to work in a disaster recovery situation. The web technology should mean that treasury can choose to be more mobile. For example, although cash management is done in London, recently whilst I was down in Heathrow, I could log on and authorise deals online.</p>
<h5 id="what-other-issues-do-you-see-as-important">What other issues do you see as important?</h5>
<p>Banks seem to be emphasising more and more the importance of relationships. This is coinciding with the consolidation in the banking market. I would be interested to learn how other corporates are responding to this stance. BAA has responded by choosing six core banks, that can deal with most of our day-to-day requirements.</p>
<p>Secondly I wonder how bank lending will develop. The implications of Basel will be important for us, particularly because BAA has a split rating – we have AA- with S&amp;P and A1 with Moody’s.</p>
<p>Finally It’s a challenge for us to ensure that we are satisfying our banks in allowing them to make adequate returns. We are a Group whose Treasury activities primarily focus on sterling cash management, a little FX and a large debt portfolio that is going to be growing significantly with our published capital expenditure programme.</p></div>

<div class="copy__body"><p>Charles Van Der Welle speaks to us about the treasury set-up at Carlton Communications, and the approaches the company takes with regard to cash and risk managment.</p>
<div class="people right vcard">
<h4 class="fn">Charles Van Der Welle</h4>
<h5 class="title">Group Treasurer</h5>
<img alt="Carlton Communications" class="logo org" height="30" src="http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/carlton-logo-2001-90x30.png" width="90"/>
</div>
<h5 id="can-i-start-by-asking-how-you-have-structured-your-treasury">Can I start by asking how you have structured your treasury?</h5>
<p>We are going through substantial change at the moment. In March, we sold Technicolor, a video duplication and motion picture film processing and distribution business, to Thomson Multimedia. This finished off a long programme of disposals as Carlton becomes a very focused media business. The treasury operation in the USA is being scaled back as a result from a team of five to one or two people. </p>
<p>In the UK, I have got two people working for me – an assistant treasurer and a treasury dealer. Carlton is now primarily UK based after the sale of a number of peripheral businesses. The main business of the group is through its television franchises, which we added to recently after the industry consolidation processes last year. Another significant part of the business is our joint venture with Granada, the pay television platform ONdigital, which is to be rebranded ITVdigital.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-the-specific-responsibilities-of-carltons-treasury">What are the specific responsibilities of Carlton’s treasury and how are they allocated amongst the team?</h5>
<p>The department is responsible for managing the group’s surplus cash, for funding the business in the short, medium and long terms and for managing the group’s interest rate and currency risks. In the USA the department is responsible for administering Delaware based companies, cash management and foreign exchange, and the 401K pension plan.</p>
<p>I’m responsible for managing the department as a whole and specifically funding, risk management and ad hoc projects. The treasury dealer and the assistant treasurer are responsible for the day-to-day cash management, foreign exchange and reporting.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-firstly-measure-and-secondly-manage-those-risks">One of the subjects we have been covering in the newsletter is the management of interest rate and currency risk. You have some significant interest rate risks – how do you firstly measure and secondly manage those risks?</h5>
<p>As a group, we face both interest rate and currency risks. We need to measure those, although they are fairly easy to establish. On the interest rate side, the risks result from our debt and cash positions, and cashflow projections which are reasonably predictable.</p>
<p>Now that we have disposed of Technicolor, our currency positions are significantly reduced. Although we do have exposure to programming costs in USD (US Dollars) and CHF (Swiss Francs) and we do make film library sales abroad, we are mainly a UK business operating in a UK environment. Any level of currency risk that we are running on a year-to-year basis is quite easy to establish through discussion and reporting through our subsidiary operations.</p>
<p>The structure of risk management is defined through board authorities agreed by the main Carlton board of directors. There are basically three tiers of authority which each type of potential treasury activity are grouped under according to the perceived level of risk:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Long term risks that could have a significant effect on the group, including long term financing. These need to go in front of the main board for approval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medium term risks, including most interest rate and currency derivatives, need to be approved by a treasury committee. The Treasury Committee consists of the Chief Executive, the Finance Director and 	myself and it has to make unanimous decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third tier of risk is much shorter term and less risky and requires the approval of either the Finance Director or myself.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="when-taking-risk-management-decisions-what-are-you-looking-for">When taking risk management decisions, what are you looking for?</h5>
<p>We operate as a cost centre but have a responsibility to manage interest rate and currency positions in a manner which reduces risk and cost. This is what I am primarily looking for. We are also very much of the view that doing nothing should be an active decision. I think that is important – it is just as much a decision as going out and actively covering a risk. We will not take a position simply because we like the look of an instrument. Rather it must have some relation to the underlying business and its exposures, which can be long term.</p>
<p>In terms of decision-making, it tends to be my job to analyse the financial risks that Carlton faces, discuss specific ideas with our bankers and then make appropriate recommendations either to the Finance Director, the Treasury Committee or the main board. The appropriate tier of management will discuss it and make a decision accordingly. If a decision is taken to go ahead and do something, then I will go out and cover those risks with our bankers.</p>
<h5 id="how-many-banks-would-you-approach-once-you-have-taken-the-decision-to-transact">How many banks would you approach once you have taken the decision to transact?</h5>
<p>It depends on the product. If we are doing something relatively straightforward such as swapping a bond issue from fixed into floating, I would approach the banks that support us in our credit facility. I would expect to get quotes within one basis point for something plain vanilla like that.</p>
<p>For something more complicated, we would tend to work very closely with two or maybe three banks. For example, we do have some very long dated swaps on our books. These tend to take many weeks to put together, during which time we will examine all the angles – for example does it match the underlying risk? We also consider how we will account for it, which is an area that is becoming more rigorous. We will also do some what-if analysis, or get the bank to do it for us. We will always look at the worst-case scenario before entering into an agreement. We will only take the decision to go ahead on a very long-dated contract once we are sure we are entirely comfortable with the position we are establishing. Having taken this decision, we would execute fairly quickly.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-you-looking-for-when-you-are-investing-your-surplus-cash">Moving onto cash management, what are you looking for when you are investing your surplus cash?</h5>
<p>We were one of the first corporates to adopt Money Market Funds, probably about four years ago. We like the funds because they are triple A rated, very easy to use, with high degrees of liquidity and safety, and give an acceptable rate of return on our cash.</p>
<p>Now that we have realised cash from the disposal of Technicolor, I am beginning to look at alternatives to Money Market Funds. Some banks are establishing tailored Money Market Funds, which would be unique to the investing company and based upon pre-agreed risk parameters. For example the fund may invest in A1/P1 commercial paper and bank deposits, taken from an agreed list of counterparties, and the fund may have a longer permitted duration than a traditional Money Market Fund. With good management the bank should achieve a slightly higher yield – perhaps 25 basis points more than Money Market Funds pay at the moment – but at the expense of some element of liquidity and a very marginal increase in risk.</p>
<h5 id="are-you-planning-to-draw-upon-those">On the financing side, you have both ECP and EMTN programmes in place, neither of which you have drawn upon yet. Are you planning to draw upon those?</h5>
<p>Not yet. We only signed off the EMTN programme in March so that’s very new. We haven’t issued anything under it yet, because the structure of the group has changed significantly and we are in the process of meeting with the ratings agencies at the moment – we are awaiting confirmation of our rating from them before we look to go ahead with anything.</p>
<p>Going forward we would look to use the EMTN programme in the two traditional ways that corporates utilise these programmes – as standard documentation for public bond issues (in £ and $ ) and also through the issuance of private placements which would open a new investor base for Carlton.</p>
<p>The company’s long-term strategy in financing is to fund through the capital markets, rather than through the banks. We tend to view the banks as providing bridging finance. We have a fairly small bank facility that we completed in April, a £300m credit facility from a syndicate of eleven banks, most of which have known us for many years. It is not the company’s intention to draw on that facility – it is very much a standby. We would use it to bridge a bolt-on acquisition for example.</p>
<p>The size of the facility is not large enough to support a major strategic initiative. If that happens then we would approach our bankers for a far larger facility that we would then use to make the acquisition with and then we would, within a reasonable time and subject to market conditions, look to refinance the majority of that bank facility through the capital markets, public issues and private placements and maybe reactivating the Euro Commercial Paper programme, which has remained dormant for a number of years, because we have either had cash or we have funded in lumps through bond issues.</p>
<h5 id="what-treasury-management-system-do-you-use">How do you use technology? What treasury management system do you use?</h5>
<p>We use Richmond. We selected that system a couple of years ago having conducted an extensive exercise of treasury system selection. It took us six months to select and then another three months to implement.</p>
<p>We have been very happy with Richmond. We also have the flexibility that if our treasury operations become more sophisticated, we have a system that can move with us. It is the basic things that we are most interested in – reporting positions, recording and generating reports for our accounting systems. Those were the key requirements of our system selection.</p>
<p>My hope is that this system will be appropriate for Carlton for a period of at least five years, but I can’t really see beyond that. Richmond tends to provide a good service for medium/large companies (eg) from 50<sup>th</sup> in the FTSE 100 to 350 in the FTSE – that’s their market. And it’s good value for money.</p>
<h5 id="how-about-your-electronic-banking-system">How about your electronic banking system?</h5>
<p>When we had more businesses, we spread our clearing banking business amongst three Clearers. We have just been through a tender process to select one bank that will bank all our businesses in the UK – HSBC won that business and technology was key in winning that. We felt that HSBC’s Hexagon system had the edge over the other banks’ systems – although it was really personal preference as functionality is similar.</p>
<p>We made our selection in February and we are in the process of implementation, which has given us the opportunity to ask pertinent questions of our subsidiaries. Not only have we negotiated a very good deal by combining our business together, it is also an opportunity to review processes – we can question whether we are doing things that we don’t really need to do and we can ensure that controls of the subsidiaries are standardised and appropriate.</p>
<h5 id="do-you-use-the-internet-at-all">Do you use the Internet at all?</h5>
<p>Not at this stage. For example, we are not conducting our foreign exchange transactions by going into an Internet site and trading in that manner. We like day to day contact with our banks. I could see that the Internet is very useful if you have a high number of low value transactions – but we are not in that position. We are only involved in a handful of transactions every week and feel that the personal contact with the banks helps the relationship with those banks.</p>
<h5 id="what-else-do-you-have-to-do">We have looked at the core treasury roles. What else do you have to do?</h5>
<p>A lot of my job involves ad hoc projects. For example it was agreed that part of the Technicolor sale consideration from Thomson Multimedia would be in the form of loan notes with up to 4 years maturity when really Carlton wanted to receive cash. The board had little expectation of being able to monetise these. With the assistance of advisors I managed to negotiate with Thomson and their advisors that the notes contained terms that could facilitate their subsequent sale. It was interesting to be in the shoes of the lender rather than the borrower for a change, a case of poacher turned gamekeeper. Once the form of the notes was agreed I was able, with the help of advisors, to negotiate the sale of $300m of the notes to a bank at an acceptable price. The whole process took nearly 3 months of my time but was very rewarding as I felt that this added value to the group by improving liquidity and reducing risk. This is just one example but there frequent ad hoc projects that arise.</p>
<p>Working in a smaller treasury but in a FTSE 100 company, I find my job very interesting because I have to be involved in all areas. I am probably a much more ‘hands on’ treasurer than some, particularly those in the very large companies.</p></div>

<h5 id="i-would-imagine-that-collecting-cash-is-a-very-important-part-of-the-group-treasurers-activity-in-a-company-such-as-legal-and-general">John, I would imagine that collecting cash is a very important part of the Group Treasurer’s activity in a company such as Legal &amp; General.</h5>
<p>Yes it is, but as cash collection is so critical in terms of our relationship with our customers, we ensure that our businesses employ the most efficient methods for collecting premiums themselves. For this reason, the collection process is not centralised in Group Treasury. Therefore, unlike retail organisations, such as high street stores, we do not have to worry about issues such as multi-location banking of receipts.</p>
<p>However, we do have to deal with larger than average transaction amounts with some exceptional peaks in volumes. It is important that our bankers can provide our businesses with the most efficient and straightforward means of collecting funds from our customers, so that these funds are available for investment asap. Remember, the majority of our business is the sale of investment and savings products to individuals. Where we do offer risk products we need to minimise the period between the creation of the policy with the customer being on risk and the receipt of the premium.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-you-looking-for-from-your-collections-process">In that context, what are you looking for from your collections process?</h5>
<p>As I have mentioned, the issue is for us to make it as easy as possible for our customers to complete an investment transaction. They need to be able to get their money to us quickly so that it is invested as soon as possible in accordance with their specific savings product requirements. Because investment products are generally sold not bought, the delivery of the customer’s funds to us is integral to each transaction.</p>
<p>In selling savings products, we need to focus on the efficiencies that can be made. We have to do more than just bank the cheque. We also need to be able to capture the customer’s personal information from, for example, their ISA application form. For this reason, we have ruled out a lockbox collection system, as, unless an imaging process is available to capture this information, we could encounter delays in correctly allocating receipts to customers’ accounts.</p>
<p>For most collections the thrust is to use the AUDDIS (automated direct debit) system of payments. We usually collect payments this way for any sale that comes in via the telephone or the Internet as well. We also offer debit card collection on the Internet. However, the response so far has not been particularly great.</p>
<h5 id="is-it-the-customers-reluctance-to-trust-the-net">Why do you think that is? Is it the customer’s reluctance to trust the net?</h5>
<p>I think that is probably one reason. People are still wary of security on the net. We still get a flood of cheques for ISA applications, which does cause some strain for our bankers. We have to ensure that the banks can cope with such peaks of activity – this means that local branches used at our business locations have to gear up their staffing levels accordingly.</p>
<h5 id="does-this-work-as-efficiently-as-is-reasonable-or-as-efficiently-as-you-would-like">Does this work as efficiently as is reasonable or as efficiently as you would like?</h5>
<p>It is difficult to see how we could improve it, given the way payments come in. Obviously the way to improve the process is to get more people onto the net and settling via debit cards rather than completing bits of paper and sending in cheques.</p>
<p>The thrust is to get the whole process as efficient as possible, so we don’t have reconciliation problems. We continue to talk to our bankers to see if there is anything that they can do to assist us in improving the process.</p>
<h5 id="what-issues-arise-on-the-wholesale-side">We have talked about the retail side. What issues arise on the wholesale side?</h5>
<p>On the wholesale side, we do offer group pension policies and bulk purchase annuities. In these cases, we may have a large sum delivered to us in the form of cash, bonds and/or equities. Whilst this is not a collection as such, we do need to have notice that such sums are going to be delivered so that we can invest it correctly.</p>
<h5 id="do-you-retain-control-for-activities-in-the-money-markets">Do you retain control for activities in the money markets?</h5>
<p>There is a distinction between operational liquidity, which is managed by Group Treasury, and the management of the investment portfolio. As part of managing the investment portfolio, liquidity has to be managed, but this shouldn’t be dictated by operational liquidity. That is Group Treasury’s remit – the operational liquidity within the business as well as shareholders funds at the parent company level. If the investment managers choose to go into cash, then that’s their decision and they would also deal in the money markets on behalf of policyholder funds.</p>
<p>For the general insurance business, cash and operational liquidity are pooled with all our other shareholder funds in Group Treasury and we will either invest those as part of shareholder funds in money market instruments or apply them to satisfy other corporate requirements.</p>
<p>Group Treasury also deals with the investments of Legal &amp; General Bank, which are primarily money market instruments – short term FRNs, Commercial Paper and mortgage-backed securities. We also manage the day-to-day cash flow for the bank arising from mortgages and deposits.</p>
<p>To the extent that there are other parts of the business that have working capital requirements, we will provide a loan facility. We provide a market-priced facility for that working capital, which is then simply adjusted in line with operational cash flows on a daily basis.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-treat-payments-going-out">How do you treat payments going out?</h5>
<p>The bulk are settled via BACS although we still also produce cheques for settlements.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-plan-for-these-payments">How do you plan for these payments?</h5>
<p>The businesses produce their own rolling monthly cash flow forecasts, which are used to determine the flows to the Investment portfolio or drawings under the Group Treasury facilities. Group Treasury produce a consolidated cash flow, which is used to determine the group’s overall funding requirement to be satisfied via Commercial paper or MTN issuance and /or an increase/decrease in the investment portfolio of short term-liquid investments.</p>
<p>For the policyholder side, this is a bit more difficult. Again, there are cash flows produced for that and these will include clearly known flows that will have to be factored in by the investment manager.</p>
<h5 id="will-the-tie-up-with-barclays-have-any-impact-on-what-we-have-been-talking-about">Will the tie up with Barclays have any impact on what we have been talking about?</h5>
<p>As we move towards more streamlined and automated collections such as debit card payments, the process will become more efficient and so we will be able to deal with the larger volumes. The collection bank account arrangements will still be operated basically in the same way. We will continue to review the bank account structure and the providers of the banking service on a regular basis.</p>
<h5 id="how-do-you-go-about-it">I imagine that interest rate risk is the key financial risk that you need to manage. How do you go about it?</h5>
<p>Yes it is. Treasury has direct responsibility for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The interest rate exposure associated with debt liability management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The asset and liability aspect of interest rate risk exposure within the bank.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The debt side, if it is a general core element of funding, will be managed on a floating rate basis. Our belief is that floating offers the lowest real costs. We will tap the market in whatever form to get the lowest floating rate. If we have to finance another part of the business, then we would match that on a basis that was appropriate for that business via internal funding. For example, we might select an element of long dated fixed rate funding if we are putting equity or subordinated debt into the business.</p>
<p>Any surplus shareholders funds managed by Group Treasury will be retained in short dated or liquid investments. Occasionally we might take a limited view on the yield curve and position that portfolio accordingly.</p>
<p>For the bank, we have a low risk appetite, which requires us to match assets and liabilities. So, for example, if we were offering a capped or a fixed rate mortgage we would hedge that with a corresponding swap or cap based on either the retail or the wholesale element of funding. It is easier if we are financing on a three-month floating basis to apply a cap or swap on the back of that. This is more difficult for retail funding, but we have tried to overcome this by creating a Libor deposit product. We would take out the appropriate derivatives to bring the gap between asset and liability as narrow as possible. As a regulated bank, we establish limits that reflect our low risk profile.</p>
<p>The foreign currency risk is limited. We do worry about translation exposure for our overseas assets, but they are relatively small. We don’t really have much in the way of foreign currency transaction exposure. True currency economic exposure isn’t really a risk that we have to worry about because the businesses are local and they are run locally.</p>
<h5 id="where-does-the-treasury-management-system-fit">Can we talk about the technology side? Where does the Treasury Management System fit?</h5>
<p>We operate an integrated Treasury management system, which covers the dealing, settlement, confirmation and accounting for all treasury transactions undertaken on behalf of the finance and parent companies as well as Legal &amp; General Bank. But we have not created any interfaces either with the operational business and product systems for cash flow management. In addition, at this stage, we have left our EFT systems as stand-alone and have not sought to create an interface with our treasury management because of its wider access.</p>
<h5 id="do-you-use-an-online-dealing-system">Do you use an online dealing system?</h5>
<p>We have noticed a number of developments in this area. Our system providers, Quantum, are developing their own dealing system, which sounds quite attractive to us as something with straight through processing makes sense. There is still uncertainty as to which system will have the largest pool of banks as potential deal counterparties – Quantum are obviously asking us to help them by requesting our bankers to join the Quantum system. There is sense in going down that route, but it is just a matter of waiting to see which route wins.</p>
<h5 id="in-what-other-ways-do-you-use-the-internet">In what other ways do you use the Internet?</h5>
<p>At the moment, we use it for information purposes – we take bank feeds on information, for example – we don’t actually use it for any dealing. We also have concerns over moving funds on the net – we are happy to do the deals, but, for the foreseeable future, all the settlement will be away from the net.</p>
<h5 id="what-are-the-key-issues-affecting-any-part-of-your-activity-at-the-moment">What are the key issues affecting any part of your activity at the moment?</h5>
<p>We seem to be encountering more and more difficulties in terms of sufficient resources in the provision of banking services. The banks have moved towards a more coordinated, centralised basis. We have a lot of questions that we have to try to get answers to but it is getting more difficult to find staff in the banks who either are able to or have the time to take ownership of the problem.</p>
<h5 id="why-is-that">Why is that?</h5>
<p>I think that the banks are restructuring and generally slimming. I think it is nothing more than a belief that things have become more efficient and that we shouldn’t need their help. Whilst the number of queries has gone down, there are still queries. We do need individuals within our operational banks that can handle our businesses’ banking issues. It is all very well the banks chasing the more profitable derivative and fx business but it is the bank that serves our operational businesses best that is more likely to receive a larger slice of such business than any other bank, providing, of course, they are a player in the relevant fx or derivative market.</p></div>
