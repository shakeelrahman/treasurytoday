<p>The world has become accustomed to virtual meetings, to the etiquette of Zoom, and conducting business from afar. Going digital and doing things virtually has worked for most, but some things have been lost from the working culture of corporates during the pandemic. And it’s not just conversations by the watercooler, or while making tea in the staff kitchen that are now missed.</p>
<p>For international companies that need to stay on top of the latest regulatory developments in China, the pandemic has proved challenging, especially if they are trying to keep pace with the developments from afar. The lack of face-to-face, in-person meetings with the team in China means that it has been harder to keep abreast of the complexity, nuances and background information of the latest regulations.</p>
<p>Tony Wood, Partner, at Deloitte China comments that managing, and staying on top of, the latest regulations has become more challenging as a result of the pandemic. While this issue isn’t unique to China, the lack of travel to the mainland has meant it has become more challenging for multinationals to understand the latest developments from afar. “The inability for foreign companies and management to travel to China has made things more challenging,” comments Wood. “There has been a shift to the onshore management of regulations,” he adds.</p>
<p>In the past, managers may have frequently travelled from Hong Kong, but now they have not been to China for over two years, he explains. This is having a knock-on effect on how such regulations are being approached. And for executives at multinationals who may have made an annual trip to China, the lack of face-to-face time with people on the ground means they have missed out on really understanding the intricacies and direction of the local regulation. “Firms are increasingly reliant on onshore management to reflect the consistent view of law and regulation,” says Wood.</p>
<p>And even though there has been a global pandemic, there was no slowing in the pace of Chinese regulation. China is both seeking to relax regulations and liberalise its economy and at the same time it is seeking to restrict and control how that is done.</p>
<p>The regulatory environment is challenging for corporate treasurers. Xuelin Chen, Director of Group Treasury at Trip.com Group – based in Shanghai – comments on the challenges in staying on top of China’s various regulations. “The pace of change is definitely a challenge,” she tells Treasury Today Asia.</p>
<p>“The other big challenge is the interpretation of laws and regulations by different levels of authorities. The Chinese language is not a precise language and the laws are sometimes phrased in a way where there could be different interpretations. As a result local governments give different guidance to companies and sometimes the applications of rules can be very different. From time to time central government and regulators issue circulars attempting to clarify and align nationwide practices. However, those only correct a small part of the problem,” Chen explains. Trip.com Group has a presence in a number of different regions in China and these are the kind of difficulties that she encounters on a daily basis, she adds.</p>
<p>This is the kind of complexity that has to be managed on a daily basis by treasury teams on the ground in China. And for managers that are based elsewhere, it is even more difficult for them to get a handle on what kinds of demands are being made on their treasuries.</p>
<p>International companies that have a presence in various countries find the regulation in China unique in many respects. China, unlike other countries, still has a relatively-short history when it comes to law-making, notes Wood at Deloitte, and it is possible for companies to get overwhelmed by the volume and the pace of regulation and keeping up with it. Wood comments that he thinks the larger companies have a better handle on getting clarity on the more complicated law and regulations.</p>
<p>Those large companies may have the resources to effectively invest the time and energy in understanding the complexities of Chinese regulation. But for those who are not based in China, they have had to increasingly rely on the teams on the ground.</p>
<p>For those working onshore in China, there are so many regulatory issues that are a priority for them. If you ask different treasurers what regulations are top of mind at the moment, they are likely to give you different responses.</p>
<p>When asked what the big regulatory trends are in China right now, for example, Vivian Peng, Asia Pacific Treasurer at Flex, comments that the top three regulations that are often discussed and seem to be the top of the agenda are the regulations under capital account cross-border flow, such as cross-border lending and borrowing, and dividends. Also, the internationalisation of the renminbi (RMB) and the rules surrounding it are a big topic. And finally, the policy regarding the CNY exchange rate is also up there in the priority list, according to Peng.</p>
<p>Chen at Trip.com Group comments that if she were to pick the key regulations that are top of mind for corporate treasurers and chief financial officers in China, it would be around tax. She explains, “In my opinion the most important regulation is the tax law, especially corporate income tax and VAT [value-added tax]. There are frequent updates to existing tax rules and regulations, and conditions have to be satisfied by a company in order to receive favourable tax rates that vary from city to city. Within the same city, interpretation of tax laws by district tax bureaus can be different therefore companies may have to follow different guidance by their respective tax bureaus. The relationship with the district and city tax bureaus need to be maintained regularly so there is mutual understanding of the company’s tax practices and compliance.”</p>
<p>Amid these developments there are also broader trends at play that affect regulation in China, and elsewhere. Environmental, social and governance (ESG) topics are hot right now everywhere, and this also applies to those that need to stay on top of Chinese regulations. Peng at Flex comments that ESG is up there in the top lists for corporate treasurers. And this is also in line with a finding by professional services firm PwC in its ‘Regulatory Hot Issues’ report from August 2021. There, PwC states that in recent months, green and sustainable finance has found its way to the top of the to-do list for most financial institutions. And in turn, this also has implications for corporate treasury.</p>
<p>On the topic of ESG, which is much broader than treasury, Wood comments on China’s ambitious targets: it has a target of 2060 for carbon neutrality and has also set a target of reaching peak emissions by 2030. “We anticipate there will be more regulation coming with ESG,” says Wood, adding that interest in the subject has increased very quickly in recent months for his clients. “Looking forward, this regulation will enable the transition of Chinese companies and sectors to have lower carbon footprints. These are huge opportunities and companies will have to invest heavily in understanding these rules and regulations,” says Wood.</p>
<p>This is just one of the major themes that are affecting the regulatory environment in China at the moment. Another major regulatory topic is related to data and privacy, which Peng flags as potentially having an impact for corporate treasurers.</p>
<p>Data concerns have featured in high-profile examples of technology companies that have fallen foul of regulations, which has impacted their overseas listings. This, and other regulation of the technology sector, has had massive implications for some companies – as Treasury Today Asia has previously reported.</p>
<p>The regulatory crackdown on the tech sector has also exposed the divisions in China between its ‘hawks’ and ‘doves’ who are divided over whether Chinese companies’ expansion overseas should be encouraged – and opened up to foreign capital – or whether they should be reined in and restricted.</p>
<p>The issues with the tech sector show how just a single sector can be exposed to the regulation of a number of agencies, including the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) which is increasingly making headlines with its regulation of data and privacy. The issues also exposes the debate about whether the regulation is to be expected, given that the tech companies, particularly the platform companies, are handling vast troves of data – sometimes financial – and that needs to be tightly regulated. The Financial Times estimates that the regulatory crackdown has wiped approximately US$2trn off the market of listed technology companies in the last year.</p>
<p>Wood at Deloitte comments that with the data and privacy laws in China – it’s not more of the same, but rather a continued development of those regulations and their application. Also, he adds, many corporates now have greater understanding on how these rules should be applied.</p>
<p>Chen at Trip.com Group notes that data is a hot topic, as well as anti-monopoly regulations, which she says are likely to be top of mind for corporate treasurers and CFOs. She tells Treasury Today Asia, “Anti-monopoly regulations and data privacy have become an important focus since last year, after a few historical fines to certain big internet companies over their market practices and data handling as ‘example-setting’ cases by the authority.”</p>
<p>These are some of the issues that have been dominating headlines in recent months. And then another major, relatively new trend is that of cryptocurrencies and digital currencies. In China, much attention has been paid to the e-CNY project, China’s central bank digital currency and how it is progressing. Treasury Today Asia has previously reported on the opportunities of the currency – which is viewed as a digital replacement for cash – and how treasurers need to be prepared.</p>
<p>And as far as cryptocurrencies – such as Bitcoin – are concerned, China has taken action to ensure that individuals and companies do not speculate on what is viewed as a highly-volatile asset. Wood notes that the Chinese authorities have been clear about not wanting third party or retail speculation in cryptocurrencies, which, in the context of the recent huge swings of volatility in cryptocurrency markets, has been seen as a positive for Chinese investors.</p>
<p>Besides, for many corporates, crypto and digital assets are still a bit futuristic, particularly for large, traditional firms. This is something that Peng agrees with and she comments crypto is still a long way off for traditional industries to start considering.</p>
<p>Crypto is one hot topic for regulators, and China is seeking to control the fallout that might occur if there is a dramatic drop in the value of crypto assets. On the one hand China is seeking to restrict and control, and then on the other it wants to liberalise and encourage new investment.</p>
<p>One such opportunity with investment in the Greater Bay Area – is a project that brings nine cities in mainland China and Hong Kong and Macau into an area where they are linked into a ‘megalopolis’.</p>
<p>Gordon Orr, an advisor for consultancy McKinsey, discusses the benefits of the project in a blog post and notes that the GBA region has been growing faster than the average across China. “It’s been part of the continuing shift of the centre of gravity of China’s economic activity. It’s been moving south for 30 years, and you’re really seeing it now. What you’ve got now is a cocktail of inputs that’s really ready to bubble up.”</p>
<p>Orr continues: “This is the youngest region in China. It’s the most educated, most talent rich region in China. It’s enormously capital rich. It’s got fantastic infrastructure, and it’s got this unique thing with Hong Kong connected to it that creates a global capability and global connectivity to capital and professional services that’s unique.”</p>
<p>The PwC Hot Issues report notes that this area is an opportunity that requires strategic action on the part of financial institutions, especially since China’s regulatory authorities have issued guidance on how the region will be opened up and developed. The most recently issued circulars, for example, cover issues such as economic development, facilitating trade and investment, and promoting the internationalisation of the RMB.</p>
<p>Wood anticipates there will be greater liberalisation with geographies such as the Greater Bay Area (GBA), and also with certain sectors, such as financial services. However, he notes, that liberalisation goes hand in hand with more regulation and rule-making “I feel the two things go hand in hand. We are not going to see a laissez-faire market opening,” he comments. Such opening up, and increased regulation, will need to be understood and managed onshore in mainland China, which in turn will create a continued demand for talent.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges, China’s prospects are buoyant, even though it has been badly affected by Covid and has undergone severe lockdowns. The prospects for China also include opportunities for Hong Kong as a financial centre. Or, in the words of Edmond Lau, Senior Executive Director of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, “The message for the financial industry is clear: no long-term strategy is credible without China. And no China strategy is complete without Hong Kong.”</p>
<p>More broadly, Deloitte’s Wood puts the development of the laws and regulation in China in the context of its economic liberalisation and the opportunities that exist for multinationals. “China still presents significant growth and economic opportunities for many companies despite the challenges of the past few years,” says Wood at Deloitte.</p>
<p>He adds that China is committed to market opening and liberalisation through its economic plan, and this also includes a commitment to Hong Kong as an international financial centre. “I remain highly optimistic that the economy of China will remain attractive for many companies,” says Wood.</p>
<p>When discussing the challenges with navigating all of this, Peng at Flex comments that the regulations in China are being relaxed every year. “I think the key to understand the regulation is to understand the logic and rationale of the policy, which needs the treasurer’s understanding of macro economy of China and the world,” she says.</p>

<p>With various laws, guidelines and pronouncements, the regulatory landscape in Asia Pacific can soon become a checklist of acronyms and alphabet soup. Keeping on top of the region’s regulations is already a challenging task for treasurers, particularly with its diversity of markets, and that is set to become more difficult. Broader trends are afoot – such as the emergence of central bank issued digital currencies and a focus on environment, social and governance (ESG) issues – which are likely to be followed by even more rules and regulations.</p>
<p>The regulatory landscape is already challenging, and in some markets, such as China, it is constantly changing. “China is doing a lot very quickly,” says Tony Wood, Partner, Risk Advisory at Deloitte China. For treasurers, he says, “The macro challenge is the sheer pace of change and staying compliant with changes they may not have been aware of.”</p>
<p>And in other jurisdictions in Asia, there is an opacity to the regulations that can be difficult to navigate. The regulations could be published in an elaborate form of the local language, for example, which is difficult to translate. Not only that, Wood says, for Western companies “It can be hard work to understand what the intention is” of the various laws, regulations, guidelines and pronouncements. “Everyone struggles with that,” says Wood. He adds there are technology solutions available that aim to keep users abreast of the regulations across the region, but as yet they do not adequately solve this issue.</p>
<p>For treasurers, there is a lot to navigate, especially given the diversity of law and regulation in the various markets. “It is particularly difficult for smaller companies that are in many of these jurisdictions and need to stay on top of everything,” says Wood.</p>
<p>The range of regulations can be overwhelming, and for corporates they can be those that affect them directly, or those that are more indirect – with implications from regulations for the financial services industry, for example. Wood points to the trend of bank resolution regimes in various markets – such as China and Singapore – that will have implications for cash and liquidity ringfencing. This also comes in the context of the regulatory drive for greater transparency about where money is sitting and how inter-company positions are being managed, he says.</p>
<p>And another example of a macro trend that is affecting treasurers in Asia at the moment is the US sanctions regime, and how it is affecting individuals in Hong Kong, for example. In particular, the ‘connected parties’ of sanctioned individuals can be difficult to get clarity on and treasurers could find they have issues in their supply chain, comments Wood.</p>
<p>While issues such as sanctions, anti-money laundering or know your customer have been regulated for years, there are broader mega trends afoot that are new territory for corporates and regulators alike.</p>
<p>A mega trend that is affecting businesses of all types is data, and even treasurers are beginning to think how they can be more like Amazon or Google in how they use it to drive better outcomes. As big data becomes more commonplace, however, so do the regulations surrounding it – although it is still new territory for many.</p>
<p>Wood points to the information and security laws and regulations as a trend in the region. “We see a hardening of the regulation around those laws – for good reason – and all the countries in this region are in a debate about the privacy and the ownership of data,” he says.</p>
<p>In markets such as Indonesia, there are particular challenges around the cross-border management of data and information. This has forced international companies to have onshore operations and systems, and run subsidiaries with separate governance structures. “You have to be aware of these rules and what you can and cannot do. And it’s not just being aware of the rules – you have to be aware of how they are being interpreted,” says Wood.</p>
<p>In many respects, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which addresses the handling of personal data by companies, is the benchmark for the region. In fact, the GDPR has had a direct impact on local regulations. A regulatory outlook report from Deloitte, for example, notes that the GDPR has influenced regulators in Asia Pacific with Thailand and India using the European rules as the basis for their own privacy regulations.</p>
<p>And the GDPR has also had an impact in Singapore. According to law firm Ashurst, “The GDPR gained prominence internationally partly due to its increased financial penalties for breaches – and that had a significant effect on organisations around the world, significantly increasing the visibility of data privacy breaches at senior management level. Increased penalties for data privacy law breaches have subsequently been discussed in various jurisdictions – and Singapore has now followed suit.”</p>
<p>Anton Ruddenklau, Partner, Head of Financial Services Advisory, KPMG in Singapore, points to the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s principles for artificial intelligence and data analytics in the financial sector. The principles – ‘FEAT’ – of fairness, ethics, accountability and transparency are similar to those of other markets, such as the UK, regarding data, comments Ruddenklau.</p>
<p>With corporates investing more in data, and building artificial intelligence alongside it, these regulations will increasingly affect corporate treasurers. And in this brave new digital world, there are other trends they also need to keep on top of. One area that treasurers need to get a grip on is the managing of digital and crypto assets. Ruddenklau estimates that 8% of global clients have digital assets on their balance sheets. As it stands, there is no coherent standardised regulation that has taken shape to address this new area, although some markets have attempted to clarify the taxation framework for cryptocurrencies, for example.</p>
<p>In April 2020, for example, Singapore’s inland revenue issued guidance on the tax treatment of digital tokens and for initial coin offerings. Alan Lau, Partner, Head of Financial Services, Tax, KPMG in Singapore comments, “There are more questions than answers on how to tax crypto.” He adds that even the valuation of such assets can be challenging.</p>
<p>These issues coincide with a wider trend of stable coins and digital currencies that will be issued by central banks. Also, there is the long-awaited stable coin – Diem – from Facebook, all of which Ruddenklau expects to be launched in the near future. For treasurers, this means they will need to be aware of the implications. The question, says Ruddenklau, for treasurers is when they need to become proficient in crypto. “It is probably only two years away,” he says, adding that their assets will likely have a crypto element to them soon.</p>
<p>Along with data and digital assets, another mega trend affecting corporates is ESG, and more regulations are expected to come into force, in a more standardised way. A regulatory outlook report from Deloitte notes that previously ESG reporting has been mostly pushed by stock exchanges and for publicly-listed companies that are of a certain size. That is soon expected to change, and there are forums such as the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System that are expected to bring further regulation. Its purpose is to “share best practices and contribute to the development of environment and climate risk management in the financial sector and to mobilise mainstream finance to support the transition toward a sustainable economy.” This would have the intention of pushing the financial sector towards the climate goals that were set out in the Paris Agreement (for example, to limit global warming to 2C above pre-industrial levels and aim for 1.5C).</p>
<p>The regulatory landscape is expected to become more standardised in how it handles ESG rules. So far, there has been a patchwork of approaches. Deloitte notes, for example, that corporates have been subjected to various global and local reporting frameworks. And on top of this, there have been a variety of approaches. For example, in Singapore, corporates have been expected to ‘comply or explain’. Meanwhile in Australia, Japan, Malaysia and Thailand, for example, the ESG reporting was voluntary.</p>
<p>Broader than such reporting requirements, the ESG rules will affect treasurers in other ways. Ruddenklau comments how ESG rules will affect how goods are financed, the type of supply chains they have, and how businesses are run. The regulations have so far had an impact on capital markets and fixed income bonds, for example, he says. “We were talking about ‘green bonds’ a few years ago; now we are talking about a green supply chain,” Ruddenklau comments.</p>
<p>These changes mean that corporates will be assessed by their ESG risks when they want to borrow. Ruddenklau explains that for companies that are carbon heavy – like fossil fuels, heavy manufacturing, or data centres – their cost of funding will be higher unless they make a commitment to have a low impact.</p>
<p>“This will have a profound impact on the way treasurers understand ESG,” says Ruddenklau, adding that it will affect third parties and their supply chain, how they run their bank relationships and how they access financing.</p>
<p>Lau comments that the public sector has taken the lead on green financing. For example, the Hong Kong’s Green Bond Programme is a government initiative that leads in issuing green bonds to fund projects that have the aim of helping the environment and moving to a low-carbon economy. “The idea is for the government to take the lead and show the private sector how to do it and develop the whole ecosystem,” says Lau. If it was left to the private sector to develop, it would have taken a long time – the fastest way to scale up the programme was for the government to take the lead, he says.</p>
<p>Hong Kong has also been at the centre of another green initiative, the Alliance for Green Commercial Banks, which aims to “finance the infrastructure and business solutions needed to urgently address climate change”. The alliance was set up by the International Finance Corporation and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and held its first meeting in April this year.</p>
<p>And in Singapore, MAS has created the Green Finance Industry Taskforce to accelerate green finance, which will likely have implications for treasurers as the guidance filters down. In May it issued a guide for climate-related disclosures and a framework for green trade finance, as well as green finance in other sectors such as real estate. Gillian Tan, an Assistant Managing Director at MAS, said at the time of the announcement, “These initiatives will also contribute to global efforts to achieve greater consistency and comparability in climate-related disclosures, as well as provide investors and market participants with the necessary information for climate risk analysis and investment decision-making.” As one of several mega trends that are impacting the regulatory landscape for treasurers, a move to such standardisation and consistency will surely be welcomed.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>Regulation is a challenge for treasurers everywhere – particularly for those that operate across multiple countries or regions. This challenge is all the greater in Asia Pacific, which is characterised by numerous disparate countries, currencies, cultures and regulatory bodies. As a result, some treasurers need to stay on top of a large volume of regulatory developments. Companies operating in multiple markets across the region may be exposed to thousands of changes each year.</p>
<p>As Christopher Emslie, Asian Regional Treasurer at General Mills, explained in a recent Treasury Today Asia interview: “It’s quite a diverse region, because of the different regulations and the different way things work and the different ways that people look at business. It’s also quite challenging because the environment is continually changing. You can have new regulations announced in India or China, and then you have a day to react before the new rules come into effect. So you really need to be on your toes, and have trust in your partners to give you the right information so you can overcome these challenges.”</p>
<p>So which regulatory developments and initiatives should treasurers be aware of in the coming months? How can treasurer stay abreast of upcoming regulatory developments – and how can they ensure they are best placed to adapt to new regulations when the need arises?</p>
<h4 id=""apacs-regulatory-environment-an-overview"">APAC’s regulatory environment: an overview</h4>
<p>The region has a fragmented regulatory environment, with requirements varying from market to market, explains Aziz Parvez, head of Regional Corporate Sales, Global Transaction Services at Bank of America. “On one side of the spectrum, there are mature markets such as Australia, Singapore and Hong Kong which are open economies with limited currency controls – and on the other end, there are markets such as Vietnam, China and India with stricter controls,” he explains.</p>
<p>The latter can be more challenging, as companies may only be able to move or utilise their funds if they meet regulatory requirements, Parvez explains – “and in times of need, this may prevent the efficient use of funds. This further emphasises the importance for treasurers to have an accurate view of their funding requirements, so they can achieve optimal use of their funds.”</p>
<p>For treasurers trying to adopt a standardised approach throughout the region, remaining abreast of these disparate regulatory regimes is not straightforward. As Adesh Sarup, Head of Transaction Banking, North Asia, ANZ International explains, “The challenge of different regulations and rules across different countries in Asia, different currencies and available hedging options, the differing ability to physically or notionally manage liquidity pools, trade related risks and balance sheet management, are well known.”</p>
<h4 id=""disparate-markets"">Disparate markets</h4>
<p>The challenge of staying on top of regulatory changes is compounded by the fact that regulators in the region are not all travelling in the same direction at any given time. Carol Mah, Global Treasury Advisory Services Senior Manager, Deloitte Southeast Asia, points out that Asia includes both free and highly regulated markets – and while some of those markets are in the process of reducing or relaxing regulatory barriers, others are tightening or changing their regulations. “Countries with currency exchange controls are usually more challenging, as they hinder cash transactions and prevent the use of financial instruments to hedge FX risk,” she adds.</p>
<p>At the same time, other factors can drive the regulatory landscape, including civil situations, geopolitical events, economic growth and investment opportunities. “A number of country regulators took quick action in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to support their local economies and protect their currencies and balance of payments,” says Mah. “This resulted in more countries going into negative rate territory.”</p>
<p>And another emerging factor is the focus on data security and privacy, says Balaji Natarajan, Head of PCM Product, Asia at ANZ Institutional. “While on the one hand, these measures strengthen local operations, they can also pose challenges if data localisation hampers ease of access and control which corporate treasurers require – and it adds to the complexity of managing the different norms/requirements imposed by different countries,” he notes.</p>



<h4 id="""">Transition from LIBOR</h4>
<p>As Carol Mah, Global Treasury Advisory Services Senior Manager at Deloitte Southeast Asia points out, “The LIBOR transition coming into effect by the end of 2021 is still a valid topic for companies with large debt portfolios and LIBOR-related instruments.”</p>
<p>The replacement of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) was set in motion following discovery of a widespread rate-rigging scandal in the wake of the financial crisis. As a result of the subsequent investigations, banks around the world were fined more than US$9bn in relation to the manipulation of rates. The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) took over the administration of LIBOR in 2014, and working groups began looking into how the rates could be reformed. Then in 2017, Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), announced the intention that banks would no longer be required to submit to LIBOR after the end of 2021.</p>
<p>The deadline for transitioning to LIBOR alternatives is fast approaching. By the end of this year, the ICE Benchmark Administration is expected to cease the publication of LIBOR in CHF, EUR, GBP and JPY, as well as one-week and two-week USD LIBOR. For the remaining USD rates, a stay of execution is expected: in December, the IBA published a consultation paper proposing to extend the cessation of the remaining USD LIBOR tenors until June 2023. However, the delay is intended to allow outstanding contracts to mature, and the market has been advised to stop entering into new USD LIBOR contracts as soon as practicable.</p>
<p>Rather than relacing LIBOR with another single rate, each currency will have its own risk-free rate – these include the Swiss average overnight rate (SARON), Euro short-term rate (€STER), the Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) for GBP; Tokyo Overnight Average Rate (TONAR) and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) for USD. Different administrators are responsible for each of the risk-free rates.</p>
<p>For treasurers, navigating the transition away from LIBOR is a significant undertaking. References to LIBOR can be embedded into many different types of transaction, including bank loans, bonds, derivatives and commercial contracts. As such, identifying and addressing all of a company’s exposures can take time – and may involve working with colleagues across the organisation, from tax and legal to sales and purchasing. In some cases, existing contracts may need to be renegotiated. Treasurers also need to make sure that their treasury systems and processes are ready for the transition from LIBOR.</p>



<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<h4 id=""further-challenges"">Further challenges</h4>
<p>While the region’s disparate and complex nature is well understood, another challenge for treasurers is the speed at which regulations can change. “Recently, regulatory changes have been quick, and have sometimes made it difficult for treasurers to keep up or even take advantage of the evolving environment,” explains Mah.</p>
<p>She adds: “The speed of change has exacerbated the need for treasurers to quickly and effectively interpret the changes in order to ensure compliance within the timeframes, and respond accurately to a change in regulation.”</p>
<p>As well as these issues, Sarup also notes that treasurers are having to deal with emerging challenges relating to operational risk. “An example of that is the risk of sudden business change, eg a business model change on account of geopolitical tensions, or the current COVID-19 pandemic,” he says. “Another example is the challenge imposed by cyber threats and events – these can vary widely in different Asian markets.”</p>
<p>Where the current pandemic is concerned, he notes that the trapped cash challenge has been exacerbated: “While monetary policy across Asia has focused on enabling adequate liquidity, this has reduced yield and restricted the ability to effectively move trapped cash where required.”</p>
<h4 id=""help-or-hindrance"">Help or hindrance?</h4>
<p>While managing the speed and volume of regulatory change can be a challenge, different regulatory changes can also bring new opportunities to manage cash in the region more effectively – depending on the direction of travel in individual markets. As BofA’s Parvez points out, “In recent years, we have seen improvements in the regulatory climate, with regulators bringing changes to ease controls to facilitate businesses operating in the region.”</p>
<p>He explains that regulations play a very important role in effective cash management, especially when it comes to liquidity management: “In today’s environment, as companies look to consolidate liquidity, regulations can play a critical role. Markets that permit free movement of currencies allow companies to have better control and more efficient use of their funds.”</p>
<p>Natarajan, meanwhile, says that regulators and central banks across Asian countries are encouraging digitisation. And with greater digitisation – ie business volumes being transacted via digital platforms – payment services have opened up to newer players, such as non-banks that compete with banks and traditional service providers. “This is good as it leads to innovation and growth of the industry,” he says.</p>
<p>In addition, he says there is a push towards building real-time national infrastructure, “which is driving faster real-time collections, reduced days sales outstanding (DSO) and better control over cash flows – all of which are advantageous to regional treasurers.”</p>
<p>Of course, regulation can also be a “double-edged sword”, as Mah explains. “Even a positive change, such as an easing of cash repatriation back to the home country, has some implications on ‘business as usual’ activities,” she says.</p>



<blockquote><p>Companies in specific sectors will have to comply and provide environmental data to ensure their financing needs and issue debt on the capital markets.</p></blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">Carol Mah, Global Treasury Advisory Services Senior Manager, Deloitte Southeast Asia</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>Likewise, Natarajan points out that any regulatory change that arises due to protectionism or a single country’s national interests “can often hinder effective regional cash management.”</p>
<h4 id=""developments-to-watch"">Developments to watch</h4>
<p>“While corporate treasury is not as regulated as financial institutions, they are indirectly impacted by the regulations that banks have to abide to,” comments Mah. “A case in point is the Basel III regulation which impacted corporate use of notional pooling structures.”</p>
<p>As such, there are a number of regulatory developments and initiatives that treasurers should be aware of in the coming months. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>LIBOR transition.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The rise of open banking.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The growing use of central bank digital currencies.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The adoption of ISO 20022 in correspondent banking.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Changes to foreign exchange management rules.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Data and digital initiatives intended to drive digital adoption across industry and business sectors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Treasurers may also need to be aware of regulatory changes that affect specific industries and their supply chains.</p>
<p>Parvez says another a key development this year is in the use of technology in reporting processes. “A number of countries are moving in this direction, and that should help companies create efficiency in their own practices,” he says, adding that treasurers should look forward to see how they can adopt these developments.</p>
<p>In addition, he says that China has announced regulations to further facilitate cross-border trade and investment. “They have also eased some of the cross-border borrowing and lending quota,” he says. “These can help companies in managing excess liquidity.”</p>
<p>And as Mah notes, sustainability and green finance are key topics for financial institutions. “Companies in specific sectors will have to comply and provide environmental data to ensure their financing needs and issue debt on the capital markets,” she says.</p>
<h4 id=""staying-abreast-of-changes"">Staying abreast of changes</h4>
<p>Keeping up to date with regulatory change is important, not only to avoid any compliance issues, but also to enable the company to take advantage of any new opportunities that may emerge.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways that treasurers can keep informed about upcoming changes. One important source is the regulators themselves, so treasurers should subscribe to any relevant circulars and news alerts. That said, keeping track of changes across multiple markets can be challenging – so treasurers should also consult other sources that may be able to help them collate and digest relevant changes.</p>
<p>The company’s bank partners should be able to provide regulatory updates that can help treasurers understand which regulatory developments are relevant to their businesses. “At Bank of America, we stay close to the regulators in each of the markets that we operate in and as such, we are able to provide quick updates to our clients, whenever changes are released,” says Parvez.</p>
<p>Other useful sources of information include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In-house tax, legal and compliance teams.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Local in-country management teams.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Consultancies and advisory practices.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Government and industry trade associations.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Treasury peer groups and local associations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="""">Adapting to new regulation</h4>
<p>While it is important to stay abreast of any relevant regulatory changes, treasurers also need to be able to adapt to any developments in order to avoid any fines or other penalties that could arise from non-compliance. As Deloitte’s Mah points out, “Treasurers need to act quickly when new regulations are announced, not when they take effect.”</p>
<p>She adds: “Getting new procedures or systems in place ahead of time can help ensure that organisations can finesse any delays, educate or train employees, and find the right support from different business communities.”</p>
<p>“Needless to say, adapting and planning for regulatory changes is important for every business,” says ANZ’s Sarup. He notes that to an extent, treasurers can mitigate challenges and changes by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implementing/adopting an effective treasury platform that caters to the changes and has the ability to be future-proofed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Adopting optimum and effective heedging solutions to address short-to-medium-term geopolitical disruptions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Having an ongoing programme management function in place to cater for regulatory changes so that they are not hampered by a lack of resources or a lack of information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But some regulatory changes are more pressing than other. BofA’s Parvez points out that while some regulatory changes are mandatory, and must be adopted within specified timelines, “in other instances, adoptions may vary depending on the impact and timeline stipulated by the regulators.” Likewise, some changes are more complicated than others. “In any case, it is in companies’ best interests to react promptly and aim to incorporate the changes required sooner in order to ensure minimal disruptions to operations,” he says.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>As LIBOR’s 2021 demise in most currencies hurtles closer, corporate treasury teams have limited time to transition their LIBOR exposures to new risk-free rates like SONIA, SOFR and €STER. While treasury teams agree the new risk-free rates are a better instrument, the weighty task of switching every LIBOR exposure, woven into bonds to banks loans and contracts with suppliers, setting up new systems, and venturing into a market where best practice and standards are still evolving, is a source of some trepidation.</p>
<p>Most corporate treasury teams agree that the new risk-free rates are better than LIBOR. LIBOR reflects the cost of banks’ lending to each other so when a crisis spikes like in 2008 or the early days of the pandemic, banks pass on the additional risk to companies that are already paying a margin to their lenders embedded in their cost of capital and funding. It exposes borrowers to rising interest payments just as economic conditions worsen, says Shaun Kennedy, Group Treasurer at Associated British Ports, ABP. “I can’t believe we stuck with LIBOR for so long, it is a terrible benchmark for corporates. LIBOR was designed 50 years ago to pass risk onto companies because at the time banks couldn’t manage that risk, but the world has moved on.” Because the new rates are based on overnight lending markets, less risky than lending funds out unsecured for three or six months, they strip out most of the credit, liquidity and term risk premia common to LIBOR.</p>
<h3 id=""finding-libor"">Finding LIBOR</h3>
<p>Step one in the LIBOR transition involves companies finding their LIBOR exposures, woven like knotweed through bond issuance, bank loans, intercompany loans and derivative portfolios. Although much of ABP’s LIBOR exposure is netting off against itself, Kennedy estimates the company is around 40% of the way through transitioning LIBOR-linked contracts lying in swaps, bonds, loans and US private placements with a notional value of around £4bn. The company made trail-blazing progress transitioning its predominantly sterling LIBOR exposure to SONIA when it moved around £65m worth of bonds to the new benchmark in 2019. A key challenge has been unpicking the different legal wording within contracts, says Kennedy. “There are details around how certain products might react to a permanent cessation of LIBOR which was not envisaged within contracts when they were entered into at the time.”</p>
<p>At London-headquartered British American Tobacco (BAT) Group Treasurer Neil Wadey has mapped all the company’s LIBOR exposures, which mostly lie in the bond portfolio, intercompany and derivatives. A particular focus is on tracking down LIBOR in internal floating inter-company loans, running down exposures and not creating new ones. “We are setting up a process to move all these to risk free rates going forward,” he says.</p>
<p>Even for sophisticated treasury teams like BAT and ABP, familiar with complex regulations, finding and ticking off a dollar LIBOR bond swapped into sterling in one part of the portfolio or a series of LIBOR-linked bank loans in another, is a time-consuming and gruelling process. It leaves John Grout, a retired corporate treasurer and finance director, and an independent expert on the LIBOR Oversight Committee, particularly concerned about the ability of mid-size and smaller companies sitting outside the FTSE100 to successfully manage the process.</p>
<p>His overriding message to this treasury cohort is start now. Many companies will have LIBOR exposures woven into supply agreements, he warns, explaining that finding them will involve treasury working with purchasing and sales departments and dusting off old financial contracts. “Take a sales contract with a buyer on 30 days credit,” he says. “If they pay late, they will pay interest at ‘X’ over LIBOR. Elsewhere a construction group will find changes to their contract pricing will have a LIBOR clause in the relative currencies. Companies may still be operating with a component supplier under a master contract based on LIBOR signed 20 years ago, but who has a copy of the contract?” Elsewhere, he advises companies to look at their pension fund arrangements where they often use swaps to switch investments between fixed and floating and short and long-term rates.</p>
<h3 id=""bonds"">Bonds</h3>
<p>Once a company has found its exposure, the transition begins. ABP’s first-of-its kind transition of £65m worth of its bonds to SONIA in 2019 followed bilateral discussions with the company’s end investors. When Kennedy approached the pension funds, asset managers and US life companies holding ABP’s drawn LIBOR debt to say the company was interested in moving to SONIA earlier that year, many weren’t ready. “Some were quite interested, and others said they wanted to see how the market develops,” he recalls. Since that transition however, more of the company’s investors have approached Kennedy ready to switch, he says. “It comes down to saying you are both willing parties and want to transition the product,” he says.</p>
<p>The next step involves drawing up new legal documents that outline the additional spread ABP will add to the margin on the bond. Because SONIA doesn’t have bank credit risk, the SONIA benchmark is generally lower, and Kennedy doesn’t expect any increase in the cost of borrowing as a result of transition. “The process involves agreeing the market implied difference between the two (SONIA and LIBOR) and adding that on top of the instrument for the rest of the life of that particular piece of debt.” As compounded SONIA strips out most of the risk premia common to LIBOR, the bond market has added a premium on top of the compounded SONIA rate based on the average difference between SONIA and LIBOR.</p>
<p>For ABP, which borrows most of its money from non-bank institutions, ditching a floating rate that contains bank credit risk is long overdue. Kennedy is already noticing the new risk-free rate gives a more stable borrowing cost from investors seeking a floating rate, free from the sudden spikes in costs around bank credit concerns. “LIBOR can move around and impact your borrowing costs quite significantly as a corporate,” he says. “It’s frustrating when it has nothing to do with you, more so when you are not borrowing from a bank in the first place.”</p>
<h3 id=""bank-loans"">Bank loans</h3>
<p>Transition in the corporate loan market, were virtually all companies will have some kind of LIBOR loans with banks, has been slower. It is only in recent months that more banks have begun offering non-LIBOR alternatives and flagship corporate names in the sterling market like Tesco and GlaxoSmithKline have taken a lead, drawing up new loan agreements to run off risk free rates. Given the loan market is private, it’s not possible to definitively say how many deals have switched, yet if the Loan Market Association’s (LMA) latest figures are anything to go by activity is still muted and companies – and lenders – need to step up the pace.</p>
<p>Compelled by a lack of leadership, BAT was one of the first companies to structure loans that will switch to risk free rates ahead of the transition when it signed a £6bn multi-currency revolving credit facility with 21 banks in March 2020. “We wanted a transaction that would bridge the cessation of LIBOR beyond 2021, and we hadn’t seen much leadership in the UK market,” said Wadey. Inspired by Shell putting out a SOFR RCF facility, the company decided to structure a commercial transaction coordinated by Barclays and HSBC, banks Wadey names as two of the few leading the LIBOR transition.</p>
<p>The process offers a window into the challenge companies have faced working out their cost of borrowing. Under LIBOR, companies deal with forward looking interest rates, paying interest on the maturity date when they repay the capital, explains Grout. “A company which has drawn on a RCF will know the interest rate and the payment required with the principle six months or three months in advance.” However, under new risk-free rates although companies know how much they have borrowed and are due to pay back, they will only know the interest rate at the end. “The payments process and risk management has to change because you have a retrospective rate,” he explains.</p>
<p>Under the new rates, borrowers will look at the daily interest rates from the time the loan was outstanding and compound it. Alternatively, they could decide to make interest payments on the same day, says Grout. To ensure coupon holders are repaid on the date the coupon falls due, a lag may be introduced whereby companies calculate the compounded interest up to four to five days before maturity. “The market practice around these look back type of arrangements has yet to develop,” says Grout. “If treasury teams decide to pay with a lag, they have to agree how many days they lag. A lot of corporates are saying they are going to wait for market practices to develop. I think by Q1 next year there will be sufficient standard in place.”</p>
<p>For BAT, venturing into this complex and shifting world last March, pragmatism was key. Rather than opting for the lag, Wadey and the team chose for a slightly different 5-day observational shift in the agreement. “There are different approaches, but we decided with our bank group that was the one everyone understood.” Since then, the market has moved towards favouring the lag and although Wadey says he doesn’t like this mechanism as much, BAT is likely to switch to the lag when it renews the 1 year £3bn element of the RCF in March 2021. At which point he also aims to press the button on switching the facility to SONIA once the company’s systems are ready to move to a risk-free rate and book transactions directly into the system. “At the end of the day I can live with an observational shift or lag as long as my system is set up. It’s really an enabling question,” he says, articulating that the key learnings over the last nine months have been around procedure and mechanics, not commercial value.</p>
<p>Rather than these still shifting sands being a cause for concern, proponents say they show that risk free rates are starting to settle on standards and norms. The LMA has published working documents to help guide corporates and says the foundation for new risk-free rates are now in place. Elsewhere, Kennedy says ABP’s treasury team, which has overseen two SONIA-linked deals with banking partners in its loan book this year, has grown comfortable compounding interest and putting a five-day lag into the compounding calculation to ensure a rate five days before the end of the period. “There is now more acceptance of standards compared to discussions earlier in 2020 and at the end of 2019. People talk about lags or an observational shift, but fundamentally you are still compounding a rate over the period and paying at the end.”</p>
<h3 id=""systems"">Systems</h3>
<p>Indeed, setting up new treasury management systems (TMS) that can compound interest and shift accounts from counterparties to new rules could be a bigger headache. BAT runs an integrated system that covers treasury, operations, and risk management. It books loans and derivatives into the system as well as auto-generating cashflows and accounting postings, all set up around LIBOR without any manual interventions. Changing the TMS has involved thrashing out details with suppliers and consultants for the last year, says Wadey. “We weren’t in a great space on this a year ago.”</p>
<p>As for BAT’s derivative exposures, he is still undecided as to whether the company will sign up to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) protocol outlining how companies’ LIBOR-linked interest rate swap exposures will convert to the new risk-free rates. BAT still needs to “get comfortable” with the accounting and tax consequences, he says. “We are looking favourably at the protocol but haven’t signed up to it yet.”</p>
<p>Readying systems has been a similar story at ABP which was reliant on spread sheets for its early SONIA-linked trades as it built and primed a new TMS. Although compounding is complicated, Kennedy reassures it is easily done. “We spent 12 months with our TMS provider going through the calculations. We also completely rebuilt the system, particularly around the accounting model to handle the new products.”</p>
<p>That said, treasury executives are unanimous on the gruelling amounts of time and IT expertise involved in testing and upgrading systems. “It all costs, and it’s not added-value in the main. It just has to be done,” says Wadey whose sympathy goes out to small and mid-sized companies who may not have huge LIBOR exposures, but neither have the resources to put to it.</p>
<h3 id=""reluctance-to-lend"">Reluctance to lend?</h3>
<p>The transition poses another challenge for smaller companies that goes beyond the logistical and practical rigmarole. Grout’s analysis of how the loan market will transition to new risk-free rates gives him cause for concern that smaller companies will struggle to tap bank finance. Although the risk of corporate lending hasn’t changed for banks, the way banks recover the cost of the risk they incur in their own business will be different.</p>
<p>Compounded SONIA strips out most of the credit, liquidity and term risk premia common to LIBOR, reminds Grout. “At the moment that risk which is arising from the banks is paid for because it is embedded in the LIBOR. When you go to risk free overnight rate, none of those premia including bank credit risk are in there.” Banks’ enthusiasm to lend is muted at the best of times, he flags. Corporate lending is a tiny part of banks’ overall balance sheets and for many banks it is simply a way to access more profitable business from companies.</p>
<p>Imagine a scenario where a bank’s own creditworthiness has taken a hit after a crisis and a corporate is applying for another round of bank financing. The bank is likely to make the premium over the new benchmark higher, he argues. “Large treasury teams with strong relationships will be aware of this and are able to negotiate with the banks. It’s the smaller companies who are at risk of being told we are going to charge you SOFR + 150bps instead of LIBOR +120bps and they will just have to accept it,” says Grout. “The question is how many points do the banks add, and where they draw the line.”</p>
<p>Moreover, he adds that banks are unlikely to negotiate levels with multiple, individual corporates but will arrange blanket pricing across a suite of clients. “Companies will have to do what they are told, and this will upset many companies,” he predicts. “It won’t be a significant cost, but it will impact marginal borrowers.” Even though rating agencies and auditors have a keen eye on a smooth transition, he is convinced that smaller companies unable to rely on strong bank relationships with lending syndicates will find themselves in a vulnerable position.</p>
<p>The fact that intercompany lending is based on the new, risk-free rates adds another twist that has put revenue authorities on the alert. They are now wary of companies shifting profits between parent and subsidiary companies or seeking lower rates of tax as they transition their LIBOR exposures, says Grout. However, the overriding concern on the road ahead is the workload for small treasury teams with limited regulatory or financial expertise. Hunting down their LIBOR exposure, bilaterally negotiating the transition and producing the necessary working documents is a significant challenge, especially following Brexit and the impact of COVID. Meanwhile, the clock is ticking for banks to ready their systems and begin marketing risk free rate products to the real economy in earnest.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>“The average global treasury team spends more than one day per week navigating a thicket of KYC requirements. And it’s not getting any easier,” says Delphine Masquelier, Product Manager KYC Compliance Services at SWIFT. The regulatory landscape is evolving fast, making KYC processes increasingly complex. For corporates that use the services of multiple banks, the challenge of just keeping up is magnified several times over as they work to comply with the KYC requests of each one, often across different products.</p>
<p>Hurrah then for the KYC utility, centralising access to common and uniform data and documents. Well, not quite. Despite the KYC ‘industry’ lending itself to the existence of a common platform for sharing otherwise commodified data, it has yet to see a successful delivery.</p>
<p>When Bloomberg announced in April 2019 that it will shut down Entity Exchange, and Refinitiv said in June it is planning to close its KYC-as-a-service offering, low uptake was cited on the death certificate of these high profile utilities. “Many vendors had a go on their own to solve the complex challenge with limited success,” notes Masquelier. “They have inadvertently added to complexity, failed to find a sustainable economic model or, in some cases, created solutions that have not been fit for purpose.”</p>
<p>Mark Trivedi, Managing Director, Head of Client Experience and Firmwide Collateral Transformation, J.P. Morgan has a bit more sympathy for the KYC utility effort. Because AML and KYC rules are delivered as directives, they are not as prescriptive as perhaps imagined, he notes. “This leaves room for local interpretation, and so variability ensues.” Additionally, he says each institution has its own risk tolerance and profile which can also dictate how their requirements are shaped.</p>
<p>The whole process is a moving feast: even if some level of consistency and understanding is achieved, the rules keep changing, says Trivedi. “Adapting regularly to that portfolio of changes makes the establishment of a singular utility very challenging.”</p>
<p>Of course, it may just be the case that multiple utilities existing in the same space simply defeat the objective of a single source of information, or that those surfacing were competitive rather than consortia-driven exercises. This is a point made by Alan Samuels, Head of Product at global KYC process automation firm, Encompass. “They need to be driven by the data providers rather than third-parties,” he suggests. “Successful utilities arise only when industry participants work together.”</p>
<p>Samuels argues that “trying to boil the ocean by offering a global KYC solution”, when most banks and organisations are more regionalised, seems not to work for utilities (SWIFT notwithstanding). There is a clue to a possible template for success here: Encompass is part of Invidem, a KYC utility set up by a coalition of six Nordic banks in 2019, having found a way of encouraging regional KYC stakeholders to willingly participate. If others follow, a ‘network of networks’ model could cross the globe.</p>
<p>“Ultimately successful utilities are a mix of push and pull,” says Samuels. “Push comes from the regulators, maintaining standards, enforcing good practice and instilling discipline. But pull must come from the industry, working together and seeing the value in collaboration.”</p>
<h4 id="""">Pain continues</h4>
<p>But KYC has always been a slow process. In the past, governments would release lists of sanctioned entities and compliance teams would manually check new customers to make sure there were no matches. And despite the digital revolution, the process remains repetitive, lengthy and cumbersome.</p>
<p>Research has shown that it takes an average of 24 days for a company to complete a bank’s customer onboarding process. This delay is due to “poor data management”, states Masquelier, adding that the data required by financial institutions from corporates is “often incomplete, out of date and held in multiple databases”. It’s why even an existing bank customer can receive multiple KYC requests from different divisions.</p>
<p>The absence of uniformity, differing jurisdictional requirements and the lack of standardised data across the corporate KYC space puts pressure on the relationship between banks and their corporate clients. Treasury teams have naturally been at the centre of this maelstrom – confronted with demands from multiple global bankers across geographies, they have often had to scramble to update their corporate identity information, authorised signatories list and legal entity documents.</p>
<p>“In many cases, they have been asked to supply new information at a far more granular level of detail than ever before,” observes Manoj Mistry, Managing Director of IBOS (or the ‘International Banking – One Solution’ Banking Association), the trade organisation of global correspondent banking service providers. “Faced with losing valuable access to banking services, the degree of exigent coordination across an organisation to obtain current and consistent information has created a sizable burden among treasurers and their staff.”</p>
<p>Relatedly, the information burden for correspondent banking relationships is perhaps the most onerous. Use of previously ‘standard’ information is now by and large negated, with Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) rules now superseding past regulations, and bankers asking for a ‘global minimum’ standard EDD information that is substantially more critical and inquisitive about client relationships. “In order to supply this level of data, and to keep it refreshed on a periodic annual basis, it has created additional complex and time-intensive workload for smaller corporate teams,” he comments.</p>
<p>It’s true also that greater digitisation in the global payment systems has created a new responsibility for real-time authorisations from treasury. “Whilst in the past, large money transfers and payments were covered under the KYC master file, recently, many banks are requiring individual authorisations even for regular payments (such as monthly vendor invoices),” notes Mistry.</p>
<p>This is especially onerous for payments destined for regions under some type of sanction. Indeed, if one part of a global organisation needs to maintain a legitimate payments relationship with businesses in a sanctioned country, that relationship can create additional risk in the overall global banking relationship, and in so doing, increase the frequency and depth of informational refresh.</p>
<p>But with banks currently using a mix of internal and vendor tools, “getting them to agree on a single solution is like herding cats,” states Mistry. Perhaps most challenging of all though, he believes, is the ability of anyone to monitor global regulatory developments and then create a ‘global minimum standard’ that banks and regulators can agree on, and which corporates can support.</p>
<p>The failure of the KYC utility model so far, he notes, is in part driven by a “low willingness” among current data vendors to agree on a pricing schema to contribute their data to a portal partnership. But he also sees a lack of enthusiasm for (and maybe high cost-sensitivity to) creating comprehensive current-ownership and structure information around private companies.</p>
<p>Whilst Bureau van Dijk (part of Moody’s) has good coverage of EU private companies, “that’s about it,” notes Mistry. “The Americas and ROW remain a ‘Wild West’, with 100% reliance on what private companies claim is true – no independent verification is possible.” J.P. Morgan’s Trivedi further observes a general corporate resistance to uploading relatively sensitive data into a third-party source, many citing data privacy and security as a concern.</p>
<h4 id="""">Personal pain</h4>
<p>Praveen Juyal, Treasury Manager, Amway India Enterprises, has first-hand experience of what KYC compliance is like from the corporate side. Whilst he accepts that KYC has a vital role to play, he says the main pain-point for him, as a treasurer, is process efficiency.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The forum we created when trialling our KYC Registry enabled corporates to understand why banks ask for certain types of information, and for banks to reflect on the questions they are asking, and to assess whether opportunities exist for harmonisation through global standards.<br/>
</p></blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">Delphine Masquelier, Product Manager KYC Compliance Services, SWIFT</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>To illustrate his point, he reflects on a recent event. “I have exchanged 20 emails with one of our banks on this KYC. The bank wants the signature of the customers but I have told them many times that all are working from home, and that it’s difficult to get signatures at present, considering the situation with COVID-19, but the bank is still not satisfied.”</p>
<p>His ongoing frustration is palpable. “We have 15 signatories and 12 banks in our system. Every year we need to provide KYC, and it’s a pain to do it again and again for the same person. Really, how often is there a change in human behaviour and in their signatures? Do they change every year? The answer seems to be ‘yes’ since we are obliged to repeat KYC every year.”</p>
<p>The various KYC utilities offered to date have largely failed, he believes, because the pain of responding to KYC is not taken seriously. His one possible solution is that unless there is a change in circumstances for the client, banks and FIs should not repeatedly ask for KYC confirmations but instead take an annual declaration that there is no change in previous KYC status.</p>
<p>Ideally, Juyal sees a digital repository with unique reference number, as the longer-term answer. “If anyone wants it, just give that reference number and you are done.” That number could operate in much the same way a Director Identification Number, but using data masking for more security.</p>
<p>In the meantime, he suggests other treasurers could make life easier for themselves by taking a relatively simple action. “Make at least five printouts of KYC documentation, get them signed immediately by the respective authorised signatories, and make your own ‘repository’,” he suggests. “Every year, whenever necessary, just take one copy as required and provide it to your banks. That way you can save your time for five years if there is no change in signatories.”</p>
<p>That the process is still excruciating for most treasurers raises some key questions for Juyal. “I would like to understand if we are seriously looking for KYC, or if what we are doing is merely to comply with the requirements? Also I’d like to know why, if there is a proper system in place to check KYC, are there still frauds in businesses, banks or financial institutions?”</p>
<p>For him, the overarching purpose of KYC requests should be made clear by those that require it: “By all means ‘Know Your Customer’ but please don’t ‘Knot Your Customer’ with this pain”.</p>
<h4 id="""">Way forward</h4>
<p>One practical solution to the pain felt by the likes of Juyal, suggests Samuels, is leveraging the technology “which is now getting ahead of the demands of regulation”, automation helping organisations increase the productivity and effectiveness of the existing team. “As regulation becomes more demanding, it’s in every organisation’s best interest to make sure it has collected and aggregated all the available information, even from public sources.”</p>
<p>For Mistry, global corporates should make greater investment in the internal talent and skillset which could conduct surveillance on the latest regulatory updates, and then develop effective responses. “In many large corporates today, these services are outsourced to external legal firms, which have proven to not always be the best option when it comes to defining business-prudent solutions to complex regulatory requirements.” Internally keeping data accurate and easily accessible offers considerable pain relief.</p>
<p>Corporates (as well as other legal entity types) should also consider providing their banks with a Legal Entity Identifier (LEI – an ISO standard 20-character code). “It provides a tremendous uplift in our dataset,” says Trivedi. Centrally stored LEIs allow banks to pre-populate a number of KYC fields.</p>
<p>It also helps if corporates publish – and keep updated – KYC-relevant data through providers such as SWIFT, IHS Markit, and other KYC utility platforms, he adds. “And if there is no appetite to cover every legal entity in the group, at least know the ones that constantly require updating and keep those current.”</p>
<p>Banks have a role to play too, individually and en masse. “We need to make sure we have a well-defined and finite set of informational elements that we request from clients. We can do that by sourcing data from public sources, including existing KYC repositories, but where we have deep relationships with our clients, we will often already have a lot of information that we can source, eliminating the need to ask.”</p>
<p>But Trivedi acknowledges that banks should also be creating more efficient channels through which they collect data and documents pertaining to KYC, onboarding, and other relevant areas. “As an industry, the majority of our information exchange with clients is via email. Clients are becoming more sensitive to this and are looking for more efficient and secure ways to exchange information and as institutions we should provide improved capabilities.”</p>
<p>At a regulatory level, there is a growing case to be made for large corporates to exercise their substantial jurisdictional public policy lobby capabilities, “positively influencing the development of regulations”, suggests Mistry. “This could be in collaboration with banking partners or industry associations.”</p>
<p>Whilst much of the recent policy updates governing KYC and AML have focused on mitigating emerging risks from ‘bad actors’, he feels providing greater strength to regional regulatory bodies to impose sanctions on member banks has an unintended consequence. Indeed, in many instances, more stringent local interpretations of the actual risk and its related policy mandate have created an even greater burden among corporates and their banking partners to profitably comply with the regulations.</p>
<p>A specific case for lobbying he therefore suggests would be for global corporates to earn KYC relief for legal entities – even privately-held entities within a corporate group – that are 100% directly owned and controlled by a publicly-traded parent organisation.</p>
<h4 id="""">Promising engagement</h4>
<p>For Masquelier, on the regional utility front, she says the first thing to note is that they were created to meet the local needs of smaller, regional institutions. “This approach cannot solve the full problem on its own,” she states. For her, solving KYC is about getting the right industry dynamics and the right support from banks, corporates and regulators.</p>
<p>Once the correct industry dynamics are in place, fintechs can step in to solve some specific problems in areas like identity management, pattern detection and information sourcing, for example, she believes. It also becomes feasible for local registries to be integrated with a more globally focused registry so that banks and corporates can receive and provide all the information they need in one place.</p>
<p>“But if financial institutions and corporates were only to consider their own individual needs and what works for them, solving the challenges around KYC would be nearly impossible,” argues Masquelier. The future therefore must be about collaboration.</p>
<p>From SWIFT’s engagement with both parties in opening its KYC Registry (its global platform of predefined KYC data fields and document types) to corporates in 2019, it became clear that financial institutions and corporates alike recognise KYC as a necessity, and that both are keen to collaborate to create a solution that works for all parties involved.</p>
<p>“The forum we created when trialling our KYC Registry enabled corporates to understand why banks ask for certain types of information, and for banks to reflect on the questions they are asking, and to assess whether opportunities exist for harmonisation through global standards,” she comments.</p>
<p>As an active participant, Trivedi says J.P. Morgan has noticed many more requests coming from its non-bank clients who are keen to participate in a platform enabling them to publish standardised common KYC data and documentation, consumable by banks “in a more systemic fashion” (the more localised requirements being handled by the banking sector’s aim to streamline data requirements and be more proactive with its collection processes).</p>
<p>“If this engagement has revealed anything,” Masquelier continues, “it’s that there is real appetite for collaboration across the industry, and by harnessing this, the industry is on the right track to building a KYC solution that works for banks and corporates together.”</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>There’s a common misconception that sanctions are only an issue for terrorists or dictator-run countries. The reality is that sanctions are a very real threat to both banks and corporations across the globe. However, corporate awareness of this issue is somewhat patchy: data analysed during a webinar hosted by Bottomline, Break the Chain of Financial Crime, showed that only 30% of respondents believe that the responsibility for implementing sanctions screening rests not just with the banks, but corporates as well. Meanwhile, 71% believe that the entities most impacted by anti-money laundering regulations are banks, not corporates.</p>
<p>The 9/11 attacks had an enormous impact on the global financial regulatory environment, reshaping it in such a way that raised the risk for banks and other institutions ‘engaged in suspicious activity’ – unknowingly or not. Designed to reduce the risk of terrorist financing, suspicion – not necessarily any evidence – was all that was required for the US Treasury to designate foreign jurisdictions and institutions as “primary money laundering concerns” under the Patriot Act. The global reliance on the US dollar meant that these changes were felt far and wide.</p>
<p>While countries are imposing sanctions at increasing rates, they rarely align with each other. The main example of this is the US re-imposing sanctions on Iran after withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). In response, the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges (INSTEX) was created: a special purpose vehicle to facilitate non-USD and non-SWIFT transactions to allow EU member states to trade with Iran without breaking US sanctions. As a result of this increase in sanctions, as well as the focus on ultimate beneficial owners (UBOs), there is a mounting risk of falling foul of them somewhere in the world – even accidentally.</p>
<h4 id=""treasury-and-sanctions"">Treasury and sanctions</h4>
<p>The role of treasury in sanctions screening has become more important as it has become evident that companies can no longer rely solely on banks’ screening technology to manage their sanctions risk. Just in November 2018, French bank Societe Generale agreed to pay US$1.34bn in fines to the US federal and state authorities for handling USD transfers in OFAC-sanctioned countries. Organisations therefore need to be proactive in their own checks as well.</p>
<p>As the people responsible for issuing payments, treasurers must have an active role in sanctions screening, deciding what exactly to screen – be it customers, vendors or partners. Companies must also be aware of other regulations, for example the OFAC/EU 50% rule – if more than 50% of a company or entity is owned by sanctioned individuals (eg it can be three sanctioned persons who each own 20%) it becomes a sanctioned entity itself. In addition, Pierrot Christophe, Treasury Controller Global Business Services, General Electric, notes that companies must also ensure they are continually screening their current customers, as sanctions lists change almost daily.</p>
<p>For Christophe, a major help was integrating the sanctions screening tools into the company’s treasury management system (TMS). “To be effective, everything has to be properly automated as much as it can,” he says. By embedding any sanctions frameworks into the TMS – which has the capability to send and receive funding payments – any suspicious transactions can be flagged immediately, “whether it’s the beneficiary, the country, or any other screening processes that we’re doing on an automated basis.” Similarly, he adds, it is helpful to have the capability to enter into the system that no payments are to be made to, say, North Korea – meaning that if someone tried to enter a customer from North Korea, the system would automatically reject it.</p>
<p>Other companies rely on third-party screening programmes instead of integrating screening into a TMS. Toby Shore, Senior Director, Group Treasury, Risk and Insurance at Emirates Global Aluminium (EGA), explains how he uses such a system at EGA for screening companies, as well as using country screening capabilities within the ERP.</p>
<p>The first step for onboarding new customers or vendors, Shore says, is running a compliance check, starting with a know your customer (KYC) or a know your supplier (KYS) form. “These look to identify, amongst others, A) the company name, and B) the ultimate beneficiaries of the company, directors and senior management,” he explains.</p>
<h4 id=""the-cost-of-getting-it-wrong"">The cost of getting it wrong</h4>
<p>Many know that several banks have recently incurred heavy fines for breaching sanctions. Most recently, Standard Chartered was ordered to pay US$1.1bn by US and UK authorities for breaching sanctions against Iran, Burma, Zimbabwe, Cuba, Sudan, and Syria between 2009 and 2014.</p>
<p>For businesses, says Christophe, the cost of getting it wrong is often dependent on where the company exists and where the breach takes place, but in some places there could be criminal or civil convictions for both the company and the individual responsible. And then of course, there are internal consequences for the individual, including anything up to termination of employment.</p>
<p>“It’s not a single point of failure, this is a proper team effort with clients,” says Adrian Rigby, Chief Operating Officer, Global Trade Finance, HSBC. “Corporates have their own responsibilities to ensure they deal with known parties and individuals and ensure that they operate within that. Anything routed through our organisation, we have a responsibility to back that up with additional and very robust checks as well.”</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not just legal ramifications that businesses and banks face, but reputational ones too. There is the risk of losing both current and future business, as customers look to use companies that seem safer. If by chance something does manage to slip through the net, “the best course of action is to disclose and then explain what the circumstances were,” says Shore.</p>
<h4 id=""challenges-in-numbers"">Challenges in numbers</h4>
<p>For many organisations, the main challenge is the sheer number of sanctions lists. In an ideal world there would be just one list, says Shahrokh Moinian, Head of EMEA Wholesale Payments at J.P. Morgan. Unfortunately, this isn’t the case, and with businesses operating all over the world with various subsidiaries, treasurers have to be aware of all lists and the various risks that come with them.</p>
<p>Christophe agrees. “If we are a global corporation and not just running in, say, the US, we have to make sure that we have access to a global list from different countries.”</p>
<p>Another challenge with the number of lists, according to Shore, is that they are “not always complimentary to one another, nor do they cover the same sort of things.” The number of lists, and the number of names on each list, creates the added challenge of how to handle false positives.</p>
<h4 id=""false-positive-or-genuine-hit"">False positive or genuine hit?</h4>
<p>According to the 2017 Dow Jones &amp; SWIFT Global Anti-Money Laundering Survey, it takes an average of 16 minutes to clear a false positive. Sixteen minutes isn’t an especially long time on its own, but 28% of the respondents said that over 75% of their total alerts were false positives. Now multiply that by the hundreds and thousands of alerts that some companies have per day, and it’s easy to see how it can become a full-time job.</p>
<p>An example of one false positive that often crops up is any company name that includes the words “hair and nail” – owing to the existence of the word “Iran” in the middle of it (haIR ANd nail). Whilst it’s always better to have a slightly overzealous system to ensure nothing slips through the net, companies must then have a way of resolving the false positives in a timely manner. Moinian believes that artificial intelligence could be utilised to help with this and reduce the number of hours spent investigating false positive hits.</p>
<p>Rigby notes that false positives don’t just take a lot of time for the staff investigating them, they also have an impact on customers that have no link to sanctions. “We have a responsibility as a financial institution to screen against sanctions as well as AML and fraud, and we are doing that to protect our customers,” Rigby says. He adds that the bank needs to have effective controls in place – but these need to focus on the real risk and not on the false positive activity.</p>
<p>Regionally though, there are other complications that come with false positives. Based in Dubai, Shore states that the spelling of people’s names is the biggest challenge that he has found as there are a number of local and regional grammatical nuances. “Either the sanctions lists or our records may not have people’s full details, or the details may be very similar – the equivalent of ‘John Smith’ or ‘Peter Adams’ – and you get a false positive,” he says.</p>
<h4 id=""experts-wanted"">Experts wanted</h4>
<p>“The other challenge is you have to have an expert,” says Christophe. This could mean using a group of employees, rather than hiring someone specific, but there must be at least one person who understands what they’re looking for, who can “read the process, read the false positives and make a decision.”</p>
<p>Key to having an expert is of course, to train them and build their confidence. “No one wants to have their name associated to a payment like that,” notes Christophe, so training and creating the confidence to make those decisions is an important hurdle to overcome.</p>
<h4 id=""how-to-get-it-right"">How to get it right</h4>
<p>It’s widely agreed that additional information is required both on sanctions lists and when inputting new customer/client data to help combat the issue of false positives. Additional information allows for more data to be compared against the sanctions lists, meaning any matches will be more likely to be a genuine positive. For example, ‘John Smith’ could produce hundreds of matches, but inputting John Albert Smith, born on 1st December 1970 in New York, would significantly narrow it down.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones &amp; SWIFT survey found that 71% of respondents reported that their companies include additional names of people, companies and organisations as additional information, 67% used entities controlled/owned by other sanctioned countries, and 66% used entities linked to sanctioned jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Alongside additional information from the screening, companies also need to use secondary identifiers to reduce false positives. In total, 96% of respondents used secondary identifiers, with 80% using date of birth, 59% using country of birth and 48% using gender.</p>
<h4 id=""safety-in-numbers"">Safety in numbers</h4>
<p>A fan of a solid two-step process, Christophe believes that the most effective way to ensure compliance is to have an internal process that is integrated into the TMS, as well as having a third-party programme as a secondary checker. It is essential, he says, that the treasury team works to understand the system and ensures that the user access is there and available. “We have to make sure that there’s segregation of duties, there’s immediate validation, there’s some sort of supervisory process, and so on.”</p>
<p>Like Christophe, Rigby’s belief that there should be no single point of failure holds true for remaining compliant as well. “You need to have appropriate layers of control,” he says. It’s a corporate’s responsibility to ensure that they deal with appropriate counterparties and locations, and everything else that’s within sanctions, he adds. As a bank, “we’re there to work with them in terms of what we see.”</p>
<p>For Shore, the most effective way to ensure EGA remains compliant is to hold regular information sessions. “Not just with the treasury team, but with our marketing and sales and procurement teams,” he says. It’s important to reinforce exactly what the ramifications are of breaking a sanctions clause, and educating people on the expected processes. “People have busy jobs and may see this as a ‘nice to have’ rather than a necessity for doing business and the training and education reinforces the importance of the process,” he adds.</p>
<p>With human error one of the most significant risks, it’s important that every step possible is taken to reduce it. And that means “putting the responsibility back onto the business, to make sure that they understand what the requirements are, and that they are abiding by them.”</p>
<h4 id=""utilising-technology"">Utilising technology</h4>
<p>As many treasurers that deal with KYC issues know, a standardised solution would be ideal. Moinian thinks that in the absence of this, technology can play an important role in resolving issues related to payments delayed for sanction screening reasons. He describes the Interbank Information Network (IIN) platform that J.P. Morgan has created, which uses blockchain technology to enable member banks to exchange information in real-time and reduce friction in the payments process. Moinian notes that with a network of more than 380 banks, IIN continues to grow and evolve. More than 80 are now live and the onboarding process for others is happening quickly. There are discussions, Moinian says, of participant banks developing their own solutions for possible use across the network too.</p>
<p>Christophe understands that sanctions screening is an ongoing process, and the automated programmes for sanctions screening are still not perfect and therefore need human supervision. “Are there people reviewing and auditing the process, and spot checking to make sure nothing slips through the cracks?” he says. “Is there a process to review it? When in doubt, are we hiring management not just to make decisions, but to be aware of what’s going on? To be aware of if we’re running at 90% effective, or are we running at 80% effective? Are we just getting lucky?”</p>
<p>Christophe expects the existing process to improve with time, but also recognises that time will bring new challenges. Treasurers aren’t just having to think about how to solve their current problems, but future ones too.</p>
<h4 id=""doing-the-best-you-can"">Doing the best you can</h4>
<p>Due diligence is something that all can agree is one of the most important factors in remaining compliant with sanctions. Shore notes that having an internal system is important for initial due diligence checks, but that it’s also essential to have periodic checks by the compliance team to manually cross-match a company’s records with sanctions lists.</p>
<p>Ultimately though, Shore believes that by providing an effective framework and system alongside the necessary training and education for all involved, “then that’s as robust a defence as we can reasonably put in place.”</p>


","Recently it seems to be the case that sanctions are being handed out like presents in the holidays – except they’re far less pleasant than a new pair of socks. As of November 2019, the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)’s consolidated sanctions list included over 8,900 entities – more than four times the number of any other sanctioning body.

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Regulations are paramount. Regardless of your seniority or experience, if you are not up to date with the relevant regulations, you are at risk of providing incorrect advice to your clients (internal or external). This principle rings particularly true in the corporate treasury and banking space in Asia Pacific, where there are constant regulatory updates.</p>
<p>Indeed, the frequency of regulatory change across Asia is so high, and variation in rulebooks between countries so marked, that as a region it presents treasurers with special challenges versus other geographies. How can APAC-focused treasurers ensure that their regulatory knowledge is consistently topped up so that they are able to assess the impact of changes on their organisations and develop appropriate responses?</p>
<p>Subscribing to circulars from regulators is a must. Regulators provide frequent updates and are the most reliable source. Signing up for news and circular alerts from the relevant regulators vie email is simple and effective and an essential first step in ensuring a solid platform for dealing with ever changing rulebooks.</p>
<p>Materials and online services from law firms can be very valuable. Various law firms often provide useful regulatory intelligence in the form of alerts, newsletters, client briefings or host talks that summarise and interpret the updated regulatory position covering various jurisdictions. Their interpretations are often informed by their own participation in consultations with their respective local regulators, industry groups or clients. These materials and talks provide an inside view into developments in local regulations.</p>
<p>International firms, such as Clifford Chance, also operate comprehensive online portals which provide access to thought leadership publications on a cross jurisdictional basis, reflecting timely insight and views on various regulatory topics.</p>
<p>Keeping all the circulars and materials in one place is highly advisable. A practical tip on this front would be to keep a depositary of all the circulars, published materials and updates (by topic) you receive from regulators and law firms. We all know how cluttered an email inbox can get, and keeping a centralised database containing all these updates will make your life much easier when you need to revisit these materials.</p>
<p>Engagement with industry bodies can be very fruitful. We advise treasurers to try to get involved with the various bodies that are active in the industry, whether this be in a formal, consultative process or in a more informal, social context. Either way, you will get valuable insights into what these bodies (including peers within these bodies) think about the current regulatory landscape and upcoming regulated changes.</p>
<p>Lastly, always try and make time for regulatory consultations as they are issued. Looking out for and then engaging with regulatory consultations will really help you anticipate any regulatory changes and prevents you from being wrong-footed by any new regulations that may be in the pipeline.</p>
<p>These are the main tried-and-true methods to keep one consistently updated of, and prepared for, the ever-changing regulatory landscape of Asia Pacific and beyond.</p>

<p>New currency rules in Thailand, extended cut-off times for India, and amended reporting requirements in China; such diverse regulatory changes are all in a day’s work for treasurers operating across Asia Pacific.</p>
<p>This region consists of both free and highly regulated markets, some countries are opening up and reducing regulatory barriers while others are tightening or continually changing. The region’s regulatory flux presents treasurers with numerous challenges and they need to be equipped to keep abreast of these changes and prioritise those that may have an immediate impact on day to day operations.</p>
<p>Once identified, it is important to evaluate several methods to manage the regulatory change and select an approach that will minimise disruption and maximise benefits. For example, changes previously put on cash pools limiting liquidity outflows from China led to challenges in managing daily cash pooling of funds cross border into regional pools. This amendment required treasurers to think of alternative liquidity and funding solutions to ensure they were able to fund the business effectively.</p>
<p>Regulatory changes can affect multiple areas of a company’s treasury operations, including financial reporting, liquidity management, commodity risk management and foreign exchange hedging programmes. There are several methods that treasurers can employ to understand the impact of regulations on their business operations.</p>
<p>For countries such as India and China, often the preferred approach is to have local treasury staff on the ground to engage with local regulators and banks and understanding the requirements with respect to completing or filing documentation associated with transaction activity. These local experts are also well positioned to better understand implications and requirements if changes are unclear, which can often be the case in Asia.</p>
<p>Another approach is to ensure treasury nominates a point person to work closely with legal and other operational areas of the business to understand and analyse changes to regulations and how these changes may impact operations. This person would then work with any local business, IT, treasury or finance staff on potential process, technology or reporting changes that may need to be implemented.</p>
<p>Tax advisors, banks, lawyers and big four consultants are also a good source of information. But the challenge then for many treasurers is interpreting the information and how it relates to changes they may need to make to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>Managing regulations is all part of the challenge for treasurers across Asia and the best way to keep up to date is to ensure continuous engagement with banks, advisors and local treasury associations or peer groups to understand the implication of these changes and how they may impact your business.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>In today’s ever-changing regulatory environment across APAC, coping with changes requires a two-step approach. Firstly, treasurers will need to monitor and identify all the relevant current and prospective regulatory changes. Secondly, they need to work with stakeholders to assess how all the relevant changes will affect the organisations’ business model and compliance framework, and thereafter, prioritise the relevant requirements based on the extent of impact and timeline.</p>
<p>To execute the steps above, treasurers should regularly engage with financial institutions and consultants. In many countries within APAC, regulatory changes are often implemented quickly with nil to limited guidance immediately available and varied significantly across different regions and jurisdictions. To navigate through the complexity of these changes, seeking regular compliance updates through first-hand interaction with banks and accredited consultants (and through subscription to their regulatory updates/newsletters) will be important, as regulatory authorities would typically consult or engage these parties in formulating and interpreting these regulations.</p>
<p>Treasurers should also look to form a multi-disciplinary focus group or taskforce within their organisation that monitors and manages regulatory changes holistically. Identifying regulatory changes is not the sole responsibility of the treasurer, instead, it requires collaboration with the other functions within the organisation, including compliance, finance, legal departments, and the management team in the relevant jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Moreover, many of the major regulatory changes in the last 12 to 24 months (such as GDPR, AML/KYC regulations and IFRS 9) have had a pervasive impact on organisations and their effects were not only clearly felt by treasury, with significant impact on many other functions within the organisation. It is therefore critical for treasury to work closely with other functions to ensure that regulatory updates from a broad range of disciplines are appropriately identified and assessed so that all material and relevant changes to the organisation are identified on a timely basis and the organisation is addressing such changes with a comprehensive approach (not siloed).</p>
<p>Treasurers should stay close to the latest regulatory developments and seek best practice from other corporates by attending the most relevant gatherings. Hundreds of business conferences are held each year and attending some can help provide the perfect platform for industry participants to not only obtain technical information but also share information regarding best practice and lessons learnt from addressing these regulatory changes. In addition, speakers at these events can sometimes be members of the regulatory authority, meaning there is an opportunity for treasurers to provide first-hand feedback to the authorities.</p>
<p>Do not underestimate the impact technologies can play in compliance. As noted previously, coping with regulatory changes is a two-step process. Technology plays an important role in the second step by enabling an organisation’s data to be collated and reported in an informative manner that helps assess its compliance readiness and quality of compliance reporting. Whilst it is understandable that treasurers focus on the “nuts and bolts” of the regulatory updates, they should work with their focus group to evaluate whether the organisation’s technology and controls are fit for purpose as regulatory reporting is only as good as the data assembled.</p>

<p><em>Regulators globally have shown financial institutions that violate tough post-crisis compliance rules no mercy and are now, increasingly, showing a determination to also punish corporates that don’t toe the line when it comes to know your customer, anti-money laundering and sanctions.</em></p>
<p>A decade on from the collapse of Lehman Brothers, regulators across the United States, Europe, Asia Pacific and the Middle East have levied an eye-watering US$26bn in monetary penalties against institutions for KYC, AML and sanctions violations, according to one of the most comprehensive studies of its kind since the financial crisis.</p>
<p>The research by US-based Fenergo, a provider of regulatory and compliance solution to banks and corporates, says inadequate customer due diligence procedures and the lack of cohesive, global KYC and AML compliance programmes were the most common charges levelled at penalised institutions. On the sanctions front, penalties were mostly handed out for screening processes that intentionally ignored the status of sanctioned entities.</p>
<p>Published in October, the Fenergo study draws on analyses of ten years of AML and KYC fines and found that at the regional level, the US accounted for over 90% or US$23.5bn of all global AML, KYC and sanctions-related fines between 2008 and 2018.</p>
<p>Europe followed with US$1.7bn issued in fines over the ten-year period. The current year however has already become a record year for AML fines across the region, with a total of US$903m levied, including the highest European AML fine of the past decade, totalling US$900m and levied by Dutch authorities.</p>
<p>Across APAC, AML-related fines totalling US$609m have been issued in the last ten years. As with Europe, fines across the region this year already amount to a new ten-year record, US$540m in penalties issued over the first eight months of the year. “There is a notably intensified appetite from Singapore and Hong Kong financial regulators to safeguard their respective financial systems by bolstering AML, KYC efforts,” says the report.</p>
<p>In the Middle East, meanwhile, regulators are starting to find their regulatory bite in an attempt to fix a global perception of a ‘light touch’ regulatory regime within the region. The Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) has been the most active regulator in the area, levying five fines totalling US$9.5m for AML contraventions.</p>
<p>As for sanctions violations, they accounted for 20% of the US$26bn issued in enforcement penalties globally on financial firms.</p>
<p>With the implementation of new regulations, including EU’s MiFID II and GDPR; and US Treasury’s FinCEN Final Rule relating to customer due diligence (CDD) over the past year alone, the expectation across the financial industry is that regulators will continue to flex their enforcement muscles. Accenture’s 2018 Compliance Risk Study found that nearly 90% of 150 compliance officers surveyed across banking, capital markets and insurance are anticipating their organisations will boost investment in compliance over the next two years.</p>
<h3 id=""warning-for-corporates"">Warning for corporates</h3>
<p>While both the Fenergo and Accenture studies are focused very much on financial institutions, their findings are a powerful signal to corporates that as clients of financial services firms they too will, inevitably, come under greater scrutiny under KYC, AML and sanctions rules.</p>
<p>The sanctions space has been especially lively this year thanks to US President Trump’s willingness to slap new rules on not just countries like Iran, Syria, Russia and North Korea but organisations and individuals as well. Data gathered by US law firm Gibson Dunn earlier this year shows that across the full range of US sanctions programmes, nearly new 1,000 entities and individuals were blacklisted during 2017. That represented a near 30% increase over the number added during President Obama’s last year in office, and a nearly three-fold increase over the number added during Obama’s first year in office.</p>
<p>A notable recent instance of a corporate being snared by US sanctions is Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE, which was charged with “egregious” violations of rules on Iran and North Korea. In May the company was allowed to resume operating in the US but only after paying a US$1.3bn fine. It also had to change its management and board, hire American compliance officers and provide “high-level security guarantees”.</p>
<p>With sanctions rules there is no room for ignorance. Last year PayPal was fined over US$7m for breaking the US Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators Sanctions Regulations after unwittingly processing payments for a sanctioned individual. Elsewhere, US medical company Alcon Labs has been fined more than US$7m for selling medical equipment to customers in Iran and Sudan, and the PanAmerican Seed Company had to cough up US$4.3m for selling flower seeds to Iranian distributors.</p>
<p>Parth Desai, founder and CEO of payment compliance platform Pelican, says that, increasingly, personal executives are being held to account and individually fined by regulators following corporate non-compliance. The negative impact on business reputations of being shamed can be even more significant than the direct financial penalties imposed, he says.</p>
<p>“Despite these risks, there is still a reluctance among some companies to onboard proper sanctions screening processes, with many erroneously believing it is enough for their banks to do all screening,” says Desai. “As many companies have learnt the hard way, there is no excuse the regulators will accept for a failure to put in place adequate systems and processes to ensure all relevant sanctions obligations are adhered to.”</p>
<p>Desai says that while many companies around the world are either planning, implementing or already using sanctions screening and fraud prevention solutions, others are facing either compliance disaster or fraud exposure.</p>
<p>How companies handle their data is no longer simply about compliance – it is a competitive differentiator. Firms that fail to have a cohesive strategy and programme in place will struggle to succeed at best, or create a ticking time bomb at worst, Desai warns, adding: “Action is better than inaction – and complacency can lead to disaster.”</p>
<h3 id=""the-kyc-challenge"">The KYC challenge</h3>
<p>Corporates face many challenges on the KYC front too. A Thomson Reuters global survey of 1,122 decision makers, including treasurers and finance directors in non-financial corporations, found that banks are looking to alleviate some of the regulatory pressure on them by increasing the volume of KYC information they require from companies. An indication of the much tougher regulatory climate for banks is that, according to Fenergo, between 2009 and 2012 alone, more than 50,000 regulations were published across the G20 group of countries, with almost 50,000 regulatory updates rolled out over 2015. Not surprisingly, major financial institutions are spending between US$900m and US$1.3bn a year on financial crime compliance.</p>
<p>The Thomson Reuters study, which surveyed firms in countries including Singapore, Hong Kong, USA, UK, France and Germany, also found that the KYC burden on companies is being magnified by their high number of banking relationships. On average, each corporate surveyed had ten global banking relationships, with bigger organisations having more banking relationships, as many as 14 in some cases. Such multiple banking relationships make managing the provision of KYC documentation to financial counterparties significantly more time-consuming and complex for corporates.</p>
<p>The research furthermore reveals that banks were taking longer to onboard corporate clients who in turn were not passing on a significant proportion of material changes needed for KYC processing. As a result, senior managers within corporates were spending valuable time responding to multiple requests for compliance-related information.</p>
<p>One of the biggest bugbears for corporates is financial institutions’ lack of common KYC standards. As a result, document requests vary by bank and geography, making it difficult for corporates to predict exactly what will be required. Institutions and regulators have shown they are committed to moving towards standardised KYC requirements but there is still an awful long way to go.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Not surprisingly, third-party providers have spotted an opportunity 
to provide KYC solutions that address the needs of all parties. SWIFT 
was one of the first to spot the opening. Its KYC Registry provides 
banks with information on their correspondent and downstream 
relationships in a shared platform that manages and exchanges 
standardised KYC data. Other managed service providers offer more than a
 repository, tailoring in-depth due diligence for banks, investment 
managers and corporates.</p>
<p>Yet the Holy Grail of standardised, automated KYC, is still some way 
off. One reason is that banks still have their own on-boarding methods. 
David Fleet, Managing Director, Client On-boarding and Management at 
Standard Chartered Bank in Singapore explains: “There are still 
requirements for additional data over and above what the utility 
collects.”</p>
<p>And banks cling to their own practices because ultimate KYC 
responsibility remains with them. “The danger is that if the provider 
gets it wrong, the bank remains on the hook. Banks can’t outsource their
 responsibility,” says Tom Devlin, Partner at law firm Stephen Platt 
&amp; Associates. Competition amongst banks is also a factor impeding 
collaboration. Similarly, the proliferation of competitive KYC services 
chasing the same segment reduces the chance of industry-wide standards.</p>
<p>Some experts believe that only when regulators deliberately specify 
clear KYC parameters and requirements, will shared platforms or 
‘one-stop-shops’ really work. “Regulators refuse to tell banks what 
constitutes adequate KYC and banks continue to dream up more and more 
ridiculous KYC criteria for their clients,” says David Blair, Managing 
Director of Singapore-based Acarate Consulting.</p>
<h3 id=""blockchain-to-the-rescue"">Blockchain to the rescue?</h3>
<p>With little sign of a resolution any time soon to the conflicting 
demands and priorities of financial institutions and corporates when it 
comes to KYC, interest is growing in blockchain technology as a 
potential solution. As an immutable shared digital ledger of 
transactions maintained by a network of computers rather than a 
centralised authority, blockchain could be used to safely store and 
share validated data such as KYC documentation amongst banks. Such a 
facility could help remove the need for duplication of information and 
enable updates to client details on the KYC ledger to be made available 
to all banks in close to real time. The ledger could also provide a 
historical record of all documents shared and compliance activities 
undertaken for each client, addressing the needs of the regulator.</p>
<p>Efforts to explore the application of blockchain to KYC have 
intensified over the last two years. And while any commercial 
exploitation of the technology for KYC remains some way off, there have 
been some notable advances. Last year, for instance, the R3 blockchain 
consortium reported that more than three dozen of its members – 
including BNP Paribas, China Merchants Bank and Deutsche Bank – had 
carried out a global trial of a KYC application built on a blockchain 
platform.</p>
<p>The four-day trial saw 39 firms carry out over 300 transactions in 19
 countries across eight time zones. Banks were able to request access to
 customer KYC test data, whilst customers could approve requests and 
revoke access. Customers were also able to update their test data which 
was then automatically updated for all banks with permission to access 
it.</p>
<p>R3 says the system reduces duplication and costs by eliminating the 
need for each institution to individually attest and update KYC records.
 And, because only those with a need to see data have access to it, 
there are no data privacy and security issues.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, KPMG in Singapore has worked with a consortium of three 
banks in Singapore – HSBC, OCBC, and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group – as
 well as the Singaporean regulator Info-communications Media Development
 Authority to develop a proof-of-concept KYC utility on a blockchain 
platform. The prototype successfully passed the Monetary Authority of 
Singapore’s test scenarios. In addition to stability, efficiency and 
security, the platform could, says KPMG, result in estimated cost 
savings of 25%-50% by reducing duplication and providing a clear audit 
trail.</p>
<p>IT giant IBM meanwhile has been working with banks around the world 
on early stage shared KYC projects based on blockchain. Earlier this 
year it announced successful completion of a proof of concept KYC 
blockchain platform in collaboration with Deutsche Bank and HSBC.</p>
<p>Although the cost of KYC is a huge part of the motivation for sharing
 KYC information across banks securely, for IBM the customer experience 
is an even bigger factor: “Banking clients are constantly asked to 
provide the same information, over and over again. For corporations, 
this can be very tedious, given the amount of certified information and 
documents they need to provide. By sharing KYC information across banks,
 the burden can be reduced, translating to faster onboarding and less 
work for customers.”</p>
<p>IBM believes one of the key aspects of blockchain that fits well with
 these objectives is its ability to allow the customer – individual or 
corporate – to dictate with whom they want to share information and for 
what purpose, without needing the banks to be involved in the middle. 
Those types of capabilities are very difficult to achieve without using 
blockchain technology, it says.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In less than four years, China’s asset management industry has doubled in size to over US$15trn, approximately equivalent to China’s overall GDP.</p>
<p>The growth of the industry was originally triggered by financial and interest rate liberalisation, which has encouraged significant financial innovation. However, the recent, rapid development in shadow banking products is driven by less desirable factors including regulatory arbitrage, implicit guarantees and opaque, complex products which are designed to circumvent central bank-imposed regulations in order to provide borrowers with access to credit, while also providing investors with higher-yielding products. The asset management sector has thereby served the real economy and fuelled much of China’s recent economic development.</p>
<p>The asset management industry’s boom has also created risks in the Chinese economy, however. Most notably, indebtedness in China has quadrupled since 2008. This has seen China’s debt-to-GDP levels skyrocket to 266% at the end of last year. Whilst this figure is comparable to that of the US, UK and Japan, it is significantly higher than other emerging market economies and the speed of growth appears unsustainable, translating into concerns that a financial crisis may be brewing.</p>
<h3 id=""taking-action"">Taking action</h3>
<p>The systemic risk that this credit growth poses to the Chinese economy is recognised by the country’s government, which has made deleveraging a key objective in order to de-risk the economy and create financial stability. China’s regulators have already introduced several new rules, including measures adopted last year by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) to strengthen the mutual fund industry (which equates to 10% of China’s entire asset management industry) and new macro-prudential rules by the People Bank of China (PBoC) to reduce bank risks.</p>
<p>Now the remaining 90% of the asset management industry, which Aidan Shevlin, Managing Director, Head of Asia Pacific Liquidity Fund Management at J.P. Morgan Asset Management describes as containing “less desirable financial activity”, is to be curtailed. This is after rules introduced by the Financial Stability and Development Committee – a ‘super regulator’ designed to unify the rules covering the entire asset management industry – were signed into law in April.</p>
<h3 id=""under-the-spotlight"">Under the spotlight</h3>
<p>Titled ‘The Guiding Opinion on Regulations in the Asset Management Business of Financial Institutions’, the rules seek to curb financial risks and enhance investor protection. The headline change is that existing investment products sold by the asset management industry, such as trust products and wealth management products (WMPs), will be unified under a single product umbrella: the Asset Management Product (AMP).</p>
<p>Publicly sold AMPs must conform with strict rules. For example, these products must no longer provide an implicit or explicit guarantee that an investor’s principal is secure. It is a move that Shevlin believes is positive. “The guarantee that these investment products offered created a dislocation between risk and return in China,” he says. “Removing it will realign the principles of risk and return and force investors to be diligent when making investments – something they haven’t had to be in the past because of the guarantee.”</p>
<p>AMPs must also only invest in ‘standard assets’ – defined by the regulators as assets that have a market price. “This will impact the returns that these funds can offer because the yield of WMPs was often boosted by funds investing in opaque loan structures and using techniques such as layering, which is no longer permitted,” says Shevlin. “But the change will also drastically reduce the risk in these funds, which is a good step for the industry and is what the Chinese regulators are trying to achieve.”</p>
<p>Another rule change is that all AMPs must be mark-to-market, meaning investors will no longer be assured a guaranteed rate of return. “It will drive more transparency in the industry, making it clearer for investors to know what they are buying and what risk they are taking,” says Shevlin.</p>
<p>In an effort to ensure a smooth transition, the Financial Stability and Development Committee has granted a transition period until the end of 2020 for existing products to comply with the new rules. Any new products launched after April 2019 must obey the new rules immediately.</p>
<p>“Extending the transition period to two years is a sensible move, as many existing products have one or two-year maturities,” says Shevlin. “Investors will get their money back and the underlying loans that the product is investing in will be paid off before they transit under the new AMP rules. It is uncertain what will happen to those products that have longer maturity dates, however.”</p>
<h3 id=""market-impact"">Market impact</h3>
<p>The impact that these rules will have on the asset management industry should not be downplayed. Indeed, Shevlin says that the rules will “essentially kill off nearly all the existing investment products used in China today”. So what will happen to all the cash? Shevlin says that some of it will likely flow back into time deposits – and banks have been preparing for this by increasing the rates of return on these products.</p>
<p>Shevlin also expects cash to flow into the ‘traditional’ mutual fund sector – which is not directly impacted by the new rules. “Money market funds, which are already well-regulated and offer good disclosure, are unaffected by the new rules and would appeal to investors focused on liquidity, security and return,” he says.</p>
<p>Whilst this is a boon for the fund management industry, Shevlin notes that fund managers cannot rest on their laurels and that the industry must innovate to retain investor cash. “I hope to see more products launched that cater for the entire risk spectrum,” he says. “This will give investors more choice and play a key role in boosting the sophistication of the investment community in China.”</p>
<p>The new rules are expected to have a negative short-term impact on commercial banks in China. Some banks generate up to 12% of their total revenues issuing WMPs, and this revenue-generating ability will be greatly reduced under the new regulatory regime. What is more, those banks that don’t have a separate asset management subsidiary will now be required to create one in order to conduct asset management business.</p>
<p>Whilst Shevlin expects that those banks with a stronger traditional loan/deposit franchise and capital base will be best placed to withstand the impact of the changes, it is likely that bank funding costs will increase overall, making banks less inclined to provide credit to corporates. This may lead more corporates to the bond market, thus increasing spreads – and possibly resulting in more credit events taking place in China over the coming years.</p>
<p>To alleviate this impact and ensure the banks will fund the real economy, the PBoC cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) in anticipation of the new rules. “This releases some funding back to the banks at no cost,” says Shevlin. “And we expect to see the PBoC continue to do this over the coming year as it adopts a more neutral monetary policy and debt flatlines.”</p>
<h3 id=""next-steps-for-investors"">Next steps for investors</h3>
<p>For corporates in China, particularly those that use guarantee products, changes will be required in terms of how they invest. But Shevlin says that there is no need for panic.</p>
<p>“Corporates that have exclusively used WMPs and trust products need to revisit their investment policies to ensure these are broad-based and flexible,” he says. “This will enable them to invest in suitable products under the new regulatory regime. They also need to think about changing their investment procedures and make sure that they are doing their homework on the products they are buying because of the greater link between risk and return.” Shevlin adds that for western investors that rarely invest in WMPs, the impact on their investments should be minimal.</p>
<p>“That being said, as always it is important to stay close to your fund manager as sudden change is par for the course in China,” he says. “But overall these new rules should be seen as a positive that will reduce systemic risk and moral hazard in China, and help the government achieve its goal of creating sustainable financial stability.”</p>

<br/>
</p>
<p>Over the past decade, the global sanctions landscape has become increasingly complex as various countries and supranational bodies impose sanctions at an unprecedented rate – that very rarely align with each other. This has put all affected organisations in a difficult position, heightening the risk of them falling foul of sanctions somewhere in the world.</p>
<p>More than half of corporates, when polled during a recent webinar hosted by Treasury Today and Thomson Reuters, said they were either ‘not confident’ or ‘very unconfident’ about their knowledge of the current sanctions environment and the impact it is having on their organisation.</p>
<p>Given the complexity of the global sanctions landscape and how “narrative sanctions” are putting the onus on risk managers in the private sector to ensure companies are not falling foul of these rules, the results are unsurprising, said Jesse Spiro, Global Head of Threat Finance &amp; Emerging Risk at Thomson Reuters.</p>
<p>Using sanctions placed on Russia and Iran as case studies, Spiro revealed the myriad complexity that risk managers face when trying to understand the sanctions that apply and whether their organisations and staff fall foul of these.</p>
<p>Indeed, complexity is the watchword when it comes to sanctions. Corporates, it seems, can no longer rely on their banks – and their outdated sanctions screening technology – to manage the risk. Bill North, Head of Global Sales at Pelican provided some practical guidance for corporates looking to put in place their own sanctions screening programme.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of any sanctions screening programme is to prevent a company from undertaking any transaction, or working with any entity or individual, that would see it violate regulations. To that end, North believes that sanctions screening programmes must start with treasury determining precisely what it is going to scan – including customers, vendors, partners, and agents. Treasury will then need to decide what sanctions lists to scan these counterparties against, depending on the type of business it is and the geographies in which it operates.</p>

</figure>
<p>The system must also do this in a streamlined and efficient manner so as not to create any extra work for the treasury team. For example, antiquated systems do not have the sufficient level of sophistication to recognise that a bank branch with the legitimate address of 128 Baghdadstrasse in Berlin is not the same as the sanctioned city of Baghdad in Iraq. The system will, therefore, generate an alert, stop the payment and create more work for the treasury.</p>
<p>Selecting a technology that can best meet these objectives in the most efficient manner is the next step. North suggested that picking a system that understands the context of the payment should be a key driver as this can eliminate the type of issues experienced when sending payments to the aforementioned Baghdadstrasse. Another way to reduce false positives is to leverage AI and machine learning so the system can learn from “clean” transactions and not flag the same data in context twice.</p>

<br/>
</figure>
<p>The technology also needs to detail clearly why it has created an alert. North explained that best in class technology should be able to offer a single view of the data or text that caused the alert and the source of conflict. This will dramatically shorten the time taken to start the remediation process.</p>
<p>Furthermore, North argued that treasurers need to think about adopting a system that integrates with existing systems and processes easily. He added that treasury should not have to change a payment file in any way to be able to scan it, and that the system should be flexible to enable users to choose at what point in the process they want to do the scanning.</p>

<h4 id=""tony-kinnear"">Tony Kinnear, Managing Director, ASEAN and North Asia, Thomson Reuters:</h4>
<p>The US Republican government led by President Trump has arguably ushered in the biggest tax reform in US history, and its ramifications extend way beyond the US. As a part of the tax reforms under the ‘Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017’, the United States will:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Reduce its corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and reduce or eliminate other related deductions and credits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eliminate corporate alternative minimum tax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change the US tax system from global to territorial with respect to corporate income tax.</p>
<p> </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Following these reforms, corporations in Asia – whether they be a holding company, a subsidiary or a permanent establishment with a presence in the US – will need to review their tax structures to ascertain the impact of the reforms. Here are a few things corporations in Asia might consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For Asian corporations with US links, it will be important to review their transfer pricing structures. Relevant US reform measures include the new anti-deferral tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) and the new base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT) on outbound related-party payments. Coming hard on the heels of the BEPS measures and the compliance processes they mandate, the US reforms will keep many corporations very busy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reforms also allow US corporations a 100% deduction for foreign-sourced dividends received from foreign corporations which are owned at least 10% by the US company. This applies to dividend distributions made after December 31<sup>st</sup> 2018. Asia Pacific companies that fit the 10% ownership rule may see some pressure to pay dividends if the US parent is seeking that 100% deduction. This will, however, be a case-by-case situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The value of unused tax losses for the Asia corporations could also be impacted as a result of the US reforms. When a re-measurement of deferred tax balances arising from a change in the relevant tax rate is done, the amount of the change will be recognised through income tax expense, unless the deferred tax relates to an item recognised directly in equity (for example, movements in an asset revaluation reserve).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Post the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) implementation, Asian corporations will have to pay particular attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The interest expense limitation to 30% of adjusted taxable income (tax EBITDA for tax years beginning on or after January 1<sup>st</sup> 2018).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The base erosion minimum tax measures – these apply to taxpayers with US gross receipts exceeding US$500m and are calculated on income modified to add back certain deductible payments made to foreign related parties (5% for tax years beginning on or after January 1<sup>st</sup> 2018, increasing to 10% until December 31<sup>st</sup> 2025 and then to 12.5%).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The allowance of immediate 100% expensing of qualified property for five years purchased after September 27<sup>th</sup> 2017 and before December 31<sup>st</sup> 2022. This could provide significant tax benefits where applicable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Lastly, Asian corporations must be cognisant that lower tax rates may make the United States an attractive investment destination and create a strong pull for American corporations to repatriate funds from other economies where companies are taxed at a higher rate. This might pose a challenge to Asia’s competitive position at a time when labour costs in the region are already rising. However, owing to the reduced tax rates, this reform may also present an opportunity for Asian corporations to make new or enhanced direct investment into the US market and deploy more cash into the US market.</p>
<p>The practical implications of the US tax reforms will take some time to for corporations to properly work through. If they have not started already, the time to start is now.</p>

<h4 id=""sandip-patil"">Sandip Patil, Asia Pacific Global Liquidity and Investments Head, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi:</h4>
<p>The US tax reform is one of the biggest tax regulation changes we have seen in a long time. In addition to lowering tax rates, it brings fundamental changes including moving to a territorial tax system, Base Erosion Provisions (BEAT) and Tax on Global Intangible income (GILTI). This presents a unique set of opportunities for companies in Asia – for both US companies based in the region as well as Asian companies operating in the US.</p>
<p>For US subsidiaries in Asia, this presents a unique opportunity in the long term for clients to revisit their legal entity and vehicle structures. As a consideration to the potential impact of BEAT provisions to high value services, US corporates should review restructuring intercompany recharging mechanisms for treasury and shared services, inter-company funding and trading structures, as well as potentially establish/revise the scope of their regional treasury centres or in-house banks.</p>
<p>In the short term, most companies are reviewing the remittance of historic retained earnings back to the US. As US companies in Asia still have operations and significant business presence, we do not expect any immediate action or material USD liquidity shifts from Asia to US as a consequence.</p>
<p>While cash and cash equivalent retained earnings are estimated at US$1trn internationally, less than one-third of this is estimated to be in Asia. As such, we do not estimate significant shifts given the growth potential in Asia, irregularities of working capital funding, regulatory nature of markets as well as wider manufacturing operations.</p>
<p>However, it does provide an ongoing window for companies to remit longer duration surplus back to headquarters. Another factor impacting these decisions is the need for liquidity at HQ in terms of retiring debt or capex or stock buybacks. Corporate restructuring opportunities will drive the broader direction but without material impact to Asian foreign exchange markets.</p>
<p>As the largest bank for US companies in Asia, we continue to work very closely with our clients, guide them on specific aspects of their evaluation as well as connect the thought process with their headquarters.</p>
<p>Similarly, for Asian companies operating in the US, we continue to help them operationalise their cash management strategy in the US and work with their headquarters in Asia to streamline inter-company transactions by providing them with structured solutions around their specific needs. We do anticipate the direction and enablement of these companies achieving increased self-sufficiency of vehicles operating in US.</p>
<p>Overall, we expect these tax changes to provide fundamental restructuring opportunity for our clients’ global business.</p>

<h4 id=""pwc-singapore"">Allison Cheung, International Tax Partner and Nikki Mullins, Senior Manager, PwC Singapore:</h4>
<p>As multinational businesses evaluate opportunities (both regionally and globally) to position their operations for success, a key consideration is to assess the impact of US tax reform on treasury departments. As such, modelling the impact of US tax reform is pivotal to rewrite the rules of treasury departments for Asian MNCs.</p>
<p>Below we highlight four key areas of focus where disruptions are more often experienced by the treasury department of these MNCs, assuming they maintain a moderate to significant operation in the US:</p>
<h5>Cash management and planning.</h5>
<p>The improved cash tax position arising from the reduced corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, accelerated cost recovery of capital expenditures and other cash tax improvement items under the new law will need to be rebalanced with the additional tax costs attributable to the less cash tax-friendly provisions. These provisions include the toll tax on mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign untaxed earnings, expanded limitation of net business interest expense deduction, potential additional tax burden from base erosion payments, GILTI.</p>
<h5>FX/hedging risk management.</h5>
<p>As additional cash needs become apparent for US arms of Asian based MNCs to meet their toll tax obligation (albeit over an eight-year payment period), these US companies may be required to bring back offshore cash which could be in various non-US currencies, likely disrupting standing FX hedging programmes. Treasury departments will need to revisit FX and trades to ensure adequate levels of US currencies are maintained in meeting the additional US cash tax needs.</p>
<p>One common practice for multinationals is separate cash pool structures for US and non-US cash. An influx of cash to the US, combined with lower tax costs associated with the dividend participation exemption, may trigger increasing interest in exploring one global cash pool, or cash pool arrangements with multi currency notional cash pooling features.</p>
<h5>Capital market and cost of funding.</h5>
<p>The expanded limitation on net business interest deduction is expected to increase the cost of capital in the US. Depending upon companies’ access and ability to borrow locally, this may hamper attractiveness to borrow in the US for funding the investment needs of the group’s global operations. However, in countries such as Hong Kong and Singapore, where interest expense incurred for the acquisition of investment that generates non-taxable income is not deductible, the US interest deduction regime becomes more attractive when MNCs borrow in the US for the group’s financing needs in and outside of the US (where the deduction limit is not breached).</p>
<h5>Liberation of repatriation increasing collective liquidity/investments.</h5>
<p>The participation exemption essentially liberalises the means to bring back non-US earnings to the US arm of Asian based MNCs. The MNCs now have freedom to implement repatriation plans without the legacy US tax burden. As part of cash management planning, MNCs will need to consider how to redeploy the cash efficiently including paying down existing high interest debt, increasing capital expenditures spend, fund M&amp;A activities and declaring dividends.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>All treasurers have strong opinions on KYC. Indeed, some go as far as calling the whole process a “nightmare” because of the amount of time and effort they spend on it. What is more, a recent Thomson Reuters survey of this space showed that treasury professionals expect the situation to get worse before it gets better.
</p>
<p>In a recent webinar hosted by the Treasury Today Group, Rana Datta, Head of KYC and Onboarding Sales, Asia Pacific at Thomson Reuters spoke in detail about the findings of Thomson Reuters’ latest study and the challenges that corporates currently face. These issues range from a lack of common standards, the need to deal with multiple people during the process, security concerns and just a general consumption of time and effort.</p>
<p>Ultimately, KYC challenges are forcing corporates to re-evaluate their banking relationships and sometimes disregard banks because of KYC. A poll of the audience during the webinar found that a staggering 58.1% had discounted a bank because the KYC process was too onerous.</p>
<h3 id=""the-other-side-of-the-coin"">The other side of the coin</h3>
<p>Datta explained that corporates are increasingly burdened by their shareholder obligations to conduct KYC on their buyers and suppliers and specific corporations (designated non financial businesses and professionals) will come under the purview of regulators in relation to AML and KYC reporting obligations. Areas that corporates must be cognisant of, from a substantive risk perspective, include meeting anti-bribery and corruption regulations; having a clean supply chain; adhering to ESG obligations and unwrapping the corporate structure to understand who is behind the business to make sure it is not falling foul of sanctions.</p>
<p>Although this is the less-discussed side of KYC, it was encouraging to see from a poll of the audience that a third already had a formal client/supplier due diligence programme in place and a further third were planning to put one in place soon.</p>

<h3 id=""centralise-and-streamline"">Centralise and streamline</h3>
<p>To conclude the webinar, Datta spoke of the merits of a centralised repository such as Thomson Reuters KYC as a Service solution in helping both corporates and banks streamline and centralise their KYC processes.</p>
<p>For corporates the solution comes at no cost and allows them to upload their documents to a centralised repository, which creates a KYC profile using this information and publicly available data, that can be shared with banks. Within the portal, corporates can also easily maintain and update their data, relieving many of the challenges that they currently face.</p>
<p>Datta also spoke of Thomson Reuters’ GoldTier solution which enables corporates to put in place a formal client/customer onboarding programme for customer due diligence and best practice. Most corporates currently don’t fall under financial regulations but still need to identify, unwrap shareholding structure, screen and take a risk-based approach to onboarding. The solution helps corporates ensure transparency, reduces operational costs and improves client servicing.</p>
<h3 id=""time-to-act"">Time to act?</h3>
<p>This thought-provoking webinar not only highlighted the challenges that corporates face around KYC; it also showed that there are solutions and proactive steps that corporates can take to alleviate some of the burdens today.</p>
<p>And it is clear that the regulators are only going to become stricter around KYC, meaning that corporates and banks alike need to act now to reduce the pain and get back to the business of doing business.</p>

<p><em>The EU GDPR will come into force immediately on 25<sup>th</sup> May 2018. Here’s what you need to know.</em></p>
<p> General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is just months away. When it arrives, it will govern in quite strong terms the way organisations collect, use and store personal data concerning EU citizens. It affects organisations regardless of where they are located, and that includes cloud-based operations.</p>
<p>Its purpose is to establish an EU-wide harmonised legal approach to data protection. At its core is the demand for the unambiguous consent of the individual for their data to be held, and the granting of new rights to secure their protection. Most affected organisations will have a lot of work ahead of them in order to comply in time. And comply they must, as the penalties will potentially be severe.</p>
<h3 id=""a-digital-response"">A digital response</h3>
<p>In an age when cloud computing and connected devices have transformed the ways in which people live and work, personal data is commercial gold dust.</p>
<p>Informed consent is easy enough to comprehend with cookies on a website, but how much control do people have over their personal information? Not enough, the authorities say.</p>
<p>In the old days of EU Directive 95/46/EC, the rules had been crafted when digital was barely on the radar. GDPR is a way of giving protection and rights to EU citizens in an age where most organisations – from public to private, from commercial to non-commercial – source and use data in wholly different digital ways.</p>
<p>Once in force, GDPR requires companies to obtain customers’ consent prior to collecting and processing their personal data. They will also have to carry out detailed audits of the data that they already hold to ensure that consumers have actively opted-in.</p>
<p>The new protections and rights enshrined in GDPR demand that every affected organisation should have a plan in place by now. Even UK-based organisations not operating in the EU who may have been uncertain as to how to react with the impending exit from the EU, now have clarity on the matter. This comes in the form of the UK government’s issuance of its statement of intent to adopt a new data protection bill along the lines of GDPR as part of its planned reforms.</p>
<p>The requirements of GDPR are similar to the old EU Data Protection Directive. The type of personal data covered by the old data protection rules – names, addresses, dates of birth and so on – remain on the list. GDPR, in its pursuit of digital protection, not only includes photographic and CCTV images but also online identifiers such as an IP address, certain encrypted data, and even biometric data used for security identification.</p>
<p>The European Commission claims it will make it simpler and cheaper for companies to do business in the EU. It says it could also save an estimated total €2.3bn per year by consolidating supervision into one authority.</p>

<h3 id=""foundations-of-success"">Foundations of success</h3>
<p>Under GDPR, it is essential that information is protected. According to Communisis Data Intelligence, a UK-based independent data and analysis services company, the need is for a wide-ranging, multi-layered approach to security. This should address areas including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>User awareness and education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incident management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information risk management regime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Home and mobile working.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Management of user privileges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removable media controls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitoring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secure configuration of technology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Malware protection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Network security.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id=""people-power"">People power</h3>
<p>In a world where individuals are increasingly data-savvy, tech-firm IBM has said that there is a clear understanding of how brands use personal data for sales and marketing purposes, an awareness of rights with regard to personal data, and a genuine concern about the well-publicised threat of cyber data theft.</p>
<p>New powers handed to individuals will enable them to demand to see any data held by organisations concerning them, for the organisation to immediately make amendments to any errors, and for the individual to have that data removed from almost any system as part of their ‘right to be forgotten’. Additionally, there is an ‘opt in’ clause where organisations seek sensitive data from individuals.</p>
<p>GDPR also introduces 72-hour breach notification requirements. The fine for a slow or poor-quality response to a data breach are materially significant.</p>
<p>Indeed, organisations failing to comply could face a sliding scale of punishments, ranging from a simple warning up to fines of €20m or 4% of global turnover. The right of aggrieved parties to sue for compensation could also see the rise of so-called ‘legal claims farms’, as seen in the aftermath of the UK’s PPI mis-selling scandal.</p>
<p>Findings from Lloyds Insurance show that cyber risk rose from twelfth place to third in the priorities of global business owners between 2013 and 2015. A re-examination of insurance arrangements to ensure that any applicable indemnity limits will cover the costs associated with investigations and breaches under the GDPR may be appropriate.</p>
<h3 id=""a-job-for-business"">A job for business</h3>
<p>The EU has said that GDPR responsibility specifically applies to “the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data”.</p>
<p>This translates into either ‘controllers’ (those who make decisions on how and why personal data is processed) or ‘processors’ (those who carry out the data controller’s requirements).</p>
<p>The individual rights and legal framework that supports GDPR means organisations must have quick access to any relevant personal data they hold. There is also a requirement for all controllers to ensure their processors are compliant, and for processors to keep records of all data processing activities for inspection on-demand by a single data protection authority. In the UK, for example, it will be the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO).</p>
<p>In large and fragmented organisations, this may be difficult. Some businesses have said they will struggle to comply. Speaking at a panel discussion at London’s InfoSecurity Europe 2017 conference, John Lewis Group Data and Information Security Officer, Steve Wright, noted that, as a retailer, the Right to be Forgotten “is going to be incredibly difficult to fulfill within 30 days”. With lengthy warranty periods up to ten years in some cases, the firm will be unable to entirely delete that data when requested.</p>
<p>On the same panel, HSBC’s Deputy General Counsel, Cameron Craig, criticised the ICO’s guidance, noting that although GDPR mirrors existing rules, “unfortunately instead of having a single black line saying ‘these are the changes’, you have to work out what is actually different”.</p>
<p>The fundamental requirement of GDPR compliance is thus to ensure that organisations are absolutely clear as to why they are collecting an individual’s data, have secured the right to do so, and then have the means of securely managing it, accessing and deleting it (either upon request or when it is no longer needed).</p>
<h3 id=""banking-on-compliance"">Banking on compliance</h3>
<p>Research from management consultancy Baringa Partners shows that banks are in a strong position when it comes to data governance. However, banks still risk losing customers should they experience a data breach. The issue is further complicated by the arrival of PSD2 payments regulation. This pushes banks towards a new open-banking model in which third parties are allowed to connect to banking front-ends – and customer data – using APIs.</p>
<p>PSD2 effectively creates a data access point which some banking clients may not wish to be exposed to. In Italy, transposition of PSD2 into national legislation allows banks to block access to third parties should a client request it. Other jurisdictions may follow.</p>
<p>The issue is perhaps a moot point anyway. Banks top the rankings when it comes to who consumers trust with their personal data. More than three quarters (77%) of people said they trust their bank, compared to 62% for insurers, 59% for energy companies and 58% for TV, phone or internet providers.</p>
<p>These high levels of trust seem to be driven by knowing what personal data is currently held on them. This is true for more than half (54%) of bank customers, compared to 42% of insurance and TV, phone or internet customers, and just 40% of energy customers. Banks also score highest for communicating the right amount with their customers about their personal data, at 55%, compared to 46% for insurers, energy companies and TV, phone or internet providers.</p>
<p>“Despite the financial crisis, it is clear that people’s faith in banks has not disappeared entirely,” says Daniel Golding, Director at Baringa. He believes customer loyalty has a big role to play. Trust is highest where people feel there is a long-standing relationship, so the low churn among banking customers compared to energy or internet providers works in their favour. “While banks are the guardians of our hard-earned savings, we are happy for them to be guardians of our personal data, too.”</p>
<p>However, the firm’s research also reveals that banks face significant risks when GDPR comes into force. Almost a third of people (29%) say that they would immediately switch to another bank if their provider suffered a major breach where their personally identifiable data was leaked.</p>
<p>In addition, three quarters (72%) said they are likely to ask what personal data is held on them if their bank is obliged to respond. If companies fail to provide a free electronic copy of their full personal data within a month it will be considered a Tier 1 breach of the rules, leading to the kind of penalties mentioned above.</p>
<p>Firms that lack centralised data governance systems will struggle to respond in an efficient and timely way and will face higher costs.</p>
<h3 id=""the-task-in-hand"">The task in hand</h3>
<p>For many firms, large and small, this will require a complete review of how their data is managed, including its acquisition, storage, access and distribution. In most cases, an approach from a technological, process and policy angle will be necessary. Analysis, design, implementation, operation and maintenance phases such as those suggested by IBM may be necessary to achieve this. The tech-firm explains that the key areas are governance, people and communication, processes, data and security and states that the initial focus of any GDPR programme should be on where a company’s biggest risks are.</p>
<p>It will also be vital for all organisations to educate data-handling staff to know what its requirements are, and to make them fully aware of the possible impacts of infringement. Training will be essential.</p>
<h3 id=""need-a-dpo"">Need a DPO?</h3>
<p>One of the key requirements of GDPR is the establishment of the role of Data Protection Officer (DPO). The problem is that the rules are not clear as to which firms need one and which are exempt. Initially, it was all organisations with more than 250 employees. This has changed. According to law firm Field Fisher’s ‘Privacy Law Blog’, Article 37 of GDPR makes it clear that the obligation to appoint a DPO applies:</p>
<p>To all public authorities processing personal data (except for courts acting in their judicial authority); or</p>
<p>Where the “core activities” of an entity involves “regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale”; or</p>
<p>Where the “core activities” of an entity involves “large scale” processing of “special categories of data” (such as data concerning health, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, as defined in Articles 9 and 10).</p>
<p>“Core activities” and “large scale”, it notes, are yet to be subject to clear guidance, “but on the face of it, these requirements seem to broadly capture companies who deal in Big Data”. Peter Brown, Senior Technology Officer of the UK’s ICO, has been reported as saying: “unless it is obvious organisations don’t need to appoint a DPO, they should keep records of their decision-making process”.</p>
<p>If one is needed, the DPO can be a staff member or third-party contractor. The role is effectively the conduit between the public and the organisation’s employees in relation to the processing of personal information. They are also the point of contact for all data protection queries, reporting directly to top level management. The fundamental requirement is to ensure compliance with the legislation, including the undertaking of all necessary assessments prior to launching new products and services that use customer data, and as such they must be given all the resources necessary to carry out their functions.</p>
<h3 id=""taking-measures"">Taking measures</h3>
<p>In security terms, all companies have weak points. It might be the systems, the processes or the people that risk data breaches. A working practice such as ‘Bring Your Own Device’ in which employees use their own mobile phones, laptops and tablets leaves networks vulnerable unless formal processes for the management of remote connections are in place.</p>
<p>Where the ongoing menace of cybercrime is amplified under GDPR, companies seeking cyber-security baseline standards could consider seeking accreditation under the ISO 27001 certification in Information Security Management. The standard caters for all sizes of organisation, aiming to provide best practice and thus confidence in data procedures.</p>
<p>Large companies are often targets for hackers but smaller firms need not think they are immune and must too seek to protect their data. It might make sense to use third-party professional cloud services to store data as a way of mitigating risk. For smaller firms in particular, this can offer more protection than an on-premises solution. All sensitive data on mobile devices needs to be encrypted and employees should not be using the cloud for unauthorised storage.</p>

<h3 id=""gdpr-in-30-seconds"">GDPR in 30 seconds</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Individuals will be given greater controls over their personal data.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Non-compliance could lead to fines of up to €20m or 4% of global turnover.</p>

<h3 id=""an-opportunity-not-a-threat"">An opportunity not a threat</h3>
<p>GDPR is not going away; seeing it as a nuisance or threat is ultimately counterproductive. A positive view is that where systems, processes and policies align, there will be improved data-handling efficiencies across the business.</p>
<p>According to insurance firm, Marsh, competitive advantage could be gained where organisations develop their cyber-security and information management systems around the requirements of GDPR.</p>
<p>In its report, ‘Data is an asset: it deserves protection; it offers opportunity’, it suggests that those firms which embrace GDPR as a means to improve their data management strategies – as opposed to a costly, compliance-driven exercise – stand to benefit from greater client trust.</p>
<p>“Rather than regarding compliance with the GDPR to be a costly and disruptive undertaking, firms should see it as an opportunity,” says Peter Johnson, UK Cyber Risk Leader, Client Advisory Services at Marsh. Of course, a single set of rules will make it simpler and cheaper for companies to do business across the EU. But, adds Johnson, organisations “can improve how they safeguard personal information, boost their understanding of how data can add value to their business, and forge a new relationship with clients based on enhanced transparency and security that can further build trust”.</p>
<p>GDPR will help maintain or repair the breakdown in trust between clients and organisations in terms of how personal data is used. For Johnson, this means “enabling proactive businesses to take greater advantage of the data-driven economy”.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The complexities associated with BEPS implementation call for deployment of an effective risk management strategy by global organisations. There are many unknowns around BEPS implementation which give way to potential inconsistencies in application of OECD recommendations, despite timelines assigned to actions such as country-by-country reporting. Even if businesses are currently compliant with guidelines, the rapidly changing tax landscape poses risks which treasury departments need to be cognisant of.</p>
<p>Many corporations have historically focused on booking profits in lower tax jurisdictions, which BEPS now makes transparent. In order to tell a reasonable story to explain where profits are booked, treasurers should gain a stronger understanding of customers and supply chain. BEPS may also affect the acquisition or investment plans of an organisation given the changing tax treatment of cash flows. Treasurers may, therefore, need to change their operational structures to better align with the initiative.</p>
<p>Asian organisations often operate in a decentralised way which further heightens the risk given the large amounts of data required to comply with BEPS, being with overseas operations. Relying on consolidated data formats may hide underlying challenges and to mitigate this risk, new tools and technology are required to enable organisations to operate effectively within existing frameworks.</p>
<p>Given this, treasurers must develop a better understanding of funding transactions and the intricacies of the BEPS recommendations pertaining to financing activities, which means working cross-functionally with different teams within the company.</p>
<p>Treasurers must also gain better control of data, as information-gathering and production will need to be done more quickly as requests for homogenous information move towards an on-demand model. This is where tax technology can help align stakeholders and information providers and enable businesses to effectively cope with the regulatory changes. Treasury departments must start partnering with relevant technology providers that can help, with the right tools, to ensure compliance and increase efficiency.</p>
<p>Without proactive management, the increased level of scrutiny on funding transactions posed by BEPS could impact a group’s effective tax rate. At the same time, having ready data visibility could provide significant insight for not just the treasury department, but also the company’s strategic decision-makers. Corporate treasurers should not underestimate the amount of work to be done and should start planning now in order to successfully mitigate financial risks, reduce administrative burdens and take pre-emptive actions as required.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The BEPS Project brings unprecedented change to international and domestic tax landscapes globally. This will have an impact across a number of departments within multinational corporations, particularly the treasury and tax functions. In an Asian context, responses to BEPS vary significantly across the region, so corporate treasurers will need to be prepared and stay on top of all the changes. BEPS will have a significant impact on treasury activities, particularly in terms of the structuring of cross-border intragroup funding arrangements, the mix in capital structure, the types of financial instruments used and the location of treasury entity.</p>
<p>Intragroup lending through intermediate entities in treaty jurisdictions with limited substance is not uncommon for Asian investments. For example, we have seen the use of Mauritius structure to fund Singapore investment. Going forward, with principal purpose test (PPT) in Action 6 being included in tax treaties, treaty benefits may be denied if the intermediate entity does not have substance to actually manage the risk booked in the entity and an appropriate amount of capital.</p>
<p>A fundamental issue in Asia is the plethora of domestic anti-abuse approaches leading to uncertainty and inconsistency in the application of tax treaties. The hope is a PPT will eventually bring consistency to the application of treaties, creating greater certainty. However, as we look to domestic law and practice for guidance on how a PPT may be interpreted by a country, we see significant divergence in interpretation. Corporate treasurers should be conscious of this divergence and map out their current financing footprint.</p>
<p>The interest limitation rules under Action 4 aim at limiting excessive tax deductions on interest and other financial payments, which will inevitably have an impact on internal gearing/capital structure and reduce the tax benefits of existing financing arrangements. Historically, Asian countries commonly used thin capitalisation rules to limit excessive interest deduction on related party debts. With BEPS, we have seen some Asian countries now considering a more general interest limitation rule.</p>
<p>In the past, using hybrid financial instruments may have resulted in a deduction/non-taxation outcome due to inconsistent tax treatment across jurisdictions. Action 2 aims to counteract such tax arbitrage, so corporate treasurers will need to re-examine the tax consequences of using hybrid instruments for financing purposes.</p>
<p>Many Asian jurisdictions, including Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia and China, provide tax incentive regimes for corporate treasury activities. Tax preferential regimes for economic mobile activities such as treasury are currently under review by the OECD to ensure they are not harmful tax practices. The elevation in importance of the substantial activity requirement in assessing whether a preferential regime is potentially harmful is expected to increase the substance requirement that a country requires for the eligibility of the regime. Corporations currently benefitting from these types of regimes, or considering centralising the treasury function in countries offering them, should keep an eye on the outcome of the review.</p>
<p>From a transfer pricing (TP) perspective, the use of zero-interest loans for related party financing may no longer be sustainable in the post-BEPS environment. There will also be increased compliance costs due to the more comprehensive TP documentation requirements under Action 13. This is particularly relevant given the differing approaches to local implementation of Action 13 across Asian countries.</p>
<p>Corporate treasurers in Asia will need to consider a comprehensive plan to respond to and comply with BEPS standards and related local tax law changes.</p>

<h4>What does BEPS seek to achieve?</h4>
<p>The OECD BEPS recommendations are now being implemented by domestic tax authorities; including in Asia. There are 15 BEPS Action items. With respect to treasury and treasury centres, BEPS seeks to eliminate base erosion through what tax authorities consider unwarranted deductions in the case of hybrids and excess deductions associated with the use of excess intercompany debt and intercompany pricing distortions reflected in the improper application of the transfer pricing principles. Additionally, BEPS seeks to ensure that tax authorities have the necessary taxpayer information to identify and address the types of arrangements noted above.</p>
<h4>BEPS and transfer pricing</h4>
<p>An immediate focus of BEPS has been transfer pricing and ensuring an appropriate return to relevant entities in a group. This is at a time when tax authorities in Asia had started to focus on transfer pricing via new regulation, guidelines and disclosure requirements. The overarching expectation is that profits will be reported where the economic activities that generate them are carried out and where value is created. This includes the need for substance in an entity, undertaking commercially rational transactions and demonstrating control in the entity taking on risk.</p>
<h4>What substance does BEPS require?</h4>
<p>A treasury centre will need to have people with adequate qualifications, experience and knowledge who will form part of the decision-making process for the transactions undertaken by the treasury centre. The impact of not having this substance may be a challenge if a tax authority takes the view that the treasury centre, absent of the important people, only warrants a risk-free return.</p>
<h4>Increased tax authority scrutiny</h4>
<p>Reviews of an entity’s transfer pricing will be facilitated by enhanced transfer pricing documentation requirements and, in the case of large multinational enterprises there is an obligation to file a Country by Country (CbC) Report for each jurisdiction in which they do business (including capital, number of employees and profit). The CbC report will be used as a risk assessment tool by tax authorities.</p>
<h4>What are some of the operational aspects of BEPS for treasurers?</h4>
<p>Operationally, the location, administration and ultimately, the value of the treasury function has to be re-examined. The operating model has to shift from head office “executing” transactions via treasury centres to head office “providing guidance” on transactions at treasury centres. The impact of BEPS on treasury operations is that there will be a need for greater visibility on risk and who bears it in respect of working capital management, timing and manner of cash repatriation, payments/receipts on behalf of, FX risk management, and the overall enterprise liquidity model – financing entities, cash pooling, factoring and increasing local funding vs intercompany loans for some. This is where treasury technology will play a big part. In this regard, BEPS is not just a tax matter but an overall finance strategic imperative.</p>
<h4>What next?</h4>
<p>The expected increase in tax audit scrutiny will require a systematic approach to ensure that tax and treasury have a shared understanding of the tax and BEPS impacts on treasury operations and financial objectives.</p>

<p><em>As KYC requirements become increasingly onerous, what initiatives are under way to alleviate the burden – and what role can technology play in enabling treasurers to overcome the challenges?</em></p>
<p>For treasurers around the world, the challenges associated with know your customer (KYC) compliance have escalated rapidly in recent years. With banks required to comply with ever more stringent regulatory requirements – and facing the risk of regulatory enforcements and reputational damage if they are not compliant – the burden faced by treasurers in supplying the necessary information has likewise increased.</p>
<p>“If you talk to anybody who is remotely associated with the financial markets, KYC will come up as one of the big areas of focus,” says Sanjeev Chatrath, Managing Director, Region Head – Asia, Financial &amp; Risk at Thomson Reuters. “KYC is the foundation of any kind of banking relationship, in that banks need to understand their customers and what is happening in their businesses. Having said that, KYC has grabbed more attention in recent years because of some of the enforcement actions that have happened.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Kristof Segers, a manager at Zanders, says that “monster fines” imposed due to anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions control failings have incentivised financial institutions to strengthen their compliance frameworks and related processes.</p>
<p>With corporates increasingly struggling to meet KYC requirements, what specific challenges do they face – and what developments and initiatives could help them to overcome these issues?</p>



<h3 id=""kyc-challenges-in-asia"">KYC challenges in asia</h3>
<p>Research published last year by Thomson Reuters explored the challenges faced by banks when conducting KYC and client due diligence (CDD) in Asia Pacific.</p>
<p>According to the Asia Pacific results of the 2016 Know Your Customer survey, which consulted 334 respondents across the region, the average time taken to onboard a new client is 26 days. The survey found that the costs associated with onboarding new clients had increased by an average of 18% over the last year and are expected to increase by another 14% in the coming 12 months.</p>
<p>Where specific challenges are concerned, 39% of the financial institutions surveyed cited a lack of people as the main challenge in conducting CDD/KYC processes. The research also noted inconsistent requests for information and “excessive client contact to the detriment of the client relationship” among the challenges.</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h3 id=""challenges-for-corporates"">Challenges for corporates</h3>
<p>Dubbed a ‘nightmare’ by more than one treasurer, KYC compliance can be challenging for a number of reasons. For one thing, the process of opening a simple bank account is often far from simple. “While in the past a bank account could be opened in a matter of days or in some cases within the very same day, we now hear stories from multinationals who struggled for months to open a single bank account, especially for those corporates who have operations in developing and/or high-risk countries,” says Segers.</p>
<p>Where specific challenges are concerned, simply getting banks to provide a comprehensive list of the items required can be problematic. “It can be difficult to get a complete list at the inception,” says François Masquelier, Chairman of ATEL, the Association of Corporate Treasurers in Luxembourg. “Sometimes banks follow up with further requests after you deliver. And even if they are satisfied with the information, that doesn’t mean that they won’t come back in two years’ time with additional demands.”</p>
<p>Another issue is the duplication of effort involved in KYC. All too often, treasurers are required to provide the same KYC information again and again – both to different banks and to separate departments within a single institution. As Jack Spitzer, Treasurer of global health and wellness company Isagenix International, remarks: “I can’t count how many times I have told a bank, ‘You already have that’.”</p>
<p>Even once an account is open, corporates may receive recurring requests for KYC information throughout their relationship with a bank. Furthermore, unlike some other regulatory requirements which can be leveraged for the benefit of the company, KYC compliance doesn’t bring any advantages from a treasury point of view. “What makes this annoying is that it has no benefit,” says Masquelier. “You don’t generate any value – it’s a pure compliance issue.”</p>
<h4 id=""lack-of-consistency"">Lack of consistency</h4>
<p>Compounding the challenge, the type of information requested can vary between banks and from country to country. For companies which work with multiple banks around the world, providing the necessary information can be extremely time consuming. Depending on the jurisdiction, companies may need to provide the passports, utility bills and bank statements of all signatories on a particular account. Requirements may also include directors’ information, such as names, addresses and dates of birth, as well as tax and legal documentation.</p>
<p>The lack of consistency between banks is a common challenge. “One issue is that there is no standardisation,” says Bart Claeys, Head of KYC Compliance Services at SWIFT. “The regulations are strict and they are continuing to evolve. At the same time, each bank will have its own internal risk appetite and will define its internal policies.”</p>



<blockquote><p>If you talk to anybody who is remotely associated with the financial markets, KYC will come up as one of the big areas of focus.</p></blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">Sanjeev Chatrath, Managing Director, Region Head – Asia, Financial &amp; Risk, Thomson Reuters</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Where specific challenges are concerned, Claeys notes that there is still a lot of physical document exchange involved in the bank to corporate space. “Sometimes these documents will need to be signed or notarised, bringing additional overhead,” he says. “This varies from institution to institution. Other banks may require a different format, or may require a certified translation of the document. What this means is that every corporate is having to redo the work with every bank and for every request.”</p>
<h4 id=""escalating-requirements"">Escalating requirements</h4>
<p>Marianna Polykrati, Group Treasurer of Chipita, a Greek based international food group of companies, points out that some the majority of banks today require corporates to provide details of their shareholding structures up to the individuals who own from 10% to 25%, depending upon either the country’s Central Bank policy or the bank’s own compliance policy. In some countries, the requirements can be even more arduous. “In Cyprus, there’s now a requirement that each relationship manager has a face-to-face meeting with each beneficial owner,” says Polykrati.</p>
<p>She notes that the requirements have ramped up considerably in the last two years: “Previously, we didn’t have to deal with so many issues – we simply provided a declaration. But now, for example, the National Bank of Serbia requires all the certificates of directors and beneficial owners of all the intermediary companies.”</p>
<h3 id=""impact-on-bank-relationships"">Impact on bank relationships</h3>
<p>These issues can have a significant impact on the relationship between corporate treasurers and their banks – indeed, in some cases KYC-related considerations may limit the pool of banks available to corporate treasurers. Polykrati explains that while providing the required information may not be an issue for public companies, “for a private company belonging to a fund or to wealthy individuals, there can be a reluctance to provide the necessary data such as passport copies and home addresses, primarily due to security issues.”</p>
<p>For Chipita, which has 28 banking relationships across countries including countries India to Mexico, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, Serbia and Cyprus, Polykrati says that this has resulted in some restrictions in terms of the banks the company can work with. “In some cases the attempt to initiate a new co-operation is too bureaucratic, so we decide at the end to work only with banks which already have a relationship with our top level parent company, or a bank that our major shareholder works with,” she explains.</p>
<h4 id=""counting-the-cost"">Counting the cost</h4>
<p>At the same time, the costs involved in KYC compliance can prompt banks to ask whether some relationships make business sense. Claeys notes that as the costs incurred by banks in doing KYC continue to rise they are, in some cases, becoming prohibitive. “If an institution performing KYC sees the cost go up to tens of thousands of euros, they will be asking whether that justifies the business opportunity,” he says. “If it doesn’t, they might decide not to onboard the client.”</p>
<p>ATEL’s Masquelier says that he has direct experience of this. “In one country, one of our banks took the KYC admin burden as a reason to decline opening an account for us,” he explains. “If banks start being selective in this way it will create a difficult situation – particularly for small and medium sized businesses.”</p>
<p>All of this comes at a cost. Chatrath notes that a global survey conducted by Thomson Reuters last year found that the costs and complexity of KYC are rising with financial institutions spending on average US$60m per year on client on-boarding and KYC processes – with that cost continuing to grow around 19% a year. “A lot of financial institutions have invested pretty heavily in terms of technology and hiring,” he adds. “They are recognising the need to leverage technology in order to make the customer experience much better.”</p>
<h4 id=""know-your-bank"">Know your bank</h4>
<p>Another consideration is that KYC isn’t a one-way street. Mark Crowhurst, a Treasury Director at PwC, points out that treasurers should be asking questions about how well banks are able to protect their KYC data once it has been handed over. “Corporates want to know how well their data is being managed – they don’t want it to be exposed on the ten o’clock news if someone gets hold of the files,” he explains.</p>
<p>But there are also opportunities to benefit from banks’ expertise in this area. Crowhurst says that many banks advise their clients about topics such as cyber risk, which can benefit both parties. “There’s a reason why KYC and AML are important,” he adds. “Treasurers should talk to banks about why the requirements are so stringent and ask how they can help them reinforce their controls.”</p>
<h3 id=""leveraging-technology"">Leveraging technology</h3>
<p>Despite the many challenges, there are a number of developments and initiatives which may help to alleviate the KYC burden for corporate treasurers. In some locations, regulators themselves may play a part in helping to overcome the challenges. Chatrath notes, “I’m very encouraged with the amount of co-operation I’ve seen across regulators in Asia. They tend to be very focused around what they can do to be more enabling of the economies they operate in, while fulfilling their responsibility to avoid introducing the unnecessary risk of contagion within their regulated institutions.” He adds that it is not uncommon to see a number of regulators across Asia talking to each other, learning from each other and sharing information so that they can collectively be better informed.</p>
<p>It is clear that technology can play a role in streamlining KYC compliance for corporates. According to Zanders’ Segers, “The easiest and cheapest way is to be equally stringent towards your banks with regards to the information they request and ideally corporates should aim to agree on a standardised approach across their banking partners to prevent replication of tasks. Some companies store the relevant KYC company data in spreadsheets which they keep up to date and share with all of their banking partners on a predefined schedule.”</p>
<p>Innovative technology is also bringing new opportunities for efficiency, and there is considerable interest in how such developments can be leveraged to streamline the processes associated with KYC and compliance as a whole. For example, the Thomson Reuters Org ID KYC Managed Service enables banks and their customers to exchange KYC related information, thereby reducing onboarding time. Other platforms include KYC.com, a joint venture between Markit and Genpact which enables corporates to upload KYC related documentation and give participating banks permission to access their data.</p>
<p>Aside from solutions specifically designed to improve KYC processes, technology companies are also exploring the use of technology to overcome wider compliance challenges. “We are trying to help as much as we can through our technology solutions and trusted content solutions,” comments Chatrath. “For example, we’ve used machine learning and augmented intelligence to be able to identify fake news from trusted news, which helps us to get to things much faster using social media.” He adds that the company is involved with many proof of concepts around new technologies including digital identity and distributed ledgers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Claeys says that other solutions more traditionally adopted by banks, such as sanctions screening and name screening solutions, can also play a role in supporting corporate compliance efforts. “We’re seeing interest from corporate segments in getting more transparency and controls in place in order to avoid any problems later on,” he adds.</p>
<h3 id=""future-developments"">Future developments</h3>
<p>Beyond the solutions currently available, other developments could potentially help to address KYC challenges in the future. For one thing, PSD2 may provide more opportunities to make ongoing KYC processes more efficient. “Under PSD2, with a corporate’s permission, a bank could access the corporate’s bank statement from different banks,” explains PwC’s Crowhurst. “This allows the bank to look for unusual patterns in transactions.” He notes that developments such as blockchain and biometrics may present further opportunities for improvements around management of AML/ KYC data and verification.</p>
<p>Another area of interest is the development of industry utilities. SWIFT’s Claeys explains that until now SWIFT has focused on the inter-bank correspondent banking space, developing solutions to increase efficiency and transparency in KYC compliance. Particularly significant is The KYC Registry, a shared platform which enables correspondent banks to manage and exchange standardised KYC data. The Registry was launched in 2014 and is now used by nearly 4,000 banks around the world.</p>


<blockquote><p>We are currently running a feasibility exercise and are looking at whether it is possible to define a global standard for bank-to-corporate KYC.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">Bart Claeys, Head of KYC Compliance Services, SWIFT</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>“This is a utility approach with one centralised environment, which means that banks only need to upload their KYC information once,” says Claeys. “We check the information for completeness, accuracy and validity, and banks can then give the relevant institutions access to that data.”</p>
<p>While The KYC Registry is designed for inter-bank rather than corporate use, Claeys says that SWIFT is increasingly receiving requests from corporates who are looking for solutions to their own KYC challenges. As such, this is an avenue which SWIFT is exploring. “We are currently running a feasibility exercise and are looking at whether it is possible to define a global standard for bank-to-corporate KYC,” says Claeys. “We are considering whether a cloud based utility is something we could envisage in the bank-to-corporate segment too.”</p>
<p>Claeys adds that SWIFT is working through some questions before deciding whether to pursue this area. In the meantime, however, he notes that there are certain questions which will need to be addressed before a solution could be developed.</p>
<p>“What we have seen is that it is mostly the large corporate institutions with multiple bank accounts which talk about the challenges and inefficiencies they face,” he says. “But from the banks’ point of view, large multinationals do not necessarily present the most challenges – rather it is the smaller corporates with fewer bank accounts which may present more difficulties in providing the expected level of transparency.” As such, if SWIFT does embark on a solution in this area, decisions will need to be made about where any solution should be focused.</p>
<p>That said, there would be clear benefits to a solution which would enable treasurers to maintain one set of KYC information. Masquelier is an advocate of the utility approach: “Clearly it would be easier to maintain one set of data instead of 15 or 20,” he says. “Any solution that would improve the situation and reduce the burden would be welcomed by corporates.”</p>
<p>Masquelier points out that one potential obstacle is that most corporate treasurers prefer to wait until a finished product is available. “They don’t want to pioneer new solutions – but we do need a few pioneers to push this through,” he concludes.</p>

<h4 id=""tell-us-a-bit-about-yourself-and-your-background-how did-you-get-into-fintech-and-what-has-made-you-want-to-solve-the-kyc-challenge"">Tell us a bit about yourself and your background. How did you get into fintech and what has made you want to solve the KYC challenge?</h4>
<p>My background spans law, technology and finance. After graduating from Northeastern University I set up a company that offered outsourced corporate secretarial services to companies setting up their operations. Part of this role included opening bank accounts and I remember being amazed how it took banks 28 days to perform KYC checks that we would be able to complete in one day. It was especially onerous when doing this across borders and it was here that I started thinking about how the KYC space could be improved through the use of technology.</p>
<p>Before founding KYC-Chain I worked across numerous roles and industries including being CFO for a company with over 100 employees. I know enough about finance to be dangerous. I have also established some successful technology start-ups that proved to be very good learning experiences. In more recent years I have become fascinated with distributed ledger technology and the opportunities that this provides to make financial services more secure, transparent and efficient.</p>
<p>In marrying all these experiences together, I established KYC-Chain in 2016. KYC is an interesting and very complex area and because I do not come from a banking background I feel that I can look at some of the processes through a different lens. We can kill some sacred cows. What is most obvious when working with banks is that their focus is on incremental change – and there is a good reason for this, they work in a highly-regulated environment and are risk averse. But with KYC-Chain we believe that we can partner with banks to drive revolutionary change and make the KYC experience exponentially better for banks and their clients.</p>
<h4 id=""what-makes-fintech-such-an-exciting-space-to-work-in"">What makes fintech such an exciting space to work in?</h4>
<p>You just have to look at the pace of change and how the corporate and financial landscape is changing. Take Ant Financial, this is a spin off from Alibaba Group and it is valued more than Goldman Sachs despite being just a few years old. What has facilitated this? Technology. In the right hands technology has the power to facilitate exponential change.</p>
<p>The relationship between technology and finance is speeding up. For a long time, there has been technology component in finance but the environment is changing at a rapid pace where some technology companies that have got into finance are now bigger than the banks. See Ant Financial, Ping An Insurance and disruptor banks in the UK – these are technology companies at their core. People need banking services but they don’t necessarily need them from a bank. Banks should partner with technology firms to stay relevant, especially those that will enable them to serve their customers better. It may come to a point where if it’s easier (or less annoying) to do KYC with one bank, then they have a competitive advantage over other banks.</p>
<h4 id=""do-you-think-that-the-banks-see-fintech-as-friends-or-foe"">Do you think that the banks see fintech as friends or foe?</h4>
<p>The mindset is changing though and banks are increasingly seeing the fintech community, even those companies that position themselves as disruptors, as an industry that they should begin working with.</p>
<h4 id=""what-other-challenges-exist-for-fintechs-today"">What other challenges exist for fintechs today?</h4>
<p>This depends on the market that the company is operating in, a company operating in the payments space will have different challenges to us. Regulation, for example, worries some companies because it could theoretically impede a lot of what the company is trying to do. At KYC-Chain, however, we like regulation, it facilitates our business model.</p>
<p>More broadly speaking, though, there is a fear that regulators will always side with established financial organisations if there is ever conflict between fintech and banks. Regulators have a hard job balancing competing interests, but ultimately, they have long-standing relationships with banks so human nature says they will back these instead of fintech.</p>
<p>The other challenge for fintech is that the landscape will continue to change. Companies will come and go and there will be consolidation in the market. We have seen this happen since the dot com boom and it will happen in fintech as well.</p>

<p class=""source""><em>Source: KYC-Chain</em></p>
<h4 id=""kyc-2.0"">KYC 2.0</h4>
<p>“The world we want to move into is one that is more transparent, more private and more secure,” says Edmund Lowell, Founder and CEO at KYC-Chain. “At present KYC is the polar opposite of this. It still relies on paper, the processes around it haven’t been standardised and the information is not easily shared from one person or institution to another. The fact that there are still scans of passports moving around the world in unsecured email and snailmail is almost embarrassing when you consider the technological progress made in other areas.”</p>
<p>It is this legacy world that Lowell and KYC-Chain are trying to solve. “We want to make the document and data information exchange between the end client and the financial institution easier and more efficient for all parties,” he says.</p>
<h4 id=""solution-in-action"">Solution in action</h4>
<p>The customer of the bank controls this information at all times in a private wallet that is secured by a set of private keys. Through this wallet, the customer is then able to permission its banks to view the information they need when they need it. The data rests within the banks servers, but the user retains control and access.</p>
<p>“Unlike traditional KYC processes, this really puts the control of the document exchange bank in the hands of the customer where it should be,” says Lowell.</p>
<p>In practice, this means that no longer will customers have to deliver physical proof of identity to the bank when opening a bank account. There will also be no wait time between delivering these documents and having access to the account, as the private wallet has an authentication layer that will enable the customer to access the bank account right away.</p>
<p>In an effort to drive further security, KYC-Chain employs agent software that allows two siloed data sets to talk to each other using cryptographic keys. What this allows is for documents to be shared in the traditional manner (the full document) or identity can also be confirmed through a zero-knowledge based proof. “This shares the least amount of information satisfied to meet requirements,” says Lowell. “For instance, if you simply need to show that you are over a certain age, you could choose to share only that bit of information, as opposed to sharing more than is needed. Traditionally you would have to show a government issued ID which would also reveal other items like your address, sex or exact date of birth.”</p>
<h4 id=""solution-delivery"">Solution delivery</h4>
<p>Although there are numerous ways that this solution can be deployed, right now, KYC-Chain is offered as a dockerised SaaS application to the banks who then provide their own branded interface to customers. “It makes sense to offer the solution this way because it is the banks that are asking for this KYC information, not KYC-Chain,” says Lowell.</p>
<p>But what he believes is crucial is that blockchain isn’t a centralised store of information, meaning that the customer’s data is not hosted on KYC-Chain’s servers, or the blockchain itself – unlike some of the other companies who are working in this space. “The data is hosted on the bank’s servers, but it is locked down and only the customer can decide when this information can be accessed,” adds Lowell.</p>
<h4 id=""treasury-interest"">Treasury interest</h4>
<p>Any solution that can go some way to solving the KYC burden is bound to gain the attention of the treasury community. “The benefits to corporates are clear, it can help make their information more secure, private and give them more control.”</p>
<p>The next step for KYC-Chain, says Lowell, is the continued development of the authentication layer within the platform. “There is a natural synergy between what we are doing now and acting as an authentication layer,” he says. “It will happen as a natural evolution and utilise tokens and biometrics.” This will potentially eliminate the need for treasurers to carry around multiple authentication devices to access their banks, something that all in the corporate community will welcome.</p>

Overcoming compliance challenges,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>Compliance has long been an area of concern for corporate treasurers. However, the recent wave of new regulation has made this area more pressing – and challenging – than ever before. “In the last few years, treasurers have realised that, given the speed and complexity of regulations that are coming out of Europe, the US and other jurisdictions, they need to be much more alert to regulation itself,” says Ruth Wandhöfer, Global Head of Regulatory and Market Strategy at Citi.</p>
<p>While compliance is a challenge for treasurers around the world, the nature of those challenges – and the way in which treasurers address them – varies considerably between companies. A recent market study published by FIS asked how treasurers currently approach risk management and regulatory compliance. “In the FIS Treasury Risk Management and Regulations study we recently completed, we learned Basel III was expected by treasurers to have a significant impact on depository relationships, short-term cash management strategies, and financial services pricing,” says Andrew Bateman, Head of Treasury, Payments, Receivables Solutions at FIS.</p>
<p>“With most Dodd-Frank rules either finalised or close to being finalised, treasurers are getting settled into the new normal – we’re seeing greater efforts required to record and report data, especially data related to derivatives. Corporates are still in the process of understanding the implications of moving away from IAS 39, so that attention can be turned to reducing operational complexity and capitalising on possible new hedging opportunities presented in IFRS 9.”</p>
<h3 id=""areas-of-focus"">Areas of focus</h3>
<p>Treasurers are facing compliance challenges in a number of different areas. While the implications of Basel have been written about extensively, other regulatory topics are also significant – including the introduction of IFRS 9. However, the FIS study found that almost half of respondents were unclear about the impact IFRS 9 would have on reporting and accounting for derivatives. The survey noted, “Key IFRS 9 implications for treasurers include changes in hedge accounting effectiveness thresholds, an expansion in items which qualify for hedge accounting, as well as benefits for those organisations engaging in economic hedging activities.”</p>
<p>Where the securities space is concerned, Wandhöfer says that MiFID II could lead to some compliance challenges that are quite specific to large corporates that are very active in the trading business. “Of course these businesses have already been on the case for some time,” she says. “They have made presentations to the EU to help advocate on the technical side, but they will need to focus quite specifically on what these changes mean from a compliance point of view when it comes to topics such as reporting and transparency.”</p>
<p>Wandhöfer adds that a key pain point is the Know Your Customer (KYC) account opening process, which is highly paper based. “The country differences lead to problems when it comes to filling out different types of forms. But there is also the ongoing KYC effort which has to be constantly refreshed.”</p>
<p>Wandhöfer points out that banks are under pressure to have the right data for their clients at all times, so if anything changes – for example, if a board member is replaced – KYC will need to be refreshed. “The question there is how you can create a KYC model whereby the corporate has an automated process for pushing updated data to the bank, rather than the bank phoning the corporation and asking for paper copies of passports.”</p>
<p>Other areas of focus include EMIR and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. However, a question mark exists over the fate of Dodd-Frank following the election of Donald Trump, who has pledged to dismantle the regulation.</p>
<p>While the compliance challenges that companies face are numerous and varied, treasurers should be aware that not all new regulation comes to pass – at least not in its original form. Section 385 of the Internal Revenue Code had been widely expected to have a negative impact on cash management structures such as cash pooling and in-house banking. However, following a consultation period, the final and temporary regulations published on 13<sup>th</sup> October included exemptions for arrangements such as cash pooling.</p>
<p>By the same token, some regulations can have a positive rather than a negative effect on corporations, as illustrated by the introduction of SEPA.</p>
<h3 id=""what-determines-compliance-challenges"">What determines compliance challenges?</h3>
<p>While there are many areas of compliance to consider, not all companies are affected in the same way. As David Stebbings, Director, Head of Treasury Advisory at PwC explains, “Corporates do not only need to understand their own compliance requirements – they also need to understand how different regulations affect their banks and their financial services providers.”</p>
<p>For example, Stebbings points out that corporate treasurers may have some compliance challenges around accounting standards and EMIR – but the more significant concern may be about how banks are affected by developments such as Basel III. “Companies will need to understand how the price of structures such as notional pooling might increase because of regulation on the banks,” he adds.</p>
<p>Compliance challenges will also vary from market to market. “From an Africa perspective, the diverse regulations surrounding centralised or regional liquidity management remain a critical focus area to manage – something which [companies] would also look to their banks to support them in doing,” comments Jason Marsden, Head of Client Solutions – TPS International at Standard Bank. “In addition, international payments regulations, including the availability for foreign currency in some of the markets, remains a challenge.”</p>
<p>Marsden adds that the trapped cash issue can often be further complicated by the way in which a company is set up, and the way in which it invests in certain markets. “Not getting the right approvals may also hinder capital and dividend repatriation,” he notes.</p>
<p>Nevertheless Bateman points out that while compliance challenges vary between different regions and industries, the treasurers addressing these challenges have one thing in common: resource constraints. “Increased demand on treasury operations, and the expanding scope of treasury, has resulted in resource constraints for many treasurers,” he explains. “Finding domain expertise and maintaining a trained team has never been more challenging. Because of these resource constraints, staying up-to-date with frequent post-recession changes in the regulatory environment has been all the more challenging.”</p>
<h3 id=""tackling-compliance"">Tackling compliance</h3>
<p>With so many regulations and variations to consider, where should treasurers start when it comes to overcoming compliance challenges?</p>
<p>First and foremost, it is important to address any issues promptly. “If you’re going to wait and sit on your hands before the new rule is actually there, you’re simply too late,” advises George Dessing, SVP, Treasury and Risk at Wolters Kluwer. “Make sure you’re ahead of the curve – be proactive, speak to your peers, speak to your advisors, speak to your auditors. Try to get more information out of your network.”</p>
<p>Different companies are addressing the challenges in different ways. Bateman observes that some treasurers of large corporates have staffed up in order to help manage regulatory changes. Meanwhile, Marsden says that real time liquidity visibility and management can play a critical role in managing some of the compliance challenges faced by treasurers, “enabling the treasurers to be more agile in their approach to treasury management.” In addition, he says that a number of treasurers are also looking to “localise” their costs as much as possible by leveraging localised supply chains and infrastructures.</p>

<h3 id=""tax-compliance"">Tax compliance</h3>
<p>One area which presents particular challenges is that of tax compliance. “Global treasurers and global businesses now have a lot of focus within their tax department on staying on top of domestic and cross-border developments,” says Ruth Wandhöfer, Global Head of Regulatory and Market Strategy at Citi. “There is now a whole raft of obligations on global corporations to disclose tax matters – namely where profits have been earned, and where money has been moved to. We are starting to see the net closing on the tax matter – even Panama has recently announced that it will participate in the tax transparency initiative.”</p>
<p>Wandhöfer says that treasury has a key role to play in understanding where the company’s tax-related liquidity activities may have to change, what type of reporting is needed and how banks can facilitate the new demands which are emerging.</p>
<p>“On the flipside, banks are spending a lot of time in understanding where global tax rules are going, when something starts to be applicable, and whether changes will need to be made to their products, so that clients can be better supported, for example in the space of liquidity solutions.” Wandhöfer adds, “In a positive sense, this is almost a collaboration space, because every business wants to make sure they are doing the right thing – and so do the banks.”</p>

<p>Regardless of the chosen approach, it is important for treasurers to understand what they are up against. “Treasurers have to have an understanding of the regulatory landscape, as well as the right treasury technology and resources required for process reengineering, where necessary,” says Bateman. “Without any one of these, treasurers are more likely to lose sleep at night.”</p>
<p>He adds that insight into the regulatory landscape is typically a combination of internal and external expertise. “Technology should be best-of-breed treasury technology, specialising in regulatory compliance, which will allow for the department to achieve that compliance in an automated fashion,” he says. “Lastly, treasurers need resources to achieve compliance – the resource problem can be partially alleviated with treasury technology, and a reliance on third-party experts/specialists for implementation.”</p>
<p>These third-party experts might include consulting partners, banks and treasury technology providers. Bateman explains, “Our role at FIS has changed over the years from just a technology provider, to more of a consultative partner. Treasurers are expecting us to not only deliver technology, but also to help navigate the regulatory and compliance environment, both through the technology solutions themselves and through advice and thought leadership.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, TMS providers are working to support treasurers in meeting their compliance requirements. “While compliance challenges continue to evolve, treasury technology enables even small treasury teams to be more strategic,” says Bob Stark, VP Strategy at Kyriba. “This allows them to get beyond basic compliance and contribute to business performance such as reducing cost of goods and services by optimising cash flow hedging programmes.”</p>

<h3 id=""compliance-a-treasurers-eye-view"">Compliance: a treasurer’s eye view</h3>
<p>“A few years ago, compliance was limited to some standard forms – bank account opening and the like, and making sure you knew your relationship manager,” says James Kelly, Group Treasurer of AB Ports. “We then went through a bit of a chaotic phase where new regulations came in and banks set up their own processes, often without sharing with customers the detail of the new requirements, which made it difficult to develop any standard process.</p>
<p>“Banks took on armies of compliance people but typically, corporates have tried to muddle through without increasing staff numbers, which has increased the pressure on transactions which have to be executed quickly, like acquisitions.</p>
<p>“Happily, the rules have now been reasonably established in developed markets like the UK. As a result, not only are customers able to begin to develop a standard response per bank, but the banks are also sharing standards by joining together on initiatives like the Markit KYC platform. Meanwhile, other providers like Thomson Reuters have developed platforms and asked banks to sign up.</p>
<p>“As a direction of travel this is helpful, although the very bank-focused roll out (saving costs but not necessarily enhancing the customer experience) means take-up has been slow from what I have seen.</p>
<p>“The multitude of rules, depending on bank and jurisdiction, has meant that during my time at Rentokil Initial we tried to build a library of what was required for transactions in each jurisdiction. This can then be used to develop systems, rather than adopting ad hoc processes. Interestingly this is an area which the TMSs have not really focused on to date, leaving customers to develop their own platforms.</p>
<p>“With the potential demise of Dodd-Frank, we may be entering a period with a little more stability, allowing systems to catch up with the various compliance demands.”</p>

<h3 id=""the-rise-of-regtech"">The rise of RegTech</h3>
<p>Indeed, the role played by technology in supporting compliance is continuing to evolve. “Technology has a key role to play in supporting compliance,” says Matt Tuck, Head of Global Transaction Banking, Barclays Corporate Banking. “Compliance requires a huge amount of data and individuals can only process that information when it is easily accessible and sorted efficiently.”</p>
<p>Wandhöfer notes that technology innovation is starting to focus on elements of RegTech, where innovation aims to help banks and, increasingly, corporations navigate compliance challenges by allowing for more automation of data feeds and data reporting.</p>
<p>She adds that the manual work involved in data reporting can be almost impossible to achieve, given the raft of different requirements. “Taking tax as an example, you could have multiple jurisdictions asking for slightly different things,” she explains. “Even though OECD principles are harmonised, local implementation tends to be different. Technology is becoming increasingly important as a means of helping automation in that space.”</p>
<p>Wandhöfer says that some solutions which initially focused on helping banks fulfil reporting requirements are now also starting to venture into the corporate reporting space. “Distributed ledger technology could be a real answer to some of this, but at that moment we are still in the experimentation stage,” she says. “We haven’t even got clarity as to whether some of these solutions can be acceptable from a regulatory point of view.”</p>
<p>In addition, Wandhöfer says that smaller, innovative businesses are emerging with various solutions. For example there are fintechs focusing on helping corporates understand the different FX rates that they get from different providers, in order to help optimise for the cheapest choice. She notes that not all such solutions are aimed specifically at compliance – a lot of these focus on improving a company’s business performance – “which I think is quite important, because otherwise you don’t have any money left for compliance.”</p>
<p>One way in which treasurers can overcome the resourcing challenges associated with compliance is by introducing efficiencies and cost savings – often through the strategic use of technology. As Bateman explains, “Without the right treasury technology in place, we find treasury departments spend a disproportionate amount of their time performing the daily ‘blocking and tackling’, something which hampers the treasurers ability to achieve compliance.”</p>
<h3 id=""looking-forward"">Looking forward</h3>
<p>As the regulatory environment continues to change, new compliance challenges emerge. As such, treasurers need to continue monitoring this area, introducing new solutions and strategies as the need arises.</p>
<p>“We’re always anticipating changes and new regulatory requirements for our clients,” says Bateman. “Here in the US, for example, we expect certain changes as a result of the recent election, with the Trump transition team pledging to dismantle, or modify Dodd-Frank.”</p>
<p>Bateman adds that he expects cybercrime to be a greater area of focus and responsibility for treasurers as well, due to the rampant cyber-attacks of the past two years. “We expect treasurers will continue to feel the squeeze on resources as well,” he concludes. “It’s our job as a technology and consultative partner to stay ahead of the regulatory curve, in order to help our clients better navigate the regulatory and compliance landscape.”</p>

<p><em>Regulatory change continues to present considerable challenges for corporate treasurers around the world. From Basel III to KYC obligations, what are the most significant changes currently faced by treasurers – and how is the regulatory environment affecting the treasurer’s role and required skillset?</em></p>
<p>The changing face of regulation around the world has been a major concern for treasurers over the last few years – and this is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. “One could think that the slew of regulatory reform post-crisis is now coming to an end, given the sheer amount of laws that have been adopted and implemented in recent years,” comments Ruth Wandhöfer, Global Head of Regulatory and Market Strategy at Citi. “However, one would be wrong.”</p>
<p>Wandhöfer points out that while key pieces of regulation affecting banks – such as Basel III – have largely been implemented in recent years, other changes are expected for the future. “Elements of Basel III, such as the NSFR (net stable funding ratio) and TLAC (total loss-absorbing capacity), are still to come,” she notes. Meanwhile, other regulations coming into effect may have a more direct impact on corporate treasurers – such as the new money market fund regulations being introduced in the US and Europe.</p>
<h3 id=""basel-iii"">Basel III</h3>
<p>In some cases, regulation can have a significant impact on the products and services that banks can offer, or on their pricing structure. One such regulation is Basel III, which is currently in the process of being implemented. The regulation has significant consequences for banks around the world, as well as on their corporate customers.</p>
<p>“The most significant regulatory change impacting treasurers is Basel III, as this has impacted many long-standing liquidity management techniques, such as notional pooling, and substantially affected the way that bank deposits are compensated,” notes Jennifer Doherty, Global Head of Commercialisation, Liquidity and Investment Products, HSBC. “Under Basel III, certain deposits can be costly and inefficient for banks to hold on their balance sheets, which has reduced appetite for accepting such deposits.”</p>
<p>Doherty says that Basel III is leading some cash-rich treasuries to re-evaluate their investment approach, including the liquidity methods used as well as their broader bank relationship strategy. “Today’s environment means that it is increasingly difficult to generate returns on cash holdings and fully optimise their liquidity,” she explains. “A good example is notional pooling, which has been widely used by treasurers to improve visibility of cash and consolidate it. Basel III has considerably impacted the efficiency of notional pooling.”</p>



<h3 id=""regulations-old-and-new"">Regulations old and new</h3>
<p>Both recent and more established regulations can present challenges for treasurers. KPMG’s 2015 Global Corporate Treasury Survey found that Basel III and EMIR were seen as the regulations with the greatest impact on corporate treasury, both cited by 92% of respondents. Other significant regulations included Dodd-Frank and Sarbanes-Oxley, as well as the more recent Base Erosion and Profit Sharing (BEPS) measures.</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h3 id=""kyc-aml"">KYC/AML</h3>
<p>Another area which is the focus of considerable regulatory attention is that of know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. With regulatory authorities cracking down on terrorist funding and other illicit uses of funds, banks are having to comply with increasingly onerous KYC and AML obligations. This, in turn, is having a significant impact on their corporate customers, who are often required to provide the same types of information to a number of different banks.</p>
<p>“In more than just a few jurisdictions, part of the client due diligence that I have to do on a regular basis includes collecting a passport from someone who is authorised to sign on a demand deposit account,” comments Stephanie Wolf, Head of Global Financial Institutions, public sector banking and Canada sales at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>Wolf points out that these challenges are not just a one-off issue, since requirements are not static and any change to them usually results in having to ask for new or more information from clients. The exact requirements vary from country to country: in some countries banks may need to carry out KYC checks on every single card holder within a commercial card programme. No such checks would be needed for the same programme in the UK or the US.</p>
<p>“I do think financial institutions are well positioned to guard against misuse of our financial system – but unfortunately this can mean a higher burden for clients,” Wolf says. “We certainly try to manage that.”</p>
<p>The impact of these obligations is considerable. Research published by Thomson Reuters in May found that 89% of corporate respondents had not had a good KYC experience. For 13%, this had resulted in a change in their financial institution relationships. When it came to specific challenges, a third of respondents reported that they had received inconsistent requests for information and documents, while 22% said that the delays and paperwork associated with the KYC process had cost them time and resources.</p>
<p>While banks are doing everything they can to make these processes as user friendly as possible, Wolf believes that more collaboration is needed in order to reduce the burden on corporates. “We are looking at how we can work together to standardise our requests and help clients understand what information is needed,” she says. “Conversations are taking place across the industry to discuss how information can be shared within regulatory guidelines and privacy considerations.” She argues that greater levels of information sharing would not only reduce the regulatory burden for companies, but may also enable banks to help tackle financial crime more effectively.</p>
<p>Wolf adds, “banks are working hard to collaborate, which is good news for the treasurers – it just can’t come quickly enough.”</p>

<h3 id=""the-age-of-regulation"">The age of regulation</h3>
<p>While not an exhaustive list, recent and upcoming regulatory changes include the following:</p>
<h5>Basel III</h5>
<p>The introduction of Basel III has had wide ranging implications for the way in which liquidity is viewed by financial institutions – and consequently on the pricing and services offered to corporate customers. Implementation began in 2013 and is due to be completed by 1<sup>st</sup> January 2019.</p>
<h5>BEPS</h5>
<p>The final Base Erosion and Profit Sharing (BEPS) Action Points were published in 2015. The objectives of the rules include preventing companies from moving profits to different jurisdictions for tax purposes. The action points include several areas which may have implications for topics such as transfer pricing, country-by-country reporting, intercompany loans and in-house banking.</p>
<h5>Dodd-Frank</h5>
<p>Passed in 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was intended to address risks in the US financial system.</p>
<h5>EMIR</h5>
<p>The European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) came into effect in August 2012, although the final stages of implementation will not take place until December 2018. The focus of the regulation is over-the-counter derivatives.</p>
<h5>IFRS 9</h5>
<p>The new hedge accounting standard was published in 2014 and becomes mandatory for annual periods beginning on or after 1<sup>st</sup> January 2018.</p>
<h5>Money market fund regulation</h5>
<p>The US has recently introduced a number of changes, including the move from a constant net asset value (CNAV) to a variable net asset value (VNAV) model. Redemption fees and restrictions can also be imposed in certain circumstances. In Europe, proposed new rules are still in the pipeline.</p>
<h5>PSD2</h5>
<p>One of the most significant implications of the second payment services directive (PSD2) is the move towards open banking. This paves the way for the use of application programming interfaces (APIs) to give third party providers access to clients’ bank data in order to provide related services.</p>
<h5>Sarbanes-Oxley</h5>
<p>The Sarbanes-Oxley Act – also known as Sarbox or SOX – was introduced in 2002 to reduce the risk of accounting fraud following a series of accounting scandals.</p>
<h5>SCT Inst</h5>
<p>The proposed SEPA Instant Credit Transfer (SCT Inst) scheme is intended to enable instant euro payments across the SEPA area. The European Payments Council arranged a public consultation on the draft SCT Inst Rulebook earlier this year, with the proposed business and technical rules expected soon.</p>
<h5>Section 385</h5>
<p>In the US, regulations proposed in April by the US Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may result in internal debt instruments being reclassified as equity for tax purposes. This may have implications for companies with cash management structures such as cash pooling and intercompany loans.</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h3 id=""money-market-funds"">Money market funds</h3>
<p>Another area which is undergoing a considerable shift is that of money market funds (MMFs). Historically, most funds have run on a constant net asset value (CNAV) basis, whereby the price of a share is $1 (or £1/€1). Following the collapse of the Reserve Primary Fund in 2008, however, regulators have focused on bolstering the way in which money market funds operate.</p>
<p>In the US, new rules came into effect on 14th October which require prime funds and tax-exempt funds to operate on a variable NAV (VNAV) basis. The new rules also stipulate that funds can charge a 2% redemption fee or prevent redemptions altogether if liquid assets fall between a certain threshold. Over $1trn has already left the relevant funds since the beginning of the year in light of these changes.</p>
<p>“Most clients are just flipping from prime funds into treasury funds and waiting to see what happens,” says Mark Smith, Head of Global Liquidity, Global Transaction Services at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “But those treasurers are flipping into an asset that is lower yielding, so the yield enhancement that treasurers can get from a money market fund versus a deposit is probably at a historic low.”</p>
<p>It’s not all bad news, however. Smith notes that the decline in prime fund investments has meant that prime funds are buying less of assets such as commercial paper, variable deposit notes and certificates of deposit (CDs). As a result, these assets are currently yielding at higher levels – presenting some interesting opportunities for treasurers.</p>
<p>Smith notes, “If you are a treasurer with a flexible, sophisticated investment policy, and if you have got the systems and the team needed to take advantage of this, there are some really good short-term opportunities.” As a result, he says that some companies are re-examining their investment policies to see whether it makes sense to review their policies in order to take advantage of the situation.</p>
<p>The situation is somewhat different in Europe, where negative interest rates mean that companies using prime funds are currently paying the funds to hold their money. Meanwhile, Europe’s money market funds are also tabled for regulatory change, although the money market fund regulation (MMFR) proposed by the European Commission in 2013 has yet to be realised.</p>
<h3 id=""implications-for-treasurers"">Implications for treasurers</h3>
<p>In this climate, treasurers have to be aware of many types of regulation, although different companies are inevitably affected in different ways depending on the nature of their businesses. David Stebbings, Director, Head of Treasury Advisory at PwC, points out that the extent to which a company is affected by regulation depends very much on which sector the company is in. “The closer you are to the financial services sector, the more you are affected by regulation,” he notes. The impact of regulatory change will also vary considerably depending on a company’s geographical footprint.</p>
<p>Some industries may be subject to their own diverse and challenging regulations. “I was working with a company that is opening a new facility in China,” says Stebbings. “They have a special team that goes around whenever the company opens a new operation. This team includes a treasury person who makes sure that the company is complying with all of the regulations relating to collecting cash, getting money out and understanding central bank reporting.”</p>
<h3 id=""understanding-the-challenges"">Understanding the challenges</h3>
<p>What particular challenges should treasurers be aware of? “Many of the regulatory developments will mean enhanced compliance cost and administrative burdens but could also reduce business flexibility as well as approaches to tax, location and overall business organisation,” explains Wandhöfer. “It will continue to be a challenge to keep all these different developments in sight as well as to assess their impacts, both individually and in conjunction.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Doherty notes that the need for safety in the context of their security, liquidity and yield is a key priority for treasurers today. “Treasurers have to manage a greater range of risks, while also demonstrating compliance with their investment mandate, so there is a greater risk management element to the role.”</p>
<h4 id=""bank-related-risks"">Bank-related risks</h4>
<p>Wandhöfer adds that because of the challenging economic and regulatory landscape for banks, “corporates will need to maintain a close watch on their banking partners in order to avoid any surprises that could challenge their operations.”</p>
<p>Such surprises could be significant. In recent months, a number of banks have pulled out of certain markets in a phenomenon known as de-risking. In the world of transaction banking, the decision taken by RBS to step back from offering cash management and trade finance services in most of its European markets has been particularly significant.</p>
<h4 id=""technology-challenges"">Technology challenges</h4>
<p>Doherty points out that technology-related liquidity challenges have increased, and that certain markets and payment platforms are now migrating their infrastructure from batch-based processing to a real-time environment. “This means that treasurers increasingly need to manage cash and liquidity in or near real-time, rather than on an end-of-day basis,” she notes. “While the technology solutions to achieve this may be available, it means that treasury functions need to be much more technologically adept than they have been in the past.”</p>
<h4 id=""a-master-of-all-trades"">A master of all trades</h4>
<p>In this increasingly challenging regulatory environment, treasurers have also had to acquire additional skills and gain a greater level of knowledge on regulatory topics than in the past.</p>
<p>“They are expected to be treasury experts, but they also increasingly have to be regulatory experts,” says Smith. “This means understanding what is going on in the regulatory landscape and how this will affect not only the company itself, but also the company’s banks. They are expected to be tax experts, as illustrated by the arrival of Section 385, which has a huge potential impact on how treasury functions are organised. And they have to be accounting experts.”</p>


<blockquote>Many of the regulatory developments will mean enhanced compliance cost and administrative burdens but could also reduce business flexibility as well as approaches to tax, location and overall business organisation. It will continue to be a challenge to keep all these different developments in sight as well as to assess their impacts, both individually and in conjunction.</blockquote>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>While being an expert in all of these areas is certainly challenging, Smith says that it also brings certain benefits when it comes to raising the profile of the treasurer within the organisation. “With so much critical knowledge being concentrated in the treasury function, treasurers are increasingly becoming seen as key advisors and are getting more board level exposure,” he says. “Treasurers are no longer seen as being just the guys who move the money around and get the bills paid – they are having far more strategic input into the strategy and the financial planning of the company.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the growing demands of the role are making it harder for companies to find the right person for the job. “Good treasurers are hard to come by and are in considerable demand,” says Smith. “I worked with a couple of clients in Ireland who were trying to get treasurers with any experience. They concluded that they would have to get somebody with much less experience and train them up.”</p>
<p>The challenges may be considerable – but for corporate treasurers the importance of keeping up with regulatory change should not be underestimated. “As a company we always follow the rules ourselves,” concludes George Dessing, SVP, Treasury and Risk at information services company Wolters Kluwer. “If the environment asks us to make changes, we follow immediately. At the end of the day, we want to be a good corporate citizen, so this is something that we follow quite closely from a business perspective as well as from a company perspective.”</p>

<p><em>Complying with ‘know your customer’ (KYC) regulation is costing banks a fortune and giving corporations a serious headache. In this article, we explore the role of third-party providers in easing the KYC burden, and the reasons why progress towards the standardisation and automation of KYC they offer, remains slow.</em></p>
<p>It didn’t take long for third party providers to spot opportunities in the KYC regulatory burden faced by banks and their corporate clients. In recent years, financial service providers have sprung into action to support bank compliance with regulation on money laundering, terrorism finance and the hundreds of other demands for more transparency in the wake of the financial crisis. KYC registries provide centrally stored data, easing multiple KYC requests, while more in-depth managed services, tailored to the needs of corporates and their banking partners, are bringing order to the chaos of KYC. For treasurers brave enough to jump on board, the new platforms promise a light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>“A year ago I was drowning under KYC, but one of our banks persuaded me to sign up with a KYC service provider. Now all the other major banks we have relationships with accept the documents that are on the platform. It is no longer a burden,” enthuses Singapore-based Michael Sack, Head of Treasury and Financing at hearing aid manufacturer Sivantos Group. His comments stand out from the resounding moans and groans around KYC.</p>
<h3 id=""alphabet-soup"">Alphabet soup</h3>
<p>The complexity and volume of KYC-related regulation coming down the line for banks and businesses is certainly daunting in its reach. It ranges from the increased scope of the European Union’s Fourth Anti Money Laundering Directive and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, designed to detect US tax evaders concealing their assets, to rules around Ultimate Beneficial Owners, new Common Reporting Standards and the pending European-wide Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, MiFID II. The days when compliance was confined to the back office are over, says Virginie O’Shea, an analyst at Aite Group, the capital markets consultancy. “There is a lot more regulation affecting the KYC universe and banks have so many more aspects to consider when on-boarding a client.”</p>
<h3 id=""passport-paranoia"">Passport paranoia</h3>
<p>To open a bank account a company needs passports of all signatories, names and addresses of all directors, certified articles of association, board authorisations and confirmation of Dodd Frank exemption – and that’s just for starters. KYC rigour varies in different jurisdictions, and also within jurisdictions, leaving global businesses to navigate challenges like supplying proof of residence in countries where there are no street addresses. In another development, executives are growing increasingly anxious about identity theft because of the amount of their own personal data now held with banks. Anecdotal evidence even points to a trend of more senior managers refusing to offer up their personal details for the umpteenth time, passing the authorisation responsibility down to clerical levels instead.</p>
<p>KYC takes resources away from core business at a time of macro uncertainty and slowing growth. Demands on corporate treasurers to provide separate information to their different banks – and different departments within the same bank – takes up precious time. According to a survey by Thomson Reuters, home to KYC managed service Org ID, approximately 30% of corporates questioned said on-boarding took over two months, and 10% said it took over six months.</p>
<p>“The lack of an ability to utilise information already in the financial system from trusted and verified sources is a missed opportunity,” argues Simon Pearse, Head of Compliance at the UK’s peer to peer lender RateSetter which has lent £250m to UK businesses over the last two years. “The impact of this is that customers provide information multiple times, ineffective customer journeys, and lost revenue for firms when customers are dissuaded from continuing with applications due to KYC processes.”</p>
<h3 id=""de-risking-dilemma"">De-risking dilemma</h3>
<p>As banks grow wary of the financial penalty and reputational cost of breaking the rules, so they have pulled out of riskier parts of their business. HSBC was fined $1.9bn in 2012 for violating sanctions and money laundering rules in its Mexican operations. The US regulator stung BNP Paribas with an $8.9bn penalty in 2014 after it broke sanction rules, temporarily banning the French bank from clearing dollars and acting as a correspondent bank for third-party banks.</p>
<p>These banks, and many others besides, worried about working across jurisdictions and successfully negotiating the complex and multiple interpretations of different rules, have slashed their correspondent banking activities. Dollar clearing and remittance handling in countries in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean have shrunk, impacting cross border payments and collections across all currencies. It’s restricting the lifeblood of companies with complex supply chains that depend on making and receiving international payments.</p>
<h3 id=""utilities-to-the-rescue"">Utilities to the rescue</h3>
<p>Financial service provider SWIFT was one of the first to spot the opening. Its KYC Registry, launched in 2014 and now with 2,700 members, provides banks with information on their correspondent and downstream relationships in a shared platform that manages and exchanges standardised KYC data. Specialising in inter-bank KYC, standardisation comes via specific information SWIFT gathers on banks. It ranges from basic identification of the owners behind the institutions and the types of products and services provided, to details of the organisation’s own compliance. “We currently have a defined baseline of data that we require comprising around 150 elements that will evolve as KYC requirements change,” says Bart Claeys, Head of KYC Compliance Services at SWIFT. “Despite the challenge of working with different jurisdictions we are as ambitions as possible in what we ask for,” he says.</p>
<p>Other managed service providers offer more than a repository, tailoring in-depth due diligence for banks, investment managers – and corporates. Thomson Reuters provides KYC services for 18 financial institutions, most recently adding South African banks Rand Merchant Bank, Barclays Africa and Standard Bank to its roster. The details of every one of the trio’s institutional and corporate customers will be placed on a shared database, explains Steve Pulley, Global Managing Director at Thomson Reuters’s Risk Managed Services. “These banks have committed all their customers and are putting real volume through. Their customers are in complete control of their own data and they like not having to deal with so many requests for information.” It’s the kind of standardisation and alignment of interest between banks and businesses that will increasingly emerge as financial institutions and companies seek to take the cost out of KYC, says Pulley. “This is a model we will see in other areas.”</p>
<h3 id=""not-so-fast"">Not so fast</h3>
<p>SWIFT’s KYC Registry has eased the crisis in the inter-bank market and the likes of Org ID, and others, offer a solution to stressed corporate treasury teams. So why is the Holy Grail of standardised, automated KYC, still a way off?</p>
<p>One reason is that banks still have their own on-boarding methods. These can vary from digital-only banks’ use of biometrics like thumb prints and facial recognition, to others requiring the time-consuming collection and collation of hard copy documentation from their corporate clients. A “one stop shop”, argues Aite Group’s O’Shea, is difficult because of each bank’s own particular due diligence. “Every bank has their own checklist, and needs to ask different questions to on-board clients. It is a good idea to have a central place where information is stored and refreshed, but banks will still have to engage with third parties and ensure that clients are contributing the data they need to.” David Fleet, Managing Director, Client On-boarding and Management at Standard Chartered Bank in Singapore concurs. “In reality because there are still differences between policies and standards at various financial institutions, there are still requirements for additional data over and above what the utility collects.”</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>It begs the next question: why do banks cling to their own practices? The answer lies in the fact that ultimate KYC responsibility remains with banks – they are still accountable for knowing their customers and making final decisions regarding customer acceptance. “SWIFT is not a financial institution and we are not regulated as such,” says Claeys. Tom Devlin, Partner at law firm Stephen Platt &amp; Associates and behind the development of KYC360, a community of anti-money laundering and financial crime professionals, adds. “These services are appealing because they reduce the workload and compliance headcount for banks, but the danger is that if the provider gets it wrong, the bank remains on the hook. Banks can’t outsource their responsibility.”</p>
<p>Competition amongst banks is also a factor impeding collaboration. “There is a cultural mentality amongst banks that if they do KYC well, and others do it badly, they will have an edge. How fast a bank can on-board a client affects how quickly they can win business,” says O’Shea. Similarly, the proliferation of competitive KYC services chasing the same segment reduces the chance of industry-wide standards. “Seven is too many. One or two would be plenty,” says David Blair, seasoned treasury expert and Managing Director of Singapore-based Acarate Consulting, in reference to the number of third-party providers competing for market share. He believes that the sector is likely to consolidate and special providers emerge for particular markets, like KYC for SMEs, just as SWIFT has cornered the inter-bank market.</p>
<h3 id=""more-leadership"">More leadership</h3>
<p>It has left some experts to reason that only when regulators deliberately specify clear KYC parameters and requirements, will shared platforms or ‘one-stop-shops’ really work. “Regulators refuse to tell banks what constitutes adequate KYC and banks continue to dream up more and more ridiculous KYC criteria for their clients,” says Blair. “One alternative would be for national governments to take on policing KYC. They already provide passport and tax identification services, and hold details on corporate earnings. This is a good basis for KYC.”</p>
<p>He argues that corporates themselves should also work harder to create uniformity, taking a more proactive stance on submitting their information to shared platforms and updating outdated records that put the compliance process at risk. “This would make it much harder for banks to insist on their own in-house compliance requirements. A strong corporate stand will also make the banks’ position with the regulators stronger,” he says.</p>
<p>Bank acquiescence was certainly something Sack noticed. When Sivantos signed up with managed service provider kyc.com, a platform developed by IHS Markit and Genpact in collaboration with four of the big banks, he was immediately able to take a tougher stance with the company’s 30-odd banking partners over KYC and on-boarding. “By using a tool I know is acceptable to major banks, I can tell my banks to take it or leave it. From our experience they quickly come round to accepting the documents on the platform.”</p>
<p>Similarly, banks also need to encourage their corporate clients to get on platforms, ensuring treasurers understand the proposition and reassuring them that their data is protected. The concept of sharing and pooling information behind the platforms will only work when adoption rates grow, creating in Reuters’ Pulley’s words, “volume”.</p>
<h3 id=""local-laws"">Local laws</h3>
<p>Progress is also stalled by the lack of joined up regulation between regions. Local laws and restrictions, such as whether customer data can be stored outside the country, blight progress. Selvan Lehmann, a project manager at the not-for-profit Basel Institute of Governance explains. “You can’t violate privacy regulations and this also affects reporting obligations. There are still no clear regulations on what banks can, and cannot, disclose to regulatory authorities across jurisdictions.” In an unprecedented attempt to provide AML uniformity across jurisdictions, Basel launched the Basel AML Index in 2012, an annual global ranking of country risk regarding money laundering and terrorism financing. “There was no such tool available before and what we’ve achieved with the AML Index is still only a very small part of the compliance issue,” he says.</p>
<p>Yet these challenges are surmountable, counters Sack. “Our KYC requirements were a nightmare because of the different requirements in Singapore and Hong Kong, but you can find a tool that works for you,” he says. “We benefited from being a small company and having the freedom to make decisions ourselves. As the treasurer, I am responsible for on-boarding and I was happy to give it a go.”</p>
<h3 id=""crime-prevention"">Crime prevention</h3>
<p>For financial crime experts, shared platforms also have other worrying unknowns. Utilities, and even tailored managed services, struggle to provide the event-driven data that tracks the everyday financial habits of financial institutions and businesses. It is this information that builds the complete customer profile that is the real alarm bell to financial crime. “We don’t monitor clients; this is not our role,” admits SWIFT’s Claeys. “If information is updated we send a note to banks, but our role is objective and factual, not judgemental.”</p>
<p>Devlin argues that rather than “on-boarding the customer and then leaving them alone for five years,” KYC needs a more holistic approach that brings banks closer to their customers’ behaviour. It should include tracking client spending habits, social media activity and internet search histories to build an in-depth social profile: it is no longer just about who you are, but about what you do. “There is a limited value in extensively proving who someone is,” he says.</p>
<h3 id=""digital-solutions"">Digital solutions</h3>
<p>Technical innovation offers a solution on the one hand – but adds to the problem on the other. It puts KYC tools from biometrics to running searches for criminal convictions and compiling negative news data feeds at service providers and banks’ disposal. Yet more data means more information to submit and manage, more overheads, and the danger of losing what is truly valuable in the quantity of information. Regulators, and corporates already wary of identity theft, still need to engage with technology. Much KYC regulation was written in the pre-digital age and doesn’t readily facilitate the use of digital techniques, although regulators including the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority and the Monetary Authority of Singapore, are beginning to adapt.</p>
<p>And of course the relentless demand for data holds more worrying consequences altogether. It could push financial crime – and respected, frustrated businesses – away from conventional lenders to alternative financial intermediaries that are not subject to the same regulatory oversight. “Some people will begin to question whether to engage with mainstream financial services because of all the data requirements,” warns Devlin.</p>
<h3 id=""blockchain-breakthrough"">Blockchain breakthrough</h3>
<p>One solution could be Blockchain, the shared database technology shaped around a network of computers which approve a transaction recorded in a chain of computer code. It is increasingly touted as an answer to safely storing validated KYC details on individuals or companies. Details are recorded on a public ledger that anyone on the network can see. The more people that have the ledger and participate in the approval process, the more secure it becomes. Proponents of the technology, like consultancy PwC which is currently assessing the blockchain’s adaptation for KYC, argue it could help with data security around repositories holding large amounts of sensitive data, and greater standardisation.</p>
<p>A recent report by Spanish bank Santander, management consultancy Oliver Wyman and venture capital investor Anthemis, argues that the technology could cut banks’ infrastructure costs for cross-border payments, securities trading and regulatory compliance by $15-$20bn a year from 2022. “Greater innovation around how the information is collected from the clients can improve the overall client experience. Digital solutions are key to this and so are security technologies that improve and ensure data protection. While we are looking at Blockchain and its potential, it is still too early to determine what lasting impact this will have,” says Fleet. Others are more cautious, concerned that the future technology detracts from today’s pressing issues around compliance. “I understand why people are looking at Blockchain but I am still sceptical. I believe it would complicate KYC further, holding it back rather than encouraging it,” says O’Shea.</p>
<p>Whatever the future holds, easing the current regulatory burden of KYC depends on banks and their customers signing up to new platforms. “The end-game that third-party utilities can help drive a single and validated golden source is something that is going to be very valuable for the entire industry,” says Fleet. Far-sighted corporates have got to lead the way.</p>

<p><em>Understanding the diverse regulatory environment is challenging enough for treasurers operating in Asia – but these challenges are being further compounded by the rate of regulatory change. From new accounting rules to more robust know your customer (KYC) obligations, how can treasurers stay abreast of new regulations?</em></p>
<p>From tax rules to anti-money laundering (AML) obligations, regulation is a considerable challenge for corporate treasurers around the world. Complying with existing regulation can be onerous enough, but these regulations are not static: as new rules come into effect, companies must also remain up to date with the relevant changes. For companies operating in several markets, this can be challenging.</p>
<p>Suman Chaki, Head of Cash Management Corporates – Asia Pacific at Deutsche Bank says that the bank carried out a survey of some global clients and asked about their major pain points. “The top one that came up was regulatory diversity and the pace of change,” he says. “So this issue is top of mind for all global treasurers, especially those who operate in multiple markets.”</p>
<p>In Asia, the region’s disparate countries, currencies and regulatory authorities make these challenges even greater. Companies operating across the region may be exposed to hundreds or even thousands of regulatory changes each year, depending on their geographical footprint. Against this backdrop, how can treasurers best keep on top of regulatory change – and even use certain changes to achieve business benefits?</p>
<h3 id=""types-of-regulatory-change"">Types of regulatory change</h3>
<p>There is no doubt that regulation represents a considerable challenge for treasurers in Asia. “APAC is very heterogeneous, and this presents many challenges to treasurers to keep up with the volume and breadth of regulation as well as the diversity of market infrastructures,” comments David Blair, Managing Director of Acarate Consulting in Singapore.</p>
<p>Damian Glendinning, Treasurer of Lenovo, agrees that one of the key challenges is “simply keeping up with the regulatory changes”. He notes, “Thomson Reuters actually has a database which tracks these changes – the number runs into the thousands every year.”</p>
<p>Developments which affect corporate treasuries can relate to anything from accounting and tax developments to cross-border payments and FX flows. Some types of regulation, such as cyber security, ecommerce laws, tax and accounting, may directly affect corporations. In other cases, regulations which are aimed primarily at banks may also have an indirect effect on their corporate customers.</p>


<blockquote>Regulatory changes do not just relate to a single market – there are regulators for whom the changes impact other markets as well, which is the supranational impact of regulatory change. For example, AML embargos are applicable beyond the jurisdiction where they are issued, which affects all clients who have money flowing around the world.</blockquote>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>In addition, areas such as cyber security and KYC are increasingly attracting regulatory attention. “Today, of course, we have the additional burden of all the post-global financial crisis (GFC) regulations, as well as the avalanche of KYC and AML requirements,” says Glendinning. “The practical solution is to wait for the banks to require the input. However, in the case of KYC, there is a serious issue: large treasury departments end up providing multiple copies of the same documents to many different banks – or even different branches of the same bank.”</p>
<h4 id=""more-control-or-less-control"">More control or less control?</h4>
<p>Adding to the complexity, regulatory developments do not necessarily follow the same broad themes across the region: while some regulators are working to increase controls, others are working to reduce them.</p>
<p>“In Asia, there are two streams of regulatory change that keep people busy,” explains Chaki. “One is that regulators are trying to get better control around flows, AML issues and security issues – so they are imposing higher controls. This is true for all regulators around the world. Over and above this, emerging market regulators are also trying to de-regulate their controls. In China alone, for example, there are several hundred new regulations in a year.”</p>
<h4 id=""supranational-impact"">Supranational impact</h4>
<p>The challenges are compounded by the fact that regulations introduced in one market may affect other markets as well. Vivek Batra, Head of Sales for Global Transaction Services at DBS, points out that it is important to understand how changes in one jurisdiction may lead to actions in other jurisdictions. “For example, if there is a regulatory change which affects country A, it could be beneficial to move operations, liquidity or people into or away from country A,” he comments. “The global footprint of the company, as well as operations in individual markets, need to be taken into account.”</p>
<p>“Regulatory changes do not just relate to a single market – there are regulators for whom the changes impact other markets as well, which is the supranational impact of regulatory change,” adds Chaki. “For example, AML embargos are applicable beyond the jurisdiction where they are issued, which affects all clients who have money flowing around the world.”</p>
<h4 id=""industry-specific-changes"">Industry-specific changes</h4>
<p>In addition to the changes already mentioned, companies may also have to take into account regulatory changes which relate to their particular industries – and the industries of their customers and suppliers.</p>
<p>“The treasurer needs to look beyond the organisation – it’s really about looking at the materiality of regulatory change on your whole ecosystem,” says Batra. “An auto manufacturer, for instance, would be affected by borrowing regulations for auto finance companies, and this will affect the company’s operations upstream and downstream.”</p>
<p>He adds, “It is not just about the company. The same auto maker will also be impacted by what’s happening in the aluminium, steel and power generation industries. The treasurer understands the company best and should have a good grasp on how regulations across its ecosystem affect all facets of the organisation.”</p>




<h3 id=""whats-changing"">What’s changing?</h3>
<p>Vijay Shankar, Head of Transaction Banking Asia at ANZ, notes that significant regulatory developments in Asia include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The recent induction of the RMB to reserve currency status.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill in India. This is considered the biggest change in tax structure between federal and state government and all companies will have to prepare.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Partial opening up of Myanmar and related opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changes in emerging markets, such as tax amnesty schemes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incentives by the Hong Kong and Singapore governments to attract companies to set up regional treasury centres in those markets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Negative interest rates in Europe and Japan.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, Shankar notes that net outflows of US dollars are expected out of Asia in light of Brexit and the US elections. Treasurers should be prepared to hedge adequately in order to protect their P&amp;L.</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h3 id=""managing-change"">Managing change</h3>
<p>With such a vast array of regulatory changes to manage, how can treasurers keep on top of all the relevant changes?</p>
<p>The first step is to understand what is changing and how these changes will affect the company. Depending on the company’s geographical footprint, this can be a daunting task. “Even if you know that there are regulations that impact you, as a treasurer it is almost impossible to go through the volumes of regulation and find out what impacts you – especially if you are in many markets in Asia,” says Chaki. “It is critical to have a mechanism by which this filtering can be done, and that’s usually where the banking partner comes in.”</p>
<p>Chaki explains that Deutsche Bank provides clients with a periodic update of regulatory changes that have happened in the previous quarter. This information is filtered where possible. At the same time, discussions about regulatory change are part of the bank’s day-to-day conversations with clients – in almost every client meeting, the first 20 or 30 minutes will be dedicated to regulatory topics.</p>
<p>“For these discussions, it’s important to know our clients’ businesses and their markets,” Chaki explains. “For example, if we know a client is working on a cross-border pooling solution across Asia and another market is opening up and allowing certain currencies to be pooled, we need to decipher that situation and discuss it with the client.”</p>
<p>Conversations about regulatory change are a two-way street, however, and treasurers shouldn’t wait for banks to come to them if they are concerned about particular developments. Wan Chun Shong, Group Treasurer of Tan Chong Group, says that the company stays up to date by continuously monitoring changes, as well as by liaising closely with relevant people who are well connected to the authority. “In this way, we will always have the upper hand before any regulatory rules are implemented,” he adds.</p>
<h3 id=""anticipating-change"">Anticipating change</h3>
<p>Navigating regulatory change becomes easier if the changes are anticipated and the organisation is prepared.</p>
<p>“Some of these changes are expected: you see them coming either because they are being talked about, or because they are obvious,” says Batra. Consequently, Batra says it is important for companies to understand the overall direction or path taken by the regulators. “What changes have already taken place? What is their direction of thinking? It is possible to gain an understanding of the direction of regulatory change, which can help companies prepare for what might come in the future.”</p>
<p>In order to do this effectively, Batra says it is important to engage advisors, such as banks, who are constantly looking at the impact of regulatory change across a wider portfolio of companies, industries and geographies. “If a company is operating in the auto industry, its banker would likely have insight of the auto industry from a global perspective,” he says. “So if there is a Chinese auto maker exporting into Africa, and we have a knowledge of what is happening in those markets and in that industry, we can provide insight to the treasurer about the possible impact on the company’s operations even if it is not operating in those markets.”</p>
<p>Batra suggests that treasurers work closely with their bankers and leverage their expertise and insights. “The objectives complement each other – bankers and treasurers can navigate regulatory change together and act in a manner that is absolutely compliant, reduces risk and enhances returns.”</p>
<h3 id=""conflicting-advice"">Conflicting advice</h3>
<p>Banks can certainly provide valuable advice on regulatory topics – but companies should also be aware that certain regulations may be open to interpretation. As such, different banks may have different opinions on the same issue.</p>
<p>“In practice, most corporates wait to be advised – usually by their banks – of the most significant changes,” says Glendinning. “This approach is convenient, as the banks are usually the ones on whom the onus of compliance falls – for example, when opening a bank account or complying with a new exchange control regulation.</p>
<p>“However, this approach is not fool proof: sometimes the banks themselves have conflicting interpretations of the regulations, and it can happen that these interpretations are not in line with what the authorities intend. Usually, when this happens, it is not hard to establish the good faith of the corporate, and so the consequences are usually not too serious – but the clear message is that ignorance will not be accepted as an excuse next time around.</p>
<p>“This can be a real problem in Asia, where regulations are often vague, and frequently not enforced – until circumstances change, and they are applied again with more rigour. So it is always good to make sure your company has a track record of compliance and good behaviour!”</p>
<p>In some cases, this issue can be overcome by seeking input from regulators on specific questions. For example, banks may arrange joint meetings with the regulator and a specific client in order to gain clarity on a real life situation.</p>
<p>Companies may also choose to call upon different sources of support. Blair notes that while corporates tend to rely on bankers as a first line of regulatory information, they typically look to the big four and law firm advisors for due diligence when they decide to take action.</p>
<h3 id=""seizing-the-opportunities"">Seizing the opportunities</h3>
<p>Indeed, knowing which regulatory changes will affect the company is just the start. Treasurers also need to know what changes they need to make in order to overcome the challenges – and, ideally, take advantage of any opportunities which may arise.</p>
<p>In some markets, such as China, pilot programmes can provide opportunities to gain early adopter benefits from specific regulatory changes. “Banks have to work closely with their clients, ask them if they want to be part of a pilot and take these pilot cases to the regulator,” says Chaki. “It’s critical for banks to be proactive and ensure we are representing the right kind of clients in the pilot programme.”</p>
<p>Companies can also use certain types of regulatory change to drive business benefits. One example is the introduction of real-time, 24/7 clearing systems, such as the FAST electronic funds transfer system introduced in Singapore in 2014. The system can be used to transfer up to SGD 50,000 between 20 participating banks. The beneficiary receives funds within five minutes.</p>


<blockquote>A lot of banking services are moving onto platforms which allow treasurers to access information and analysis faster and cheaper than it has been in the past. Whether it is for anticipating, reacting to or leveraging change, companies should aim to use technology to the fullest extent possible.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">Vivek Batra, Head of Sales for Global Transaction Services, DBS</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>By using such developments effectively, companies may be able to achieve significant benefits. “If a regulator revamps the clearing mechanism in a particular country and leapfrogs from a manual, inefficient mechanism to a real time 24/7 online clearing system, just imagine what it can do for a company’s business model,” says Chaki. “If you can sell to a customer and collect money immediately, imagine how you can de-clog your entire value chain.”</p>
<p>In other cases, staying on top of industry-specific changes can make companies more competitive. Tan Chong Group is a Malaysian company which distributes, assembles and sells vehicles in a number of markets across Asia. In particular, the company is an exclusive distributor for certain Nissan vehicles in some of these markets.</p>
<p>Wan says that Tan Chong Group has used regulatory change to the company’s advantage – as illustrated by recent changes to Vietnam’s Special Consumption Tax. “Close co-operation and support by management allowed us to respond quickly to the regulatory changes,” he explains. “Nissan CBU (Completely Built Up) vehicles with lower engine capacity, but higher power output, allow us to enjoy lower SCT rates.”</p>
<p>The company has also remained ahead of the curve when it comes to the introduction of new vehicle emissions rules on January 1<sup>st</sup> 2017. Wan notes that around half of the automotive players in CBU (whereby a vehicle is imported fully assembled) and CKD (completely knocked down, whereby a vehicle is imported in parts and assembled locally) are not yet ready for the new rules. However, in the case of Nissan both types of vehicles are already prepared for the changes, resulting in a competitive advantage.</p>
<h4 id=""leveraging-technology"">Leveraging technology</h4>
<p>Treasurers can also make use of technology in order to adapt to – and benefit from – regulatory change. “A lot of banking services are moving onto platforms which allow treasurers to access information and analysis faster and cheaper than it has been in the past,” says Batra. “Whether it is for anticipating, reacting to or leveraging change, companies should aim to use technology to the fullest extent possible.”</p>
<p>This might include making better use of the company’s ERP system. For example, some regulators are tracking the purpose of certain cross-border payments in order to curtail illegal flows by requiring companies to use purpose codes. “This looks daunting, but if you have a proper ERP system in place, it’s a one-time activity and doesn’t become such a hassle,” comments Chaki.</p>
<h3 id=""conclusion"">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Staying on top of new and existing regulations is a challenge for treasurers around the world, but this is particularly the case in Asia. Treasurers can make the task more manageable by taking advantage of the information provided by banks, but there is still a need to monitor changes in the market and proactively seek opinions from the experts.</p>
<p>“In the end, no matter how difficult it is, compliance is not optional,” concludes Glendinning. “So it is important to read as much as possible, and use existing resources, such as the banks, treasury associations, conferences and webinars.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>Tax is tax, and treasury is treasury, and never the twain shall meet. With apologies to Rudyard Kipling, this phrase might well apply to the corporate view of two different functions that in the past may not have spent much time in each other’s company. This is not how it should be.</em></p>
<p>The taxation of international corporates is big news in the popular press at the moment. Companies seeking to legitimately minimise their tax outlay use a number of methods made available to them by individual jurisdictions in isolation and in combination. The action taken in this respect does not always sit well with public – and indeed political – perception of what is right (as opposed to legal) but it is nonetheless the duty of the corporate body to be as tax-efficient as it can be, and, as such, the subject of taxation should now be a shared concern for most business functions.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that treasurers are – or should be – a key part of the equation when it comes to providing the most accurate and timely information to the tax department to facilitate the most efficient tax response. Finance function costs have decreased by around 40% over the last decade, according to PwC benchmarking research carried out earlier this year for its ‘Tax function of the future’ series. Although many manage to operate on slender cost-levels, the research results show that the pressure nonetheless continues for all concerned – including treasury – “to do more with less”. The concern that PwC raises in this respect is that whilst finance functions are transforming to keep ahead of the curve, most initiatives continue to take place without the involvement of the tax function. This, it argues, misses an opportunity.</p>
<h3 id=""a-meaningful-relationship"">A meaningful relationship</h3>
<p>Streamlining and incorporating the tax function into financial transformations has many long-lasting benefits, it seems. PwC cites increased regulation, notably generated by the OECD’s 15-point BEPS action plan (of which more later), and additional international tax reporting procedures as requiring “an increasingly symbiotic relationship between the tax and finance function”.</p>
<p>Treasury should take precedence when deciding the most appropriate action for the company, argues David Golden, the Head of EY’s International Tax Services Global Treasury practice. “Tax considerations, in my view, come in after treasury decides that there is a particular exposure that needs to be hedged or there is a new operation that requires financing,” he says. “But then in order to execute that business transaction most effectively, treasury should bring the anticipated business transaction to the tax department or the external tax advisor at the earliest opportunity so that they in turn can present treasury with the appropriate options.”</p>
<p>This is today’s ideal. A decade or so ago, Golden says treasury and tax simply didn’t “play nicely” with each other. “The dynamic was that when the treasury function needs to do something, it usually needs or wants to do it rapidly. Tax on the other hand is usually much more deliberate.” Whilst the fundamental difference in approach to planning had caused something of a “disconnect” between the two functions, which to an extent still exists, Golden happily reports that today this is more the exception than the rule. The relationship between the two roles “is getting better”.</p>
<p>Catalysts for change include recognition by the CFO, and even the board, that both treasury and tax have a much higher profile today. This is largely due to the increasing complexity of the markets and regulatory regimes. The reasons for the observable union of these functions are readily apparent, says Golden. Current FX volatility, for example, has resulted in financial statement consequences that have gained the attention of the boardroom, the concern cascading down the line to CFOs and henceforth to treasury and tax, amongst others.</p>
<p>The argument for co-operation is strong. Treasury transactions potentially have a significant impact on a group’s overall tax liabilities, particularly in jurisdictions where debt financing is raised or there is inter-group financing flow. In addition, different jurisdictions often have very different tax rules. For example, interest payments may be subject to a withholding tax. In addition, FX can be treated on a realised or unrealised basis.</p>
<p>For Lara Okukenu, Financing and Treasury Tax Director at Deloitte, the aim is not so much about minimising tax costs as it is to ensure as far as possible that treasury transactions are not causing any inefficiencies. “It has been well publicised that one of the ways some multinational groups have historically been able to manage their effective tax rate is through inter-group cross border financing,” she notes. “But BEPS and other changes in the global tax environment are setting new boundaries to focus on commercial lending.” She believes that the focus has now evolved into an overarching risk management approach, including navigating the “complex global web of tax legislation” that treasury transactions are now exposed to.</p>
<p>Teamwork thus really is the order of the day in this respect and Dino Nicolaides, Director in Corporate Treasury Services at Deloitte, notes a trend to bring tax and treasury into the same office (along with other functions such as pensions and insurance) to allow greater co-ordination and co-operation. Commonly in the US and increasingly in Europe, the Tax Director and the Treasurer are one and the same. By bringing both under the remit of a single role, the most effective level of communication and oversight is enabled at group level.</p>
<h3 id=""getting-connected"">Getting connected</h3>
<p>Where the functions remain discrete, an ad hoc association is unlikely to yield a sufficiently strong transfer of information in either direction; a closer formal tie will be more beneficial. In this instance, technology can be a performance aid, especially around the timely sharing of data. “Again, with increasing complexity in both functions, real-time information is becoming more important,” notes Golden.</p>
<p>Where treasury-related data naturally tends to be in a TMS or ERP it will typically be uniform across an organisation, giving one type of information for all operations, regardless of location. “This is an issue because jurisdictional boundaries, while not usually so important for treasury activities are in fact critical for the tax function,” explains Golden. Having the ability to capture data more granularly is very important for tax purposes.</p>
<p>In many cases, the tax department needs bespoke functionality to capture and manipulate data but most enterprise-wide systems – such as an ERP or TMS – require manual intervention in order to achieve this. As new systems are being purchased and as add-ons are being deployed, he states that the tax department “would appreciate that treasury consults with it to see, without too much additional cost and effort, whether or not tax-specific information can be made more readily available”. With the business case for new technology often difficult to build but the desire for shared information clearly apparent (and the will for increased efficiencies more so), the sharing of internal budget allocations to acquire the right system may even be on the cards, suggests Golden.</p>
<h3 id=""learning-to-survive"">Learning to survive</h3>
<p>Areas of tax legislation that impact treasurers are many and include withholding tax, stamp duty, thin capitalisation and other limitations on interest expense deductibility, transfer pricing, and rules on Permanent Establishment and Controlled Foreign Companies, as well as the impact of double taxation treaties on local law rules. Each will have its own characterisation and thus will require its own data set. If the tax department has some advance notice of treasury’s intention to, for example, hedge FX, it can advise on the most efficient techniques or instruments to use and what kind of designations or identifications to make. But Golden believes that it is incumbent upon the treasurer to at least have a general knowledge of these matters. If treasury does consult with the tax function “early and often” – which in today’s complex dynamic environment he argues really ought to be the case – then a general grasp of principles can kick-start more detailed discussions with the tax function on regimes where advantageous or disadvantageous treatments are applied. This can prove to be a valuable conversation, especially where treasury is contemplating doing something new and different that could raise a tax issue.</p>
<p>The raised level of dialogue between functions may be complemented by deeper discussions at an advisory level with banking partners. A conversation should also take place with incumbent systems providers (and certainly with any prospective vendors) to ensure each has the capability to deliver timely and accurate reporting of relevant data, and to explore whether core systems need to be updated or replaced to deliver that required flexibility. For treasurers, being able to support the tax function (and other departments) in this way may add to the business case for a move to straight through processing (STP).</p>
<h3 id=""current-concerns"">Current concerns</h3>
<p>It is worth at this point considering in more detail a few areas that are currently attracting particular attention in terms of determining the right approach to taxation. A cash pooling and sweeping structure, for example, can be a means of optimising cross-border cash management, helping to fund cash-negative operations through the cash-positive, to manage cyclical cash flows or assist in jurisdictions where high finance costs exist. Generally, cash pooling structures will result in third-party or intercompany lending, dependent on whether it is a notional or physical structure.</p>
<p>The tax consideration here focuses on inter-company lending and will, for example, look at whether the interest applied is going to be deductible or whether there will be withholding tax on payments of interest, explains Okukenu. “Given that cash pooling is becoming more prevalent in global treasury management, we have also seen that there has been an increase in scrutiny from tax authorities.” This attention, she adds, is particularly acute as the emphasis shifts to transfer pricing (where two companies within the same group transact) and how pool participants are remunerated or charged. It is a common misconception that transfer pricing only applies to physical cash pools; it applies to notional cash pools too, she warns. “There have been recent case law developments for both physical and notional cash pools which have rejected bank deposit rate comparables, resulting in adverse interest rate adjustments for tax purposes to reflect an arms-length rate.”</p>
<p>Another area where regular and continuous tax and treasury dialogue is important is around FX. Whilst the group may be hedged from an FX perspective at a consolidated accounts level, this does not necessarily mean it is always hedged from a tax perspective. The problem, Okukenu explains, is that in many countries, such as in the UK, companies are taxed on an entity-by-entity basis. Unless there are certain hedge accounting options or tax rules that apply, this can lead to cash tax volatility. “It is worthwhile for the treasurer and the tax department to discuss, for example, group hedging policy,” she says. “This should include consideration of inter-group transactions which might otherwise be ignored at a group level but which are still relevant from a tax perspective.”</p>
<h3 id=""beps-is-after-your-job"">BEPS is after your job</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting new tax development in current contemplation is the OECD’s BEPS initiative. As countries implement some or all of the 15 recommendations into their domestic legislation, there will inevitably be shifts in tax policy, in addition to the transfer of resources and operations, noted Robert Sledz of Thomson Reuters’ Tax &amp; Accounting business in a recent BEPS impact report issued by the firm. More as a general warning, MNCs, he stated, “risk reputational damage and tax adjustments that can affect their future earnings if they do not heed this changing tax landscape”.</p>
<p>Certainly the guidance provided on taxation for MNCs has potential to affect a broad range of activities, with many of the points covered by BEPS having some impact on corporate treasury. “A number of the action items potentially limit the deductibility of group interest expense; obviously this directly impacts treasury because it may, on an after-tax basis, increase the cost of funding certain activities with debt,” notes Golden. A broader area of impact for treasury will be the increased reporting requirement, he notes.</p>
<p>As part of the ‘Guidance on Transfer Pricing Documentation and Country-by-Country Reporting’, a new standardised disclosure form, which has already been implemented by a number of jurisdictions, will require companies to file, along with their annual tax returns, additional quantitative and qualitative tax-related information for each jurisdiction in which they do business. This obliges them to identify the legal entities and ‘Permanent Establishments’ within the group (in most countries, income tax is only levied on foreign entities once a permanent establishment exists), where they are incorporated, tax residencies, principle business activities, even the number and location of key personnel (which would of course include treasury and finance).</p>
<p>Further BEPS actions will change the way transfer pricing is viewed from a treasury perspective. As groups move to embed tax risk management policy into treasury policy, increased scrutiny internally of the tax implications of how and where the treasury function is managed is inevitable, says Nicolaides. This should certainly be the case if treasury is looking to set up treasury functions or a shared services centre in another geography. Indeed, in organisations where treasury is intended to be a profit centre, paying attention to the tax implications is vital, he says.</p>


<blockquote>Given that cash pooling is becoming more prevalent in global treasury management, we have also seen that there has been an increase in scrutiny from tax authorities.</blockquote>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Historically, this set-up has been viewed as a capital provider from a transfer pricing perspective. This means that as long as the capital provider is adequately capitalised, and returns on that capital are based on ‘arms-length’ rates (based on what would typically be attainable in a normal relationship between a company and its bank), it would be respected under existing taxation rulings.</p>
<p>Under BEPS recommendations, Golden notes that the fundamental concept of arms-length pricing of intra-group services is seeing the focus shift away from the return on capital, and heading instead towards a return on the function of personnel; the focus here being on the pricing of the real intellect being provided to other group members, and ensuring that profits align to the economic reality of that value creation.</p>
<p>For Golden, this section in part translates as an enquiry as to the physical location of, for example, the cash manager or treasurer. “In the medium term, if and when local countries begin implementing the various BEPS action items, it may require the treasurer to shift the location of personnel,” he warns. As a worst-case scenario, a cash manager or perhaps even a treasurer working from the head office may need to relocate to wherever the in-house cash centre entity is situated. Relocating to a low-cost labour location may not be popular and it may therefore see the low-cost cash centre shifting back to the headquarters, with all the cost implications that this has.</p>
<p>“How far the principles discussed in BEPS Action 8-10, for example around cash boxes, can be applied to intra-group financing more widely is an evolving question. In particular, given the OECD Action 4 guidance on the transfer pricing of financing transactions is not now expected till 2017,” comments Okukenu. “We are already seeing instances where groups are reviewing their group structure and looking to where value is being created to make sure that it is in line with transfer pricing rules on where profit is being allocated.”</p>

<p><em>The current state of play in the regulation of OTC derivatives here in Asia Pacific is still one of slow but steady change. What are the implications of developments over the last year or so for corporate treasurers? Treasury Today Asia takes a look across the regulatory landscape.</em></p>
<p>When it comes to the market for OTC derivatives, comparing the volumes and complexity of Europe, North America and Asia is perhaps unfair given the relative immaturity of the latter (it accounts only for around 8% of the current global turnover). But the market in Asia is making serious noises around expansion with new solutions being offered by a financial and vendor community hungry for growth. The corollary of expansion is, as might be expected, a moving legislative landscape.</p>
<p>With derivatives now assuming increased importance to treasurers here in the region as a means of risk mitigation, consideration of the changes required in the jurisdictions within which the company operates will be necessary. The key Asian derivatives markets are changing and these changes will impact corporates, not least because the regulators are on the case.</p>
<h3 id=""state-of-play"">State of play</h3>
<p>Derivatives play an important role in the economy but are associated with certain risks. Recent financial crises have highlighted that these risks are not sufficiently mitigated in the over-the-counter (OTC) part of the market, especially with regards to credit default swaps (CDS). Since the beginning of the financial crisis, regulators have been working to address these risks.</p>
<p>The well-developed European markets have already faced the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) for OTC derivatives which tackles clearing, reporting and risk mitigation, and makes quite a significant demand on the gathering and collation of the right information for market participants. Progress in Asia is slow but sure.</p>
<p>In July 2014, four of the major jurisdictions in the region – Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan – began introducing regulations in line with the reform principles for OTC derivatives as set out by the G20 committee in 2009. The general objectives of these regulations are broadly the same as under Dodd-Frank (in the US markets) and EMIR. However, in Asia, it seems that each country is moving at its own pace and with its own priorities.</p>
<p>The region’s regulators have each decided to take a more phased approach with different deadlines for different types of market participants. A majority of countries seem to be leaning towards an EMIR-like reporting model in which both sides report, and most have begun with the creation of trade repositories (TRs) and reporting requirements before tackling centralised clearing. But, as we will see, that is more or less where the similarities end.</p>
<h3 id=""the-long-arm-of-the-regulator"">The long arm of the regulator</h3>
<p>Asia Pacific’s corporates will almost inevitably keep taking a steer from the G20’s 2009 market reform commitments to improve transparency, mitigate systemic risk, and protect against market abuse. Is this a good thing? By 2015 the globally operating Financial Stability Board (FSB) noted that the G20 authorities were still facing a range of implementation issues, though international work-streams had been set up aiming to address most of these issues.</p>
<p>Of note, these were looking at steps to harmonise transaction reporting and to agree to a framework for uniform trade and product identifiers; further coordinated consideration of Central Counterparty Clearing (CCP) resilience, recovery and resolution, and central clearing interdependencies; and ongoing multilateral and bilateral discussions to address cross-border regulatory issues (with several additional steps recently taken by authorities in this regard).</p>
<p>For Asian players there is yet more external regulation to consider. Wherever Dodd-Frank and EMIR apply in any jurisdiction in which US and EU institutions operate, both require derivatives contracts to be cleared through CCPs approved by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission or the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) respectively. What’s more, even Asian market participants will find Dodd-Frank and EMIR rules difficult to escape from if they are dealing with US or EU counterparties, since they will also be required to comply with the respective regulations regardless of where their transactions are made.</p>
<h3 id=""keeping-up-with-the-differences"">Keeping up with the differences</h3>
<p>Does the fact that the region is inevitably looking to learn from other regulators (as the voice of experience) mean that, somewhere down the line, we will see the same level of regulatory consistency as in Europe or the US? It seems improbable, given that it would require each jurisdiction in the region to surrender some sovereignty over their domestic markets to a pan-Asian regulatory organisation. With regulation bringing with it such great opportunities for arbitrage, it is a notion that is difficult to apprehend at this stage.</p>
<p>Of course, there may be a degree of harmonisation, but for some countries in Asia it is simply not in their interest. The whole point of China (in particular) launching six different exchanges is that it wants to become the centre for financial transactions. Taking a deliberately different approach may be about attracting business to the Shanghai markets and not regional market development.</p>
<p>The perceived lack of regional harmony could undermine the G20 push for transparency within these markets which was, after all, the fundamental goal of the reforms in the first place. With myriad regulations cropping up across the region – self-interested or otherwise – without one body having oversight of the ‘big picture’ this certainly has the potential to undermine the G20 goal.</p>
<p>In practice, market fragmentation could also pose a challenge for corporate treasurers and other end users too. There will be some jurisdictions in Asia where both corporates and banks will be required to report, but also some where only the bank has to, and some where all asset classes are subject to reporting requirements. Interpreting these rules will require time and diligence. For corporates, the need is to ensure they have read, interpreted and understood the laws and regulations correctly across every country in which they intend to operate. This effort hardly plays well to the desire for market accessibility.</p>
<h3 id=""listen-and-learn"">Listen and learn</h3>
<p>Despite these macro-issues, the journey to match G20 objectives has been smoother, relative to the disruption seen in the US and EU where the introduction of Dodd-Frank and EMIR proved quite demanding. The better ride for Asian players might be accounted for, on the one hand, by the fact that derivative markets in the region are comparatively small. But some credit must also be given to the phased approach taken by the region’s national regulatory authorities who, having carefully scrutinised how the G20 commitments were carried out elsewhere, opted not to take the ‘big bang’ approach.</p>
<p>Since implementation began several years ago, Asian regulators have moved step-by-step bringing trade reporting across different markets segments and asset classes. Last year, trade reporting was live for interest rates and credit only in Singapore. Five asset classes were live in Australia, meanwhile, but only for large institutions. Since then, the asset classes and market participants subject to trade reporting have slowly expanded. Singapore went live, for example, with FX products in May of this year. In Australia, the regulators changed their OTC derivatives requirements to include a much larger community of reporters.</p>
<p>So while banks, corporates and institutions faced a steep challenge in becoming compliant across all of their OTC derivatives activities in Europe, market participants in Asia have been somewhat less encumbered by the changes taking place, lessons having been learnt from the stress caused by ESMA’s big bang. But ESMA has its purposes as far as Asian regulatory progress in concerned.</p>
<p>With respect to data needs, the Asian regulators have been very careful to adopt any measure that looks like it is evolving as a global standard. Already, DTCC estimates that, across the nine jurisdictions they are live in, there are some 40m open positions in its database, accounting for around 70% of the global OTC derivatives market. This provides a strong incentive for Asia’s national regulators to look at the data standards being developed by the likes of ESMA.</p>
<p>In fact, Asia’s regulators appear to realise that a lot of what they want to see has probably already been reported somewhere in some shape or form. They are seeing what they can leverage, looking at the fields reported by ESMA, these representing a large share of the reported volume.</p>
<h3 id=""careful-listening"">Careful listening</h3>
<p>The regulatory burden may well, as many financial services professionals believe (anecdotal evidence accepted), continue to increase in Asia over the coming years. Yet the traditional characterisation of Asia as a strictly regulated region, relative to that of liberally managed economies in the US and Europe, has shown some real progress.</p>
<p>A matter of note, say industry experts, is that regulators in Asia have been more considered and thoughtful in the way they have planned and implemented their reforms. Unlike in the US or Europe where financial institutions and corporates alike have lamented time and time again that regulatory bodies have pressed ahead with regulatory changes with little consideration to the ‘unintended consequences’ those in the industry believe may emerge as a consequence of reform, Asia’s regulators have paused, and listened carefully to the views of all affected parties.</p>
<p>Even when specific regulations – like the Basel Accord’s capital ratios – have been set at a high level, they have, consciously, not been set so high as to be out of reach of those subjected to them. Likewise, the recent amendments to Singapore’s AML legislation was only implemented after the Monetary Authority of Singapore went through a ten-month consultation phase. Financial services professionals in other regions could be forgiven, perhaps, for looking at how things have unfolded with a degree of envy.</p>
<p>Indeed, there seems to be an increasingly collaborative approach where regulators are very keen to have an open conversation with the market to understand the challenges and what can be done to address these without exposing the financial markets to regulatory uncertainty.</p>
<p>It is also evident, as we have seen above, that the regulators have learned from the mistakes – and successes – of their global peers. They are interested in gaining knowledge from the other regions as to what is best practice and what is not. Generally, the approach taken has been a sophisticated one; it’s not about mirroring what has been done in Europe or America, but looking at all the issues and considering what makes sense for the local markets and what is economically proportionate. It is, to all intents and purposes, a highly researched approach to doing the right thing, rather than being overly political.</p>
<h3 id=""renewing-the-spirit-of-cooperation"">Renewing the spirit of cooperation</h3>
<p>Despite the efficacy of this more consultative model, as growth accelerates, it is natural that the emerging markets will continue to draw upon the know-how of more experienced players. In the spirit of cooperation, ESMA and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong concluded a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in November 2015 allowing the exchange of information on derivative contracts held in TRs. The MoU allows ESMA and SFC to have indirect access to TRs established in the European Union and Hong Kong respectively. It became effective on November 19<sup>th</sup> 2015.</p>
<p>In November 2014 and February 2015, ESMA had already concluded MoUs with the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (ASIC) and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) providing for a direct access to TR data. However, the ESMA-SFC MoU was cited as the first cooperation arrangement among authorities to establish an indirect access to TRs through exchanges of information. It followed the recommendation of the FSB to enter into this type of agreement to overcome legal barriers to accessing data on derivatives trades, for example when direct access by foreign authorities to TR data is not currently possible.</p>
<h3 id=""tech-intervention"">Tech intervention</h3>
<p>Emerging markets, and particularly those with weaker fundamentals like Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia, have experienced a fair degree of volatility lately. The derivatives market in Vietnam, for example, is seen as an important step in creating qualitative change for the Vietnamese securities market after a long era of quantitative development. Technology has a role to play here and in March 2016 the GMEX Group entered into a joint venture agreement with FPT Information System (FPT) based in Hanoi, Vietnam to provide technology, global business and local operational expertise to launch the first derivatives market and fully integrated clearing house in the country.</p>
<p>Vietnam’s Ministry of Finance (MOF) called upon the Hanoi Stock Exchange (HNX) (formerly the Hanoi Securities Trading Centre) and the Vietnam Securities Depository (VSD) to operate the derivative market’s transaction activities. The project aims to provide a multi-asset, multi-language exchange trading system suite and market surveillance solution to HNX, which will operate the derivatives exchange. The project is expected to deliver a real-time clearing system to VSD, which will operate the clearing house.</p>
<p>The new market is intended to facilitate transactions based on stock accounts such as stock indexes, Government bonds and shares. Indeed, the first traded instruments will be share indexes (HNX30 and VN30) and Government bonds with five-year terms. The target go live date is Q416.</p>
<h3 id=""time-to-act"">Time to act</h3>
<p>With the extraterritorial reach of regulations from elsewhere adding an extra layer of complexity to the web of new rules now emerging in the region, corporates really have no time to lose. The first step should be to perform a careful examination of the company’s treasury technology and its capabilities when it comes to types of data that might need to be reported. As mentioned above, comfort may be taken in the knowledge that the scale of the problem will not be the same as that experienced by firms reporting under EMIR; this required a major effort in gathering all the right information and collating it.</p>
<p>Treasurers here in Asia won’t have to climb that same, steep learning curve if they begin their preparations in good time, as the regulatory landscape unfurls. The progressive regional roll-out model will buy time but it will have to be tackled at some point. This might involve taking a report from one of the swap data repositories and then figuring out what, if any, gaps there exist. This should help in the understanding of what needs to be reported and in preparing for any future requirements.</p>
<p>Whilst Singapore is ahead of the Asian curve in this respect, for many countries, the necessary format to report in is still under discussion. For this reason, such a project is something that should be on any future project list for treasurers.</p>
<p>It is already known that International Swaps and Derivatives Association’s (ISDA’) work across Asia Pacific focuses on certain core topics such as documentation, public policy, market structure, market practice and research – so opening up the discussion now within treasury makes sense. Regardless of how the markets develop globally, it is clear that the Asian derivatives markets are changing and that there is an opportunity to increase scale and availability, guided by intelligent and considered regulation. Treasurers must familiarise themselves with the changes as they happen. Of course, this is not as easy as it sounds but help from banks, vendors, industry bodies, and other treasury professionals is out there.</p>

<p>The Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project is an OECD Action Plan addressing concerns that the profits of multinationals are being allocated to locations different from those where the actual business takes place in order to reduce their overall tax liability. The main impetus behind the BEPS initiative is to align the profits of multinational companies with value producing activities and to encourage companies to increase their economic substance in jurisdictions that have typically been considered low-tax or preferential regimes.</p>
<p>While the BEPS initiative will have a significant effect on the tax departments of multinational companies, it will no doubt also encourage treasurers to determine what changes are required from a business standpoint and to create a plan of action to address these changes. As an example, one of the BEPS Action Items, Action 13, will require businesses to re-examine their transfer pricing documentation, causing treasurers to balance conformity with these rules against their compliance costs, which could potentially be significant depending on the amount and accuracy of information readily available. Under Action 13, large multinationals are required to annually file a country-by-country report for each tax jurisdiction in which they do business, and will need to provide the amount of revenue, profit before income tax and income tax paid and accrued and other indicators of economic activities.</p>
<p>In addition to increased compliance costs, treasurers will need to be involved in the day-to-day decision making as to how to increase economic substance (eg people, processes) in specific jurisdictions. Action 10 focuses on transfer pricing with respect to “other high-risk areas”, which addresses situations in which profits are diverted from the most economically important activities of the multinational group, and the use of certain types of payments between members of the group (such as management fees and head office expenses) to erode the tax base. The revised guidelines on transfer pricing address the situation where a capital-rich member of a group provides assets such as funding for use by an operating company but performs only limited activities. As such, tax departments will call on treasury to determine whether the amount of economic substance in these jurisdictions is adequate and whether it can be allocated to value-producing activities. If substance does not align with the risks and value produced by the entity in question, then treasury must determine how to functionally realign substance with value creation and work with tax to implement this into the business.</p>
<p>Finally, Action 4 (limit base erosion via interest deductions and other financial payments) will require treasury’s input and analysis with regard to specific cash flows, currency exposure, and existing related party and third party financial debt. The treasury and tax departments of multinationals will need to work closely together to evaluate existing financial transactions in order to determine their conformity with BEPS. Going forward, the BEPS Actions will require increased coordination within the business where each department must collaborate in order to create a workable solution that will better align the company’s profits with its economic substance.</p>

<p>BEPS is a global tax reset, and that means the biggest change to international tax principles in more than a generation. Business model operations, treasury operations, intercompany leverage structures and risk management structures will all be impacted. The OECD’s 15-point action plan will promote greater transparency with increased information exchange between tax authorities and enable an environment that taxes profits in the country where the value is added.</p>
<p>To prepare, corporate treasurers will need to review the new BEPS action plan and related articles and engage with their tax team about what the actions mean for their businesses, including departments such as finance and intercompany leverage. BEPS is a key business risk for the global C-suite and investors are increasingly interested in tax strategy. Treasurers should begin working closely with their corporate executives to assess current state and identify the actions that will impact the people, property, and functions of the organisation. Ask these questions: how do we sell to customers? How will this impact our supply chain? Do new systems need to be implemented or can existing systems be leveraged?</p>
<p>When that portion of the analysis is done, treasury teams can begin redesigning their own department. A treasury team will need to determine just how this impacts liquidity, where the foreign currency exposures are, and what this will do to business. The OECD has estimated that effective corporate tax rates may rise between four and 10%. Should this occur, it would impact liquidity, leverage, and possibly even the credit ratings of some companies. Evaluating the readiness to satisfy the proposed data and reporting requirements can help establish how the current state of the treasury compares to the desired future state and analysing gaps and prioritising action items are the first steps in preparing for implementation.</p>
<p>Multinational companies without personnel in the various jurisdictions of their financing entities and in-house banks need to also consider whether they should shift professionals into those jurisdictions. Decentralisation draws questions around the governance structures and processes and controls. This also creates the need for better technology and reporting to manage these risks. However, treasury should see this as a great opportunity to get closer to the business and become more of a value-adding partner to the organisation.</p>
<p>Documentation of all intercompany loans is going to be very important to prove the loans’ existence to tax authorities. Treasurers have to think about how good their documentation is and whether intercompany loan portfolios need adjusting. Foreign currency gain or loss on the repayment of an intercompany loan may create a tax liability. An organisation’s response and approach to managing the OECD’s prescription for better tax health could ultimately impact the company’s competitiveness, brand value and reputation.</p>

<p>The final BEPS Action Plan was delivered on time and is remarkably comprehensive. Although further work is planned during 2016 and its success will in a large part rely on domestic implementation by the participating jurisdictions, it has already had a significant impact on the international tax environment and no doubt will continue to do so.</p>
<p>The BEPS Action Plan has three main themes: coherence in domestic rules that affect cross-border activities, substance and improving transparency. Of the 15 action points, those likely to be of most relevance to treasury operations are the proposals on hybrid mismatch arrangements (Action 2), interest deductibility and other financial payments (Action 4), tax treaty abuse (Action 6), transfer pricing methodologies (Actions 8-10) and those on transfer pricing documentation (Action 13).</p>
<p>Intercompany transactions, in particular financing transactions, have been the focus of a number of the proposed actions, which is highly relevant to treasury departments who may find current structures are vulnerable. For example, cash management may include use of hybrid structures or instruments that give rise to either a tax deduction for financing costs without a corresponding taxable receipt or a tax deduction in more than one jurisdiction. Such deductions may now be denied or unexpected tax payments may arise. Structures may also rely on access to treaty benefits (such as to enable exemption from withholding tax) which will be lost if new tests are not satisfied, giving rise to increased tax costs in the group. The proposals which limit excessive interest deductions may reduce the tax benefit of existing arrangements. In light of the proposals, it may be appropriate to unwind existing arrangements and to consolidate certain group operations.</p>
<p>New transfer pricing documentation, including country-by-country reporting (CBCR), is aimed at enhancing transparency for tax administrations. The treasury department will need an understanding of the reporting requirements, in particular in relation to intra-group transactions which may face greater scrutiny. There are concerns as to how tax authorities will use the information provided via CBCR; for instance, it might lead to more withholding taxes being levied as previously ignored transactions are brought into tax.</p>
<p>Changes to the OECD transfer pricing guidelines aim to ensure that transfer pricing outcomes better align with value creation of the multinational enterprise group; returns will not accrue to an entity solely because it has contractually assumed risks or has provided capital. This is likely to impact on available deductions and the location of taxable profits. Groups that have a centralised treasury function may need to review whether their transfer pricing policies remain good for purpose post BEPS and how any required changes might impact on costs.</p>
<p>Treasury and tax functions of multinational groups need to work together to assess risks and issues in respect of current treasury operations, consider what changes might be made now and to put in place processes and strategies to monitor and plan for future developments and changes. This will need to be done both by reference to the BEPS agenda generally and by reviewing the changes being introduced by respective jurisdictions in which the business operates, noting that there is some disparity as to how certain actions might be addressed in a domestic context. Finally, it will also be necessary to educate the wider business about the impact of BEPS and seek to develop best practices that can be met by the business in its day-to-day activities.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>New regulatory changes requiring urgent attention continue to land in treasurers’ in-trays around the globe on a near daily basis. In this article, we ask: does regulatory compliance always have to be a burden? What happens when treasurers conceive of compliance projects instead as an opportunity to improve the operational efficiency of their departments?</em></p>
<p>It would be fair to say that corporate treasurers – much like the bankers they do business with – have been feeling ever more disgruntled by the continuing torrent of new rules and standards global regulators have been asking them to comply with of late.</p>
<p>Some of the responses Treasury Today received in its most recent European Corporate Treasury Benchmarking Study are indicative of this point. Of the treasurers surveyed, a total of 37% said that compliance and regulations were ‘very important’, with a further 44% labelling the issue ‘fairly important’. Important or otherwise, though, on the matter of how treasurers perceived the value of these ever frequent compliance projects, the comments received left little ambiguity.</p>
<p>“An increasing overhead, some of which is a tick-in-the-box exercise and thus doesn’t add any value,” one treasurer at a well-known automobile company lamented. “I prefer to remain polite and not comment on valueless, EMIR-like constraints!” another tellingly remarked.</p>
<p>It is hard not to empathise. While no new significant financial regulations have been introduced in the past year, with many existing ones having been refined or amended, the compliance burden is taking up more and more of the treasurer’s working day. And that is why treasurers’ eyes tend to roll every time a new compliance requirement lands in their in-tray. It’s not resentment of conducting business in a right and proper way. It’s the time, cost and distraction from other pressing matters that such projects inevitably bring. A survey carried out at EuroFinance in Budapest last year suggested as much, with around 74% of treasury professionals stating they were expecting to spend more time on compliance this year than in 2014, and are needing to dedicate extra resources to dealing with regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>Regulation is then, unquestionably, a challenge for everyone in the treasury profession. What it is also known, however, but often forgotten, is that regulation – whether we agree with it or not – is often a game changer. And when the rules of the game change, opportunities present themselves which companies can, regrettably, let slip if they approach the project with the wrong mind-set.</p>
<p>One treasurer, for instance, told Treasury Today that in his experience, certain compliance projects have presented opportunities to put in place the structures that would turn around a loss-making business to a profit. But those opportunities were missed, he says, because of protestations from senior executives.</p>
<p>But there have been examples in recent years of corporate treasuries who have taken a better approach to compliance, and as a result, have been able to transform such projects from necessary but valueless ‘box checking’ exercises into springboards for improving treasury operations and broader business decision making. Two of this year’s Treasury Today Adam Smith Award winners, the French pharmaceutical multinational Sanofi, and US healthcare insurer Health Care Service Corporation (HCSC) offer examples of the benefits of this approach. The two companies faced different compliance challenges: for Sanofi’s treasury it was the issue of sanctions, while at HCSC it was the US Affordable Healthcare Act; both treasuries, however, responded to their respective challenges in ways that are demonstrative of best practice for compliance projects.</p>




<h3 id=""the-business-benefits-for-banks"">The business benefits for banks</h3>
<p>If the regulatory burden has grown considerably for corporate treasurers of late, it is still dwarfed by the new compliance requirements the banks have been grappling with practically day-in day-out since the crisis. Unfortunately for them, there is not much hope of any imminent let-up either. According to the annual Cost of Compliance Survey, by information and technology provider Thomson Reuters, compliance officers are expressing regulatory fatigue and overload in the face of snowballing regulations. Seventy percent of firms are expecting regulators to publish even more regulatory information in the next year, with 28% expecting significantly more.</p>
<p>Can anything be done to make such exercises worthwhile beyond the mere achievement of compliance? Ed Royan, Chief Operating Officer, EMEA, for AxiomSL, global provider of regulatory reporting and risk management technology solutions for financial institutions (FIs), says there is.</p>
<p>“The reporting that is done as part of regulatory compliance is probably the most granular reporting an organisation does,” he explains. The imperative to get this activity absolutely spot-on, then, could lead to benefits elsewhere. “Correcting data quality issues at the granular level that is required for regulatory reporting will lead to improvements to the management information (MI) that is based on the same data as the regulatory reports. If regulation is driving data improvements, then financial institutions will see enhanced MI coming through, which is going to lead to better business decisions.”</p>
<p>“A country code is an example of the type of granular data that is essential for regulatory reporting and that should be scrutinised carefully as part of that process,” Royan says. “If an FI’s regulatory reporting platform identifies an error in the country code, it will have significant business benefits. For example, if an FI does not realise that it is has an incorrect country code, it may underestimate its exposure to a particular jurisdiction. Alternatively, an incorrect code may lead an FI to overestimate its exposure to a country and it may unnecessarily turn business down as a result.”</p>
<p>Royan adds that there is another aspect of the recent regulatory upheaval that can be leveraged: harmonisation. “While there has certainly been a lot of change, there has also been a move to common reporting frameworks in some areas,” he says. That means that banks that previously needed a multitude of different systems for rolling out regulatory reporting in different countries can now approach such tasks in a somewhat more efficient manner. “Now we have harmonised reports in places like France, Germany and the UK, for example, so banks no longer need three different projects in each of those countries; they can now all be managed in a single project.” And as a result of that, banks can begin redeploying resources – including their compliance fatigued staff – to the activities that really matter, serving customers, product innovation, and improving profitability.</p>

<h3 id=""avoiding-the-blacklisted"">Avoiding the blacklisted</h3>
<p>In 2013, the Sanofi European Treasury Centre (SETC) began deploying a payment factory: a project that, according to the SETC, was to have a very strong focus on fulfilling the highest standards in terms of compliance, security and internal controls.</p>
<p>Treasurers have had to get increasingly sanctions-wise over the past year. Although economic sanctions are by no means a new phenomenon, businesses are typically more accustomed to bans on doing business with parties in places like Iran, Cuba or North Korea. The introduction of sanctions in 2014 on Russia by the US and Europe – the first time sanctions had ever been imposed on a G10 economy – naturally brought the issue into the forefront of treasurers’ minds.</p>
<p>That was why Sanofi decided that, in addition to efforts to improve the efficiency of bank master data management through centralisation, a second pillar of the payment factory project would to be introduce a restricted party screening solution, developed in order to ensure Sanofi does not enter into business with ‘blacklisted’ or sanctioned parties. This applies at both a master data (in the ERP) and payment factory level. In doing so, the group has not only improved compliance (avoiding potentially heavy fines and, not to mention, reputational damage) but also automated what was becoming an increasingly time consuming task, allowing treasury resources to now be redeployed on to other, more value generating activities.</p>
<p>“The key risk related areas that we needed to address were improvements in terms of compliance, internal control and security,” says Wolfgang Weber, General Manager and Head of Sanofi In-House Bank. “Through automation of processes that were (partly) done manually before, we are now less error prone and can make better use of our resources within accounting and treasury teams throughout the organisation. Given a global environment where regulations and constraints become increasingly tighter, locating these tasks in the Group payment factory and mobilising resources to build robust infrastructures bring additional added-value for the entire group.”</p>
<h3 id=""leveraging-industry-regulation"">Leveraging industry regulation</h3>
<p>Another ambitious project was undertaken by HCSC in response to the introduction of the US Affordable Healthcare Act, otherwise known as ‘Obama Care’ that was passed in 2010 and came into effect in 2014. Against this shifting regulation, HCSC treasury prepared proactively to anticipate transformative change in the industry looking at, not just achieving compliance, but how the project could be used to radically reshape the department and its priorities.</p>
<p>“The company’s treasury organisation launched its own plan to evolve from a process-orientated treasury function to a consultative think-tank treasury function focused more towards problem solving throughout the business and bringing value-added treasury solutions to our internal stakeholders and process partners,” says David T. Deranek, Senior Manager of Treasury Operations and Control at HCSC.</p>
<p>The catalyst for this change involved multiple projects that focused on creating a leveraged and customised TMS tool that would centralise all treasury activity from over 14 bank portals and over 150 bank accounts, eliminate Excel-based uploaded accounting process and automate manually intensive transactions, accounting, and reporting. Further, the TMS would provide the basis for a forecasting tool to more efficiently manage working capital and thereby increase incremental returns on the $10bn investment portfolio.</p>
<p>HCSC treasury decided that in order to improve its ability to manage liquidity and properly support the company in a changing healthcare industry environment, it needed to re-engineer how it administered its treasury operations. In addition, centralisation of company treasury functions across their member Blue Cross Blue Shield organisations, including over 30 subsidiaries, made this task to reformulate treasury’s working model absolutely essential.</p>
<p>The HCSC treasury team faced a crossroads to accomplish more through automation and therefore participate in transformational healthcare industry change via their role as financial consultants for the business enterprise. Treasury leadership determined that a fully leveraged and automated solution was imperative. A new working model was required to replace the multiple stand-alone systems – none of which communicated with one another, resulting in manual keying of data multiple times, creating data integrity concerns and requiring additional resources. Due to the disjointed technology infrastructure, management also had limited ability to obtain and analyse key treasury data soundly, efficiently, and reliably. In short, it was clear that all cash and liquidity management processes, together with the deployment of talent resources, needed to be re-engineered.</p>
<p>HCSC treasury department’s transformation project is a unique combination of technology, process and talent improvements. And today, HCSC treasury is now a centralised department supporting all five state plans (Illinois, Texas, Oklahoma, Montana, and New Mexico) of Blue Cross Blue Shield including its 30 plus subsidiaries and 20,000 employees. “Principal to our success is that the new treasury operations working model established comprehensive, enterprise services now centralised out of our Chicago headquarters with no duplication of treasury services in its member business units or subsidiaries,” explains Deranek.</p>
<p>Throughout the course of the project, HCSC treasury team was restructured from 2011 through to 2014, to comprise 15 diverse professionals that include advanced graduate and undergraduate degrees, CPAs, CFAs, CTPs, and have backgrounds in banking, finance, tax, investing, accounting, and IT. Deranek notes: “Together we comprise a dynamic and balanced team of subject matter experts that have been a guiding force behind a centralised treasury organisation modelled to emulate a centralised financial services model.”</p>
<p>Also, by reducing 86% of the treasury staff’s daily manual transaction volume through automation, treasury has transformed itself into a knowledge centre of subject matter experts who are much more nimble to participate in enterprise wide project teams that bring value where it was previously missing. In 2014, treasury operations consulted on no less than 150 cross functional initiatives ranging from the Affordable Health Care Act, Industry Prompt Payment requirements, OSC outsourcing initiatives, business unit profitability and enhanced investment returns to Medicaid payment regulation and cash forecasting. Previous participation on such projects was typically limited to the directors and treasury consultants.</p>
<p>Another important aspect of the success of this transformation project is the close development and understanding of requirements necessary between treasury, IT, and HCSC’s banking partners, including Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Because of this, HCSC treasury processes have reached a high level of functional performance and automation, which not only creates seamless transparency of transaction flow for treasury but also cultivates an environment of continuous improvement.</p>
<h3 id=""worth-the-effort"">Worth the effort</h3>
<p>Perhaps the principal reason why treasurers are becoming so exasperated with the growing regulatory burden they are finding themselves under is, as the Treasury Today Benchmarking Study results suggest, a pervasive sense that each compliance project undertaken is a mere box ticking exercise of little business value.</p>
<p>The danger for treasurers, however, is that this becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. As the above examples have shown, there are other ways of thinking about compliance. Those treasurers who feel they are automatically sure each time a new regulatory requirement is introduced that attaining compliance is going to be a difficult and an ultimately worthless exercise from a business perspective may not notice opportunities, like Sanofi or HCSC did, to improve the efficiency of a particular process or even radically overhaul the entire treasury function.</p>
<p>Treasurers have a very limited scope to influence the development of the regulatory environments in which they operate. What they can control, of course, is how well they respond to such developments.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>If the financial sectors of the US and Europe have struggled with the weight of regulatory reforms introduced post-crisis, that has not been the case in Asia. While the CEOs and other senior executives of big Wall Street banks lament about the one-size-fits-all approach regulators are attempting to impose on them, in Asia things have been a little different. ‘Regulatory burden?’ some of the regional banks have been heard to remark in recent years, ‘what regulatory burden?’</p>
<p>The region’s recent history has somewhat helped their hand. “Asia had its own crisis in the 1990s, and learned from it,” says Ruth Wandhöfer, Global Head of Regulatory and Market Policy at Citi Treasury and Trade Services. “Asia feels that some of the measures being executed to the extreme in the US and Europe – ring-fencing, predispositioning of capital and leverage ratios – are not really necessary to the same extent.”</p>
<p>Of course, banks across Asia have had to comply with Basel III capital and liquidity requirements as has been the case in other regions. And, in some jurisdictions, these have actually been even more stringent than those imposed on their peers in the US and Europe. The common consensus, though, is that Asia’s banks have coped a great deal better with the transition.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the reasons they have managed better is that they have not had such a distance to travel to reach the end goal. Basel III proved a struggle for many of the large global banks headquartered in the US and Europe. But while those institutions were still finding their feet in the aftermath of Lehman Brothers and the unfolding the Eurozone crisis, banks in Asia were busy boosting their already robust core capital ratios through retained earnings and common stock issuances.</p>
<p>Ultimately it meant reaching those new balance sheet requirements was not quite as onerous a task as it proved to be elsewhere. “European banks have quite a hard task to obtain those capital ratios,” says Wandhöfer. “Most achieved it, but it has come at a cost.”</p>


<blockquote>A multinational with business in 60-70 countries always needs to think about the bigger picture though. Sure it might be possible to get better rates with a regional bank in certain countries, but there are other aspects that give you a view on whether the bank you are with is giving you a good deal or not.</blockquote>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>This is why, when one looks at the rates offered on liquidity deposits they tend (depending on the currency, of course) to be much more competitive at some Asian banks. Similarly, while in the West it is now widely accepted that trade finance will become more expensive as capital costs are priced in, that is not what has happened in Asia. On the contrary, there is almost an overflow of liquidity. That may be down to the region still being in reasonably good shape economically (notwithstanding the recent slowdown in China) and, as such, the commercial need to borrow is simply not there. It could also be explained, however, by the fact that Asian banks are not feeling quite so constrained by regulation. Either way, if a corporate can be satisfied that a regional Asian bank has the right capabilities and the footprint to service their needs – never exactly a given – they might find the rates that Asian banks can provide very attractive indeed.</p>
<p>“That is something we’ve been hearing from clients for some time,” Wandhöfer notes. “A multinational with business in 60-70 countries always needs to think about the bigger picture though. Sure it might be possible to get better rates with a regional bank in certain countries, but there are other aspects that give you a view on whether the bank you are with is giving you a good deal or not.”</p>
<h3 id=""watch-and-learn"">Watch and learn</h3>
<p>The journey to meeting the G20 objectives for establishing more transparency in OTC derivatives markets has also been smoother relative to the disruption we saw in the US and EU with the introduction of Dodd-Frank and the European Markets Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR).</p>
<p>This might be accounted for, on the one hand, by the fact that derivative markets in the Asia region are comparatively small, comprising a mere 8% of the current global turnover. But some credit must also be given to the approach taken by the region’s national regulatory authorities who, having carefully scrutinised how the G20 commitments were effected elsewhere, opted to take a more phased implementation unlike the ‘big bang’ approach favoured by Europe, for example.</p>
<p>Since implementation began several years ago, regulators have moved step-by-step to bringing trade reporting across different markets segments, asset classes. Last year, trade reporting was live for interest rates and credit only in Singapore. Five asset classes were live in Australia, meanwhile, but only for large institutions. Since then what we have seen is the asset classes and market participants subject to trade reporting slowly expand. Singapore went live, for example, with FX products in May of this year. In Australia, the regulators have changed their OTC derivatives requirements to include a much larger community of reporters.</p>
<p>So while banks, corporates and institutions faced a steep challenge in becoming compliant across all of their OTC derivatives activities in Europe, market participants in Asia have been somewhat less encumbered by the changes taking place. “Regulators in Asia have watched the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), and the big bang approach taken by them where all segments, all sizes, all asset classes had to start reporting on the same day. I think the first lesson they learned is that it is an enormous universe, and a huge task by any measure,” says Peter Tierney, Regional Head, Asia at DTCC. “That phased implementation in Asia is a direct learning from global experience.”</p>
<p>A different approach to implementation notwithstanding, with respect to data the Asian regulators have been very careful to adopt any measure that looks like it is evolving as a global standard. Already, DTCC estimates that, across the nine jurisdictions they are live in, there are some 40m open positions in its database, accounting for around 70% of the global OTC derivatives market. This provides a strong incentive for Asia’s national regulators to look at the data standards being developed by other regulators such as ESMA. “Asia’s regulators realise that a lot of what they want to see has probably been reported somewhere in some shape or form. So they are seeing what they can leverage, looking at the fields reported by ESMA – a large share of the reported volume. The regulators are very pragmatic about adhering to global standards.”</p>
<p>If there is one major obstacle hampering the region in its journey towards the G20 objectives on the regulation of OTC derivatives, though, it is the region’s diversity. At the end of the day, the whole rationale behind the G20 accord to begin with was to bring transparency to a global market that had become notorious for its opaqueness. But in a fragmented, diverse region with each jurisdiction deeming it necessary to establish its own in-country rules, this has not been straightforward.</p>
<p>There is cause for optimism that this will not end up being the end-state for the region, however, says Tierney. “Two years ago it was difficult to discuss the importance of standards because none of the trade repositories were live. We simply couldn’t articulate, therefore, what the world was doing,” he explains. “But we’ve found over the past year that it has become a lot easier to go and visit jurisdictions and explain how firms are reporting their positions and what positions are probably already on our database.”</p>
<h3 id=""the-next-wave"">The next wave</h3>
<p>Asia’s relatively smooth transition to meeting the Basel III capital and liquidity targets and the G20 OTC derivatives requirements makes what we are beginning to see now in the region all the more intriguing. Although the region largely escaped the same regulatory disruption witnessed in the US and Europe, there are signs that the overall regulatory burden – on financial institutions in particular – is now beginning to weigh down a bit more on market participants.</p>
<p>Every year, the information provider and technology firm Thomson Reuters publishes its Cost of Compliance Survey which assesses the impact of regulation on financial services in Asia. According to Thomson Reuters Annual Cost of Compliance Survey, compliance officers express regulatory fatigue and overload in the face of snowballing regulations. Seventy percent of firms are expecting regulators to publish even more regulatory information in the next year, with 28% expecting significantly more.</p>
<p>If neither capital adequacy nor derivatives reporting requirements have been especially troubling Asia’s financial services sector then what is? Sanjeev Chatrath, Managing Director and Head of Financial &amp; Risk, Asia Pacific at Thomson Reuters, identifies two key factors. The first of these comes not from inside the region but from the activities of overseas bodies. “Over the past year, corporates in Asia have been extremely busy addressing some of these far-reaching, extra-territorial regulations that have been introduced; FATCA and the UK Bribery Act being two notable examples,” he says. “There are many US/UK headquartered or affiliated institutions operating here, of course, and they are trying to balance their compliance with regard to home country and host country regulations.”</p>
<p>Secondly, the region’s own regulators have also stepped up a gear, but are focusing on different issues to what we have seen in other regions. “I think there are different nuances in every part of Asia,” says Chatrath. “Korea has introduced significant changes around data privacy, driven by some of its experiences last year. In India and other Asian countries, there is a lot of focus now around corruption reforms. And China too has been making substantial changes allowing foreign investors to invest in China. In Australia, we are seeing a lot more personal liability initiatives that financial executives have to undertake.”</p>
<p>Chatrath’s observations are supported by Thomson Reuters 2015 Cost of Compliance Survey. The report reveals that compliance officers at financial institutions are increasingly concerned about Conduct Risk (67% of respondents citing this as the biggest driver of managing regulatory risk) as well as new data protection and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements based on the 2012 FATF recommendations.</p>
<h3 id=""good-listeners"">Good listeners</h3>
<p>The regulatory burden may well, as many financial services professionals believe, continue to increase in Asia over the coming years. Yet the traditional characterisation of Asia as a very strictly regulated region, relative to that of liberally managed economies in the US and Europe, has, as we have seen, been somewhat turned on its head in recent years.</p>
<p>Of course, as treasurers will point out, strict foreign exchange controls remain a liquidity management headache in many jurisdictions (even if, crucially, China has begun to liberalise its policies in this area). And in some countries, as noted earlier, banking regulation with respect to capital and liquidity ratios is even stricter than what has been introduced in many western countries.</p>
<p>An important difference though, say industry experts, is that regulators here in Asia have been more considered and thoughtful in the way they have planned and implemented there reforms. Unlike in the US or Europe where financial institutions and corporates alike have lamented time and time again that regulatory bodies have pressed ahead with regulatory changes with little consideration to the ‘unintended consequences’ those in the industry believe may emerge as a consequence of reform, Asia’s regulators have paused, and listened carefully to the views of all affected parties. Even when specific regulations – like the Basel capital ratios – have been set at a high level, they have, consciously, not been set so high as to be out of reach of those subjected to them. Likewise the recent amendments to Singapore’s AML legislation was only implemented after the Monetary Authority of Singapore went through a ten-month consultation phase. Financial services professionals in other regions could be forgiven, perhaps, with looking at how things have unfolded with a degree of envy.</p>

<p>“I think we are seeing an increasingly collaborative approach between the regulators and the regulated,” says Chatrath. “Regulators are very keen to have an open conversation with the regulated to understand their business challenges and what can be done to address the risk involved in the business so that you do not expose the financial markets to regulatory uncertainty.”</p>
<p>It is also evident that the regulators have learned from the mistakes – and successes – of their global peers. “They are very much interested to gain knowledge from the other regions as to what is best practice and what is not,” says Citi’s Wandhöfer. “Generally the approach taken has been a sophisticated one; it’s not about mirroring what has been done in Europe or America, but looking at all the issues and considering what makes sense for their markets and what is economically proportionate. It is a highly researched approach to doing the right thing, rather than being overly political.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Due diligence processes, and predictability around Know Your Customer (KYC) information requirements, have changed fundamentally since the latest financial crisis and the further globalisation of banking. This has led to escalating levels of regulation and enforcement where regulation is seen not to be met – meaning that banks and other financial institutions (FIs) have increased controls.</p>
<p>Today, to prove that they know their clients in depth, more stringent checks must be made and more documentation must be sourced. For corporates, this presents a few challenges and concerns. Some corporates have reported that collecting KYC data to open an account takes between an entire day to up to 30 weeks. There are also concerns about the security behind the exchange of such personal information such as passports and signatures.</p>
<p>The rise of the utility approach to KYC is aimed at addressing the concerns around this process. The utility approach will provide a secure method for the exchange of information, and will also remove the need to share the information each time an account is opened, removing the redundant duplication of effort.</p>
<p>The utilitisation of the KYC process would mean that corporates and treasurers only need to provide data once, to the secure system of choice, and then grant access to their different banking partners. This allows more time for treasurers to concentrate on other operational functions and areas of more complex risk. From a bank’s perspective, they will receive the data in the format and detail expected, thus reducing the time to open accounts and to conduct ongoing due diligence.</p>
<p>For SWIFT’s KYC Registry, SWIFT has defined a common, global baseline of data requirements. Banks contribute an agreed ‘baseline’ set of data and documentation for validation by SWIFT, which the contributors can then share with their counterparties. Each bank retains ownership of its own information, as well as control over which other institutions can view it. Banks are not charged for data contribution or for using the Registry to share their KYC information with other banks.</p>
<p>Moreover, industry leaders and regulators alike have highlighted the importance of knowing your customer’s customer (KYCC). KYCC is a phrase increasingly used by regulatory bodies to reference the need for financial institutions to understand their clients to a deeper, more granular level of detail.</p>
<p>For correspondents, the focus would be more than simply understanding the relationship and risk of your immediate counterparty, but also to understand the greater systemic network risk. For corporates investing in assets or part of a wider correspondent/payment chain, they should be aware that they need to reference or identify their role as an actor in the transaction. It remains to be seen whether these increasingly-discussed requirements will add further complexity in terms of greater detail in the KYC data shared, as this is an evolving expectation.</p>

<p>Know Your Customer (KYC) is an essential part of banks’ and other financial institutions’ operations, particularly from a regulatory and compliance perspective. With increasing regulatory scrutiny and evolving regulations in recent years, banks are having to beef up their KYC and anti-money laundering (AML) policies and practices. This means banks’ clients, including corporates, are having to provide more information, on a regular basis, to every bank they deal with. This raises the level of difficulty in the KYC process for corporate treasurers. However, some of the leading banks and service providers in the industry have come together to alleviate some of the operational challenges of their clients through the conception of utilities in KYC.</p>
<p>The current practices in KYC are complex, requiring every customer to exchange information with every financial institution (FI) they deal with. Providing the correct documentation, and receiving verification can take weeks and on-going updates are required for each FI. Multiple exchanges of documents result in duplication of efforts and higher costs. The utility model, on the other hand, gathers all customer information at a single place that can in turn be shared with FIs. Bank customers can provide, or upload, all required documents to a single utility provider where FIs can access all the necessary information from this utility.</p>
<p>In this model, the providers of information (investment managers, hedge funds, corporates) are typically not charged whereas FIs can access this information by paying a price to the utility provider. The provision of this service is typically made through a web portal, requiring minimal effort from users in terms of technology and systems.</p>
<p>While ideally one would envision a single such utility catering to the whole industry, we have seen three or four utilities emerging in this area: these include utilities from Thomson Reuters, Genpact, Markit, DTCC and a group of six co-founding banks, and SWIFT (utility for correspondent banking). All of them are fairly new and currently cater to the developed markets, particularly the US and the UK. However, they all have plans to expand into emerging markets in the near future with particular focus on Asia. The utilities, once fully operational, have the potential to revolutionise the way KYC process is carried out in the industry.</p>
<p>By establishing a common standard and format, the utilities should minimise the need for operational changes for treasurers to submit and update information over time. Online portals can make the transmission and communication much simpler, especially compared to manual and paper based practices followed at many institutions at present. In addition to being free for corporates (and other bank clients), the utilities should free up time and resources of corporate treasurers allowing them to focus on their core business activities.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>In the current climate, it goes without saying that the banks are undertaking Know Your Customer (KYC) due diligence to meet legal and regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which their corporate clients hold bank accounts. For the treasury department, it is certainly difficult to quantify what value KYC processes provide. Rather than adding value per se, they can be seen as a giving corporates ‘a ticket to the game’. In fact, KYC checks are now an intrinsic part of the business relationship between a financial institution and corporate client.</p>
<p>But it is the grey areas and duplication that make KYC seem so burdensome for everyone involved. In Asia, for instance, we see more de-risking happening in the banking industry – where entire portfolios, entire product lines or entire subsets of customers are de-risked by the banks because the associated risk is considered too great. As this risk-based approach starts to take hold in more jurisdictions, more people are pricing for risk to account for the reality that the cost of compliance, compared to the benefit of holding those accounts, doesn’t necessarily stack up. Moreover, the risk-based approach has created a degree of interpretation within the financial institutions. Whilst there is a common set of recommendations from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), and you have a standard legal framework and regulatory framework within a country, each bank is invited to interpret that as part of its risk-based approach and therefore put in place measures that they believe are appropriate for addressing their risks. This leads to a lack of consistency.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, utilities can help improve the KYC environment by providing a degree of certainty about what level of due diligence is required. Utilities are driving consistency – they have the ability to achieve economies of scale through standardisation. They can also minimise duplication since the corporate only provides compliance information to the utility once, rather than providing it to multiple banks. This reduces the cost of KYC to both the financial institution and the end-client.</p>
<p>Moreover, the global regulatory environment is getting more complicated – in Singapore, for instance, changes were only made recently to the Monetary Authority Singapore (MAS) Regulation 626 in response to increasing international anti-money laundering (AML) due diligence standards predicated by the changes made by the FATF in 2012. What this is doing is placing increasing focus on the financial institutions to understand their corporates and understand who is behind the face of those corporate clients. After all, whilst there are many stable and low risk economies from a money laundering and criminal perspective in Asia, there are also economies that are less so.</p>
<p>Banks, therefore, are concerned about ‘contagion risk’, enquiring about their customer’s customer – where am I sending and receiving money on behalf of my customer and what trade finance transactions are occurring, for instance. And because we are seeing banks fined significantly for not managing these exposures, they will be less inclined to simply accept polite declines for information from their corporate clients. KYC and Know Your Customer’s Customer (KYCC) processes are not only on the banks’ agenda; it is our experience that, in a number of jurisdictions, they are on the political agenda too – not least because of tax transparency and corruption issues.</p>
<p>So, whilst we have painted a fairly challenging picture for corporates in Asia, there is also the value that co-operation is bringing as corporate treasurers and the customers of financial institutions start to have more of a voice in Asia. Policymakers are beginning to realise the impacts that some of these regulations are potentially having on the economic viability and health of particular industries. KYC could act as a catalyst for encouraging a co-operative effort to tackle some of the inefficiencies that the industry has had for many years. The benefits of which will be felt by corporates, financial institutions and the regulatory and political regimes in many countries alike.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The regulatory challenges facing companies in Asia are manifold. As a result, the cost of compliance in the region is high – and new regulations are pushing this up even further. According to the most recent Thomson Reuters Cost of Compliance Survey, 29% of Asian firms spent more than ten hours per week tracking and analysing the impact of regulatory developments in 2014, up from 21% in 2013. The equivalent figures for US and UK firms in 2014 were 25% and 21% respectively.</p>
<p>When it came to the number of companies whose compliance teams were spending more than seven hours per week amending policies and procedures to reflect the latest regulatory rules, the disparity between Asia and the US and UK was even greater: almost three in ten (29%) of Asian firms fell into this category last year, compared with 23% in 2013. Only 19% of US firms and 17% of UK firms spent more than seven hours per week amending policies and procedures in 2014. So which regulations in particular have been piling on the pressure in Asia?</p>
<h3 id=""global-otc-derivatives"">Global OTC derivatives</h3>
<p>Derivatives reform has been one of the headaches. For example, reports that the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) asked the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) to delay derivatives trading reforms highlight the specific challenges of implementing new rules beyond the US and Europe.</p>
<p>In mid-2014 the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) launched a consultation on proposed changes to trade reporting rules and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong began a consultation on requirements relating to mandatory reporting and related record keeping obligations. The Securities and Futures (Amendment) Ordinance 2014 was enacted in March 2014, which provides a broad regulatory framework for the over-the-counter or OTC derivatives market in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The new regime introduces mandatory reporting, clearing and trading obligations of OTC derivative transactions in line with G20 commitments in reforming the global OTC derivatives markets. It is expected that mandatory reporting and related record keeping obligations will be introduced into the Hong Kong Legislative Council for vetting in the first half of 2015. The rules will become effective upon the completion of the vetting process.</p>
<p>“Our current priorities are to consult on the first phase of mandatory clearing requirements and the expansion of the product scope of mandatory reporting,” explains a HKMA spokesperson. “We will deal with reporting requirements on other entities afterwards.”</p>
<p>Australia’s rules relating to mandatory reporting of OTC derivatives have already been enacted. In February, ASIC amended its derivative transaction rules. Sonia Goumenis, Partner at Australian commercial law firm Clayton Utz, says the G20 agreement to improve transparency in the OTC derivatives market has had a significant impact in the country, particularly on banks that are well entrenched in the cross-border OTC derivatives markets. This is either by virtue of being physically present in those jurisdictions and booking trades through overseas branches, or trading with counterparties (clients) located in foreign jurisdictions and therefore possibly being caught by regulations in those jurisdictions.</p>
<p>“To some extent, ASIC has borrowed heavily from the regulatory approach in the US and across Europe,” adds Clayton Utz’s John Tawadrous, a lawyer with experience working on the OTC reform programme at one of the major Australian banks while on secondment last year.</p>
<p>Other Asian jurisdictions which are not members of the G20 have been guided by its recommendations in terms of mandatory reporting and clearing as well as capital requirements for non-centrally cleared trades according to Tom Jenkins, Partner at KPMG China. “Countries in this region with an OTC derivatives market – including India, China, Japan, Korea, Malaysia and Singapore – have initiated reforms, with an initial focus on mandatory reporting.</p>
<p>“Japan is probably furthest down the line in terms of OTC derivatives market reform in Asia. The country has implemented mandatory reporting and some mandatory clearing since November 2012 and indicated that mandatory trading on electronic platforms will be introduced by September 2015.” Jenkins observes that the range of instruments covered by the first phase of mandatory reporting and clearing is more limited in Asia than it was in either Europe or the US. But he also points to the fact that Hong Kong and Australia in particular are not that far behind their Western counterparts, while China introduced mandatory clearing for interest rate swaps much more quickly.</p>
<h3 id=""dodd-frank"">Dodd-Frank</h3>
<p>PwC’s Asia Pacific Financial Services Risk Leader, Chris Matten, says Dodd-Frank has created a knock-on effect across the region. US banks operating in Asia face restrictions on proprietary trading; this has forced some to consider their booking models to see whether certain transactions can be booked through an Asian subsidiary. In particular, the Volcker provision of Dodd-Frank has forced banks to look at where transactions are booked.</p>
<p>Many Asian financial institutions do not trigger the thresholds for the Volcker Rule to apply, so only a few would be challenged by the requirements explains Akihiko Katayama, Director at AlixPartners. “But for those impacted, some have implemented very complex manual processes that have added operational risks and unnecessary costs.”</p>
<p>According to Niall Coburn, Regulatory Intelligence Expert at Thomson Reuters, many corporates across Asia remain uncertain about how EMIR and Dodd-Frank affect them. There are also some questions in relation to requirements around additional registration, reporting and documentation and the circumstances that firms have to act upon in order to be compliant. “The most significant outcome in terms of documentation following years of regulatory activity in the US and EU manifests itself in the form of protocols to which certain counterparties are bound to adhere to when entering into certain OTC derivative transactions.</p>
<p>“Hong Kong and Singapore appear to have both brought their regulations in line with the major jurisdictions with a ‘substituted compliance’ approach. As a result of EMIR and Dodd-Frank, the Singapore, Hong Kong and Australian markets have handled these new complex regulations and appear to be operating effectively.”</p>
<h3 id=""levels-of-preparation"">Levels of preparation</h3>
<p>One regulation for which Asian financial institutions have been well prepared is Basel III. Stricter capital requirements are nothing new to those banks in the region who experienced the Asian crisis of the late 1990s. Matten explains that there are a number of Asian countries (including Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Indonesia) that are full members of the Basel community. “Historically, many regulators in the region followed the provisions of Basel – albeit with a slight delay. Banking is a global business and if you are a jurisdiction that is not part of this community it makes sense to follow the provisions around capital adequacy.”</p>
<p>Coburn observes that Asian regulators, as well as the region’s financial institutions, have made considerable progress towards implementation of Basel III. Asian banks are well poised to meet its requirements and most regulators in the region have indicated their acceptance of moving towards standard rules on the basis that it will make their institutions more resilient against a financial crisis.</p>
<p>However, he also suggests that it is difficult for regulators to finalise policies when the Basel Committee is still consulting on some of the most important areas, such as the capital floor framework which will affect central issues such as capital ratios and relevant risk-weighted model calculations. “Since the G20 Brisbane Summit, regional regulators have been working together and accepted the need to have an improvement in consistency and comparability in bank capital ratios and an improved approach in calculating internal risk-weighted ratios that have, in the past, have been inconsistently applied.</p>
<p>“In Asia, the banks appear to accept that higher bank capital is inevitable to assist them in improving their resilience to any future financial crisis. The only question remaining is what those ratios will be and the outcomes of the current Basel consultation in relation to capital framework.”</p>
<p>In Australia, the Financial System Inquiry Report (published in December 2014) had already foreshadowed the need for banks to adjust their capital ratios to ensure the financial system is less likely to be dependent on government support in the event of any failure. This report has been accepted as a working benchmark for other governments and regulators in making their markets more efficient and secure.</p>
<h3 id=""remaining-legwork"">Remaining legwork</h3>
<p>According to Coburn, Asian regulators respect the work of the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee – but they also recognise that it may take some time and patience for reforms to be implemented. This does not mean to say that Asian banks don’t feel hard done by. Asian financial institutions have frequently pointed out that having been better capitalised they were not impacted by the global financial crisis – so why should they have to accept the same measures as European and US banks? “Having said that, Singapore always had higher minimum capital requirements than the Basel framework and continues to do so,” adds Matten.</p>
<p>AlixPartners’s Katayama agrees that most Asian banks are in relatively good shape with regard to Basel III requirements. In his view, liquidity requirements are more of a challenge, with holding sufficient liquidity and daily liquidity reporting continuing to be major challenges. Michael Brevetta, Head of US Regulations at PwC, says that on the issue of FATCA compliance, a good deal of work remains to be done. “For example, banks in countries that don’t have inter-governmental agreements in place (such as Vietnam) may have had issues fulfilling reporting requirements.” Financial institutions across Asia are still reviewing pre-existing accounts. “This is a process that could last into 2016.”</p>
<p>Foreign financial institutions (FFIs) in Asia have been advised to review customer activity dating back to mid-2008 and beyond to ascertain whether they may be exposed to the scrutiny of US tax authorities based on information that may already be in the hands of the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or the Department of Justice (DOJ).</p>
<p>An additional complicating factor is that many Asian countries which have reached agreements with the IRS have yet to release guidance for local financial institutions. “International banks are very focused on FATCA and are mostly compliant with the legislation,” says Coburn. “There have not been any violations or investigations that I am aware of that would indicate that regional firms are not complying.”</p>
<h3 id=""knowing-your-procedures"">Knowing your procedures</h3>
<p>On the question of the extent to which ‘Know Your Customer’ (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations are being effectively implemented across Asia, Neill Poole, Executive Director at AlixPartners, says financial institutions are constantly trying to recruit staff for their AML teams and asking for help with training. “This suggests to us that not all companies are ahead of the curve. As in other parts of the world, the region is seeing financial institutions abandoning certain classes of customer on the basis of perceived risk.</p>
<p>“However, this only serves to drive such business into less regulated sectors, which can have a detrimental effect overall on effective implementation of AML regulations.” Poole believes that effective anti-money laundering regulations require a risk-based approach, whereas some financial institutions are applying a rule-based or ‘tick the box’ approach in order to ensure they comply with local regulations.</p>
<p>“This can result in the units responsible for investigation of suspicious transaction reports being overloaded with reports of largely innocent transactions. Until all financial institutions get to the stage where they can single out genuinely suspicious transactions more successfully from the surrounding ‘noise’ of legitimate transactions, implementation of AML regulations will not be truly effective.”</p>
<p>The challenge in applying KYC processes and anti-money laundering rules effectively across Asia is that they are principles-based, adds Matten. “Even if the rules have not changed, the regulators’ interpretation of what they mean in practice can shift significantly, which makes it difficult for institutions to know whether they are compliant.”</p>
<p>According to Coburn, Asian financial institutions and firms have taken compliance with the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws very seriously. “There is also increased emphasis on beneficial ownership. Even countries such as Malaysia are taking a heightened compliance approach given the rise of ISIS funding from the region.</p>
<p>“Asian regulators have introduced enhanced requirements over the past few years and anti-money laundering professionals in the region are also growing more concerned about how regulatory challenges will affect their business.” AML compliance has become more focused in the past five years and regulators are now pressurising financial institutions and firms to make sure they meet best practice standards.</p>

<p>When determining whether Asian regulators have been proactive in terms of implementing Western regulations and/or developing regional regulations, Coburn refers to an opinion that European regulations do not necessarily fit into the financial market structure in Asia; most of the obligations are brought about by the presence of global institutions.</p>
<p>“There is, however, an over-arching acceptance that international best standards are the way forward to ensure that institutions are more resilient and are more able to face another financial crisis. Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia have led the way in ensuring that the financial sector adheres to cross-border regulatory requirements. In some respects, they have a more focused vision of what works in the Asian region than regulators in Europe and America.”</p>
<p>China has indicated that it is striving to meet international best practice in many regulatory areas and Japan has introduced a new corporate governance code for listed companies in line with international best practice. “It is fair to say that Asian regulators are playing an important part in promoting international governance through the Financial Stability Board, the Basel Committee and IOSCO, which will also help enhance regulatory and financial stability in the region,” adds Coburn.</p>
<p>But while Asian regulators have made progress elevating the awareness of the need for more effective compliance among financial institutions, many Asian jurisdictions still lag behind the US and UK, concludes Poole. “If Asian regulators want to drive change and implement a robust culture of compliance among their constituents, they should consider holding individual members of boards of directors responsible and accountable in order to achieve the right ‘tone from the top’.</p>
<p>“Though continual progress is being made, it won’t be clear how deeply rooted these initiatives are within organisations until regulators enforce their policies as vigorously as some of their Western counterparts.”</p>


","Companies and financial institutions across Asia face an increasing challenge in complying with regulations formulated on the other side of the world. Here, we consider the extent to which regulations such as EMIR, Dodd-Frank and FATCA have impacted the region and examine the intended (and unintended) consequences for treasurers and their banking partners.",https://treasurytoday.com:443/-/media/images/regulation-and-standards/regulation-and-compliance/ss-hike-in-bromo-volcano-198732758.jpg,2015-05-01,Regulation Compliance,False

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>Much has been written about the ‘unintended consequences’ of regulation and our Editorial this month looks at the problem of over-regulation. Yet little has been said about the benefits. Can key regulatory reforms really bring anything positive to the treasury environment? On that topic, the response from treasury experts, it seems, is rather mixed.</em></p>
<p>EMIR, Dodd-Frank, SEPA, FATCA, the list goes on. Regulation has been a heavy burden for most treasurers over the last few years; and that’s not even considering the indirect impact of changes in the banking sector. In fact, regulatory compliance is “an increasing overhead, some of which is a tick in the box exercise and, thus, doesn’t add any value.” That was the candid opinion of one respondent to Treasury Today’s 2014 European Corporate Treasury Benchmarking Study – and many other treasurers hold similar views. “I prefer to remain polite and not comment on valueless, EMIR-like constraints,” said another.</p>
<p>Whilst the negative effects of regulation are not in question, it is perhaps pertinent to ask whether corporates are benefitting – either directly or indirectly – from these initiatives.</p>
<h3 id=""emir-as-a-starter-for-ten"">EMIR as a starter for ten</h3>
<p>Designed to standardise over the counter (OTC) derivative markets across EU countries as well as improve transparency and mitigate systematic risk, the mandatory clearing requirements of European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) are, at the time of writing, still being finalised by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). The current draft requires corporates – that are already, or planning to become, central counterparty clearing house (CCP) members – to clear six months from the date when the legislation comes into force.</p>
<p>“Interest rates clearing legislation is expected to be completed first and come into effect in the third or fourth quarter of this year, with credit derivatives to follow,” says Olga Cileckova, Director at PwC. “If corporates are already clearing members or looking for direct access to CCPs, one assumes they are already voluntarily clearing most standardised contracts.”</p>
<p>The current clearing draft legislation also proposes a three year transition period for non-financial counterparties that are currently not clearing members but have OTC derivative activity above the clearing threshold. “While 2018 seems a long way off, there are reasons for corporates subject to clearing to be taking an interest now to assess the clearing options that will be available to them, the cost of clearing access and development of the legislation,” adds Cileckova. “Clearing services are expected to be impacted by the banking regulations, in particular Basel III.”</p>
<p>The corporate community has largely been shielded from the impact of OTC derivatives regulation in Europe thus far – delegated trade reporting is permitted and regulation of non-financial counterparties has been less onerous than for banks, observes Senior Analyst at Aite Group, Virginie O’Shea. Due to the extensive delays and revisions to EMIR, many corporates have held off on preparing for clearing requirements.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge for these firms is a lack of internal expertise on the practice of clearing, she adds. “Banks have been exposed to these requirements and challenges before, but corporates are not financial operations or compliance experts. The numerous problems that regulators have encountered in making sense of trade reporting data have not helped matters – there is general sentiment that reporting infractions will be almost impossible to detect for the next year or so.”</p>
<h3 id=""varying-degrees"">Varying degrees</h3>
<p>The inclusion of a phased approach to EMIR has been helpful, although the rules are still capturing a large number of corporate clients with varying degrees of sophistication says Chris Probert, Managing Principal, Capco. “Traditionally, these clients’ systems and processes have been less automated. Trades which may be seen as straight through processing for a multinational broker dealer could be manual for corporates, which presents them with operational and IT challenges to ensure they can meet their obligations.”</p>
<p>Aside from the technical challenges associated with clearing, there is the considerable administrative task involved in the process, he continues. “Corporates need to decide who will be their clearing broker and backup broker; what (if any) market infrastructure they will use; and how they would like their margin to be segregated, along with a wide range of other decisions. These decisions and the related paperwork take time.”</p>
<p>Probert suggests that the wide range of corporates impacted by clearing rules makes it impossible to label the whole group as either prepared or not. “Undoubtedly the larger, more sophisticated corporates (who may already be clearing) are in the main part ready. The issue is with the smaller corporates who have traditionally have been slow to react to regulatory changes and are likely to be up against the clock to get everything ready in time.”</p>
<p>Deloitte’s Treasury Advisory Service co-leader Karlien Porre, however, points out that while corporates have to comply with reporting and risk mitigation components of EMIR, most are exempt from its clearing requirements since they are classified as non-financial counterparties.</p>
<p>And on the subject of the upside of EMIR for corporates, she notes that “some companies would see compliance as a cost rather than a source of benefit. The real benefit is improved financial market stability.” On a counter note, Jan Vermeer, Partner and Founder of Treasury Services describes EMIR (and Basel III) as having contributed to higher banking costs for corporates who are determining their bank relationships based on a RAROC or risk adjusted return on capital model.</p>
<h3 id=""basel-iii-the-knock-on-effect"">Basel III: the knock-on effect</h3>
<p>One of the most significant but least-discussed regulatory changes that will impact corporate users of treasury management services is Basel III, explains Daniel Blumen, Partner at Treasury Alliance Group: “There is a direct connection between balance sheet changes the banks are making and the cost and availability of treasury services. Most corporates don’t know their banks’ position and so cannot act to take advantage of the changes or mitigate their impact,” he explains.</p>
<p>Furthermore, “while Basel III has prompted changes in banking services, particularly driven by the liquidity rules, the expectation of many corporates is that there will be more changes to come around treasury services, credit/liquidity facilities and ‘non-operational’ deposits,” says Robert Ceske, Principal and Head of KPMG’s US treasury practice.</p>
<p>One of the problems is that the banks are not yet talking to their clients, which keeps the issue off the radar of many corporates, Ceske suggests. “There will be significant shifts in business allocation and restructured credit facilities by corporates as the impact becomes clearer. The smarter ones are taking action now but this issue will be at the top of treasury discussions later this year.”</p>
<p>In some cases, Basel III has led to credit lines being tied up and banks asking clients to deposit for a period longer than three months, explains Cileckova, while in other areas – such as pricing of high frequency, low volume derivatives – the impact is less transparent. According to Enrico Camerinelli, also a Senior Analyst at Aite, the regulation has made users of corporate banking services more knowledgeable on how their bank partners are handling the compliance requirements. “Bank relationship management is becoming a must-have practice to assess whether banks have charged/are charging costs of compliance to corporate clients.”</p>
<p>Banks are still working on Basel III implementation and there has been little price impact on corporates due to competitive financial markets – that is the view of Dino Nicolaides, Deloitte Treasury Advisory Services co-leader. “There has been limited impact on lending, although we have seen more UK and European corporates accessing capital markets directly for funding as opposed to the loan market, which is a shift towards the US model. Some argue that the financial crisis and Basel III have accelerated this process.”</p>
<p>Another possible implication for corporates is that banks may decide either that they no longer want their business because they are either over-exposed to the company or that the mix of business done with the company has to change. “In the past, the bank would only have to consider counterparty risk,” explains Jerry Norton, Vice President Financial Services at CGI. “Now it has to look at the liquidity coverage ratio and the leverage ratio and understand the impact of corporate activity across its book. In some cases this might mean the bank will favour business from a specific industry sector or drop certain types of business.”</p>
<p>It’s not all bad news though. Neil Vernon, CTO Gresham Computing believes the opportunity to reduce their capital adequacy requirements has encouraged banks to take a closer look at how they can better serve their customers’ needs and that they are delivering better service and more innovative products as a result.</p>




<h3 id=""the-lowdown-on-money-market-funds"">The lowdown on money market funds</h3>
<p>In addition to pending clarity of EMIR and increased discussion of Basel III, corporates had been waiting for further clarity on the changes to European money market funds (MMFs) regulation – which was announced in March. See our article focusing more in-depth on the implications of new European MMF regulation on page 24 of this issue.</p>



<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h3 id=""ring-fencing-in-the-uk"">Ring-fencing in the UK</h3>
<p>Of specific regulatory consideration for UK corporates is the Bank of England Prudential Regulation Authority’s (PRA) implementation of ring-fencing of core UK financial services and activities for banking groups with core deposits in excess of £25bn. The government has stated its intention for ring-fencing to take effect from the 1<sup>st</sup> January 2019. The PRA has acknowledged that this is of interest to customers of the affected banks and intends to undertake further consultations during 2015 and publish final rules and supervisory statements in 2016 to provide firms with sufficient time for implementation.</p>
<p>“There are concerns among corporates that they might have to change sort codes and other account details if their business was moved into the part of their bank that is not ring-fenced,” explains Norton. Elsewhere, some smaller companies will find themselves dealing with the ring-fenced bank (RFB), yet the derivatives offered by the RFB will be limited and will not necessarily cover all their hedging needs.</p>
<h3 id=""sepa-trundles-on"">SEPA trundles on</h3>
<p>Finally, SEPA continues to be a headache for many corporates. Not least because all the hard work does not seem to be paying off yet, especially for the smaller players. “Some of the larger, pan-European companies have also yet to reap the returns on their considerable investments, although improvements in terms of process standardisation and lower banking costs are starting to filter through,” confirms Norton. He says these improvements are being felt most keenly by corporations with significant business-to-consumer operations, including utilities, mobile operators and insurance companies.</p>
<p>But opinions about SEPA improvements – and limitations – going forward are somewhat split. Magnus Carlsson, Manager of Treasury &amp; Payments at the Association for Financial Professionals, focuses on one of the practical limitations of SEPA, namely the size restriction for a payment to only 140 characters. “This means that instead of sending payments for multiple invoices in one transaction, corporates have to use one transaction per invoice. So even if the cost per invoice was considerably lower, the overall cost for sending payments could very well be greater than with the legacy system.”</p>
<p>However, KPMG’s Finance &amp; Treasury Management Partner in Germany, Carsten Jaekel, takes a more positive view and suggests that many corporate customers now have a better understanding of the benefit of single formats. For him, the Common Global Implementation initiative will build on the foundation laid by SEPA and eventually lead to significant savings from fully-fledged payment and collection factories. According to Cileckova, SEPA has made the euro payment system more efficient overall – leading to savings in transaction costs – and that many companies are now focusing on the second round of SEPA optimisation when the new Payments Services Directive becomes a pressing implementation issue.</p>
<p>Benefits of SEPA for corporates include: a wider portfolio of banks to process their payments business, increased pricing competition, cost benefits from optimised and standardised enterprise resource planning (ERP) bank interfaces using the ISO 20022 standard for payments and account information services. SEPA is also improving straight through reconciliation capabilities by enriched data carried in the messages and has introduced the direct debit payments instrument in order to collect funds centrally across all countries and customer accounts.</p>
<p>“However, as a result of the financial crisis, many corporates have become very risk conscious and reluctant to consolidate their payments business with a single bank and location within Europe, so this obvious benefit has rarely been implemented,” suggests Capco Partner Bernd Richter. Camerinelli also acknowledges that although use of the ISO 20022 standard allows for the alignment of payments transactions in all SEPA countries, it is yet to be fully exploited.</p>


<blockquote>There are concerns among corporates that they might have to change sort codes and other account details if their business was moved into the part of their bank that is not ring-fenced.</blockquote>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Elsewhere in SEPA-land, in December 2014, the Euro Retail Payments Board (ERPB) decided to step up work on instant payments, person-to-person mobile payments and contactless payments as well as issuing a set of recommendations to address outstanding issues in the SEPA credit transfer and direct debit schemes, such as the move to IBAN only and the harmonisation of payment standards between banks and customers.</p>
<p>The ERPB is concerned that the emergence of new solutions might end up creating a fragmented market in Europe for instant payments. “Solutions for instant payments should avoid the ‘silo’ mentality of closed systems that don’t communicate with each other and take advantage of the harmonisation and integration already achieved with the SEPA project,” says Yves Mersch, member of the ECB’s executive board and chair of the ERPB.</p>
<h3 id=""always-look-on-the-bright-side"">Always look on the bright side</h3>
<p>In the midst of the headache that regulation can be, and with so many conflicting opinions to take on board, it is often difficult to see the silver lining. But as Mersch alludes to, taking advantage of regulatory benefits, or at least opportunities, is something all corporates must strive to do. And although the regulatory burden is not likely to lighten in the near future, in some areas at least, corporates can look forward to their hard work delivering worthwhile rewards.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>When the quantity of goods produced rises, the fixed costs per unit will fall; this is the basic theory of economies of scale. It can apply to the manufacture of parts in an automotive factory equally as well as it can apply to certain basic processes executed by a corporate shared service centre: do more of it in one place and it will cost you less.</p>
<p>When it comes to the core – but vital – payments and collections functions, the last five years or so have seen the rise of ‘on behalf of’ (OBO) processing. As regional and even global treasury or shared service centres have gained in popularity, so payments on behalf of (POBO) and collections on behalf of (COBO) have risen up the ‘to do’ list of many a multinational corporate looking for cost and process efficiencies across multiple entities and where multiple currencies have necessitated the use of many different banks and bank accounts. The elimination of redundant processes and the sharing of facilities is often seen as a sensible move.</p>
<p>A POBO/COBO operation is essentially a single point of payment or collection, each set up as a separate entity, administered from a commercially convenient location for the benefit of other entities within a group of companies. It allows corporates to consolidate bank accounts and transactions across the enterprise by using a standard payments process and streamlined bank account structure. Instead of each entity owning and operating its own external bank accounts (and maybe participating in a pooling structure) there is a single legal entity that sits at the heart of the company, supported by an in-house bank (IHB), that manages collections and all payments on behalf of participating entities.</p>
<p>With the centralisation of treasury gaining ground since the onset of the 2008 crisis, models of cash management that offer visibility and control over company cash have become much favoured. Anecdotal evidence suggests that corporates in the ME have been using POBO-type structures since the early 1990s and it is understood that almost all large, multidivisional conglomerates in the region today use a POBO model.</p>
<p>In Europe, it was regulatory change that finally threw open the doors of opportunity around Accounts Payable (AP) with SEPA. A significant benefit derived from the roll-out of the Eurozone payments mechanism is the reduction of banking costs. In creating a standardised payments environment large corporate groups have been able to rationalise their multiple bank accounts and payments formats potentially down to just one for the entire zone. Increased automation of payments processes has become a very real prospect under SEPA too, especially with the homogenisation of electronic direct debits and credit transfers facilitated by the across-the-board adoption of ISO 20022/XML payments standards.</p>
<p>In Asia Pacific too there is movement in the direction of POBO/COBO with Deutsche Bank, for example, launching its comprehensive ‘Payments and Collections On Behalf Of’ programme for regional clients in 2013 (see its ‘Corporate User Guide – POBO/COBO’ for a detailed look at the topic).</p>
<h3 id=""progression"">Progression</h3>
<p>The expansion of payments and collections management processes into POBO/COBO by treasuries tends to follow a common path. Collections and payments commonly start with local execution by subsidiaries. From here, regional centres of liquidity may evolve to include shared service centres (SSCs) for basic functions that reach across an enterprise. An in-house banking structure may extend the centralisation programme, replacing most or all external bank accounts for subsidiaries with one in-house operation.</p>

<p class=""quote-block__source""></p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>With the technical and operational structure of an IHB in place the next logical move is to establish a regional payment factory. With a change in the internal bank account structure, a POBO/COBO operation may be deployed to pay/collect using a single bank account per currency or country for all participating group entities.</p>
<p>Whilst there is a common path, there is no one route. Each transformation programme should be planned on its own merits, constraints and objectives.</p>
<h3 id=""basic-requirements-and-set-up"">Basic requirements and set-up</h3>
<p>Before embarking on a COBO/POBO project a number of elements must (or in some cases should) be in place to ensure the best outcome. Deutsche Bank recommends the following: central treasury and all entities to be included must be on the same IT systems, including accounting and ERP.</p>
<p>Whilst it is ideal to have central treasury and all participating entities on the same IT systems, it is often not achievable or practical. What is more important is to ensure that all the centralised payments and reconciliations processes are standardised and controlled by one process owner.</p>
<p>Provider agreements must be in place between payments and collections factories and the participating entities. An SSC, IHB or payment factory setup will usually see to it that these are met.</p>
<p>The starting point of a POBO operation will usually be a payments factory (the latter typically using a common IT platform to consolidate SSC processes) which manages a centralised standard payments process for participant entities. With the technical infrastructure and processes in place, a single legal entity will be established to pay the third-party debt obligations of another legal entity in the group. The process requires the exchange of external bank accounts owned by the group entities for IHB accounts (owned by the payment factory) per country and/or currency.</p>
<p>COBO has a similar structure, requiring entities to substitute external accounts for IHB accounts. In this set-up, a central collections factory initiates a claim on behalf of a group entity for payment from a third party. The third party will make the payment into the relevant central account for the currency/country. This account may also be a source account for the group’s sweeping/pooling structure. Reconciliation of paid invoices and ultimate fund ownership will be managed and assigned within the internal accounting process (hence the need to have IT alignment).</p>
<p>Technology supports the entire OBO concept. Having a centralised treasury and an IHB in place facilitates consideration of POBO or COBO implementation simply because the technical infrastructure will already be in place, underpinned by a single instance of an ERP. One of the major set-up issues for COBO is the fact that the majority of receivables data is held locally; where the single bank account is used for collections, if reconciliation is managed locally, determination of which payments belong to which entity will be difficult.</p>
<p>One of the main considerations for COBO then is reconciliation of paid invoices. Improving STP rates for cash application relies heavily on the payer attaching all the required invoice data (often they do not). The centralisation of this process and the receipt of paid invoices into a single COBO bank account will enable more effective control and improvement on the quality of information received and the effectiveness of the matching process. This is often supported by optical character recognition (OCR), learning matching algorithms and dedicated workflow. Not least of the issues here is that slow reconciliation can tie up client credit lines and restrict sales. Bank-provided tools such as electronic virtual accounts (in which every client has its own unique identifier number attached to the single main corporate account, the identifier keeping all transactions with this number virtually separated from all others) can provide much-needed assistance: Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citi and Deutsche Bank, for example, all offer variations on this theme.</p>
<h3 id=""plus-points"">Plus points</h3>
<p>By its very nature, a COBO/POBO structure will reduce complexity in terms of managing points of contact with group entities, simplifying banking relationships and infrastructure maintenance.</p>
<p>Replacing multiple external bank accounts with a single internal account (per currency/country) equates to potential cost savings on bank fees, especially around account maintenance, transaction fees and foreign exchange (the latter simply by reducing the number of required transactions). This can be driven by control of process execution as much as scale. Other business drivers to evaluate would include the rationalisation of pooling structures and potential for increasing net interest enhancement.</p>
<p>The convenience of POBO/COBO typically also means lower running costs in terms of personnel and overheads. Savings will be made by consolidating local IT systems and software licensing into a single platform. IT and process consolidation should also lead to standardisation of these elements. Focusing banking and IT elements on fewer providers could positively change the dynamic of the relationship with the chosen third parties; an increase in wallet share for those providers could increase buyer-power.</p>


<blockquote>With the technical and operational structure of an IHB in place the next logical move is to establish a regional payment factory. With a change in the internal bank account structure, a POBO/COBO operation may be deployed to pay/collect using a single bank account per currency or country for all participating group entities.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source""></p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Because incoming and outgoing company cash can to a large degree be centralised, POBO/COBO will also typically be expected to deliver improvements in visibility of that cash, in turn affording distinct advantages around areas such as working capital management, forecasting and risk management. In the case of COBO, payments from third parties may be expedited with more efficiency and collections may be reconciled sooner.</p>
<p>An efficient POBO/COBO operation should enable local operations to focus more on adding value rather than tackling time-consuming core functions. Although set-up costs are inevitable and are likely to be significant (<a href=""#cost-of-change"">these are discussed in the costs section</a>), the ongoing costs of processing payments and collections through a single entity should reduce, simply based on economies of scale.</p>
<h3 id=""who-needs-to-know"">Who needs to know?</h3>
<p>From the outset, tax, legal and compliance teams must be consulted; the initial investigation/proof of concept will certainly call upon their expertise and knowledge to reveal any potential pitfalls. Obviously the individual group entities will need to be brought into the discussion not least because some local entities may resist the move to COBO, particularly sales offices which may resent losing control over receivables activity and the direct relationship with (and knowledge of) their own clients. Indeed, local entity clients must also be informed of a move to an OBO model. Client conversations might, for example, throw up concerns and issues around the adjustment of direct debit mandates and any stipulations in trade contracts or local legal matters that may hinder or even prohibit movement from local to central payments and collections.</p>
<h3 id=""legal-warnings"">Legal warnings</h3>
<p>The movement of financial management from one country to another brings with it a number of potential legal and taxation issues which must first be investigated for each proposed entity; not all may be permitted to join whilst others may be required to meet certain conditions before acceptance (or it may prove too difficult to warrant inclusion).</p>
<p>It will be necessary to establish whether the entities proposed for participation are, by local law, even permitted to take part in a COBO structure – what central bank approval and reporting requirements may arise as a result of participation where they are allowed, and if there are any restrictions on types of payments made by the centre.</p>


<blockquote>Undertaking a significant change to one of the most fundamental aspects of a business’ operating model will almost certainly come with a price tag.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source""></p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Where client data is shared across borders, provision for data protection will need to be investigated in every jurisdiction. Other regulatory issues may arise, not least the possible requirement for a banking licence; although in most European countries this is not necessary, in the Americas it may well be a requirement (for example, Argentina and Brazil require a licence and in Canada one is required for a central collections operation).</p>
<p>At an individual local entity level, where other bank accounts are retained, treasury will need to establish if the OBO structure infringes any individual banking covenants that may exist for those relationships (such as the removal of all or most funds to a central location).</p>
<h3 id=""tax-considerations"">Tax considerations</h3>
<p>Taxation is never far from view. Conversion to an OBO model using an IHB effectively creates an inter-company position which requires the preparation of a combined or consolidated financial statement for tax and reporting purposes.</p>
<p>Corporates must investigate whether withholding tax and thin capitalisation rules are applicable for a proposed OBO operation. Issues around transfer-pricing, Controlled Foreign Companies legislation (designed to stop companies from reducing tax in one jurisdiction by diverting profits to tax shelters and ‘preferential’ regimes), VAT and stamp duty may also impact the feasibility of an operation or the entities it covers.</p>
<p>Whereas the underlying bank account for POBO is normally viewed as an ordinary operating account, a COBO account is in most jurisdictions considered to be a trust account for tax purposes. Where these are established, their operation, documentation and reporting must be considered in the light of local tax law. Such accounts may have some downstream impact on existing liquidity and credit matters; the corporate’s cash management banks should be consulted to see what, if anything, this means.</p>
<p>There may be detrimental tax treatments of inter-company lending applied to OBO structures – all Asian and American markets require a close look at this, and around half of all European jurisdictions require detailed review in this respect too.</p>
<h3 id=""cost-of-change"">Cost of change</h3>
<p>Undertaking a significant change to one of the most fundamental aspects of a business’ operating model will almost certainly come with a price tag. Prior to implementation it will be necessary to undertake feasibility studies around tax, legal, regulatory and market matters (including banking, vendor, customer and supplier relationships) for the proposed location of the POBO/COBO site and how these elements may impact each entity targeted to join the structure. These elements require continual reassessment due to their constantly evolving nature – the level of understanding needed represents a significant outlay.</p>
<p>Perhaps the main cost for corporates seeking the advantages of OBO, as recognised by Deutsche Bank’s white paper, will be technological: implementing and managing IT interfaces, workflows, system configurations, internal and external reporting and reconciliation processes.</p>
<p>In terms of business case, direct costs can be heavily influenced by the cost of IT implementation and integration but other costs, both direct and indirect, should not be underestimated. These can include considerations of the impact on people, organisational structure and the cost of running the programme.</p>
<p>Careful consideration should be given to the implementation approach to control cost and manage implementation risk. All centralised operations will be judged by their ability to execute flawlessly – there is normally no ‘honeymoon’ period in an ‘on behalf of’ model.</p>
<h3 id=""is-migration-an-option"">Is migration an option?</h3>
<p>The decision by a large corporate to migrate to an OBO operation is far from obvious. The set-up process requires considerable effort, not least with the legal, tax and regulatory investigations that must take place in advance of that decision and thereafter to keep pace of any developments – for each and every country involved. The need to develop and maintain the IT infrastructure, enabling continued connectivity between the relevant entities and the IHB/OBO facility, is essential. Process automation (including reconciliation) requires standardisation as far as possible if bottlenecks are to be avoided and any resistance by local teams to let go of their client relationships must be tackled sensitively.</p>
<p>However, once in place, an OBO structure can deliver a number of benefits for corporates including bank account consolidation, lower account, transaction and FX fees, re-focus by local entities on value-added work, lower longer-term IT costs and, perhaps the leading driver, improved visibility over working capital. Economies of scale can, and indeed do work – but not before a lot of hard graft has been put in to prepare the ground.</p>


","If basic processes of payments and collections are centralised, the cost of those processes decreases; it is a simple economy of scale.

<p><em>Since it first arrived some 30 years ago, corporates have been able to use the concept of netting to drive efficiencies and make cost savings. Treasury Today goes ‘back to basics’ and looks at the processes involved in netting and what it really means for treasurers.</em></p>
<p>There are surely few international corporate treasurers, if any, who would not wish to reduce the cost of financial transactions across their organisation. Fewer still would reject greater control and oversight of their cash positions. Whether it is to better understand or mitigate FX, liquidity or interest rate risk, to optimise cash flow and working capital, or simply to reduce the complexity of inter-company payments within a widely distributed group, there is little doubt that implementing a modern netting structure is an answer to many treasurers’ prayers. But if it is so good, why doesn’t everyone do it?</p>
<p>In the early 1980s, netting was a simple but labour-intensive paper-based operation. Today, the many variants can be managed electronically using largely automated in-house or proprietary web-based technologies capable of reaching out to and effectively centralising the cash operations of even the furthest flung subsidiaries.</p>
<p>In its simplest form, netting allows an organisation to offset one cash amount against another, reduce the number of payments that need to be made and aggregate the remainder. This may be between two entities within the same group of companies (bilateral netting) or involve many entities (multilateral netting). For multilateral netting, transactions will be executed by a netting centre – a central function established for this purpose – and will take place via the external banking system or internally.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of a netting programme increases the more it is used across a group of companies, however, circumstances may preclude certain entities. In some countries central bank regulation may either restrict the use of netting, impose an onerous reporting regime on all activities or not permit it all. The reach of technology may also self-select those business units able to participate, although access to web-based systems, such as those offered by the tier one banks, will obviously improve access, as will a more standardised internal technology environment.</p>
<p>There are two basic netting options:</p>
<h3 id=""bilateral-netting"">Bilateral netting</h3>
<p>One entity may agree to net its payments with another group entity for trade over a set cycle (typically monthly). At the end of the period, the entity that on a net level is in deficit makes a single payment to the other party. This reduces the number of payments being made and received between various pairings of entities across the group. No netting centre is involved and payments still need to be made via the external banking system where fess will be charged. For a larger group of companies a more efficient (multilateral) model exists.</p>
<h3 id=""multilateral-netting"">Multilateral netting</h3>
<p>Multilateral netting, as the name suggests, is a many-to-many scenario where multiple parties may net off their transactions. A single netting centre is required to act as the counterparty to each participating member of the group (usually subsidiaries of the same company but in some cases third-party providers are granted access). Each participant needs to hold an account with the netting centre and payments are only made within the system to or by the netting centre.</p>
<h3 id=""what-happens-during-the-netting-process"">What happens during the netting process?</h3>
<p>Participants in the netting system must forward copies of all relevant documentation, invoices and payment requests to the netting centre, usually electronically and more often now by direct entry into a netting system. A cut-off date for submissions will be in place for each cycle.</p>


<blockquote>The effectiveness of a netting programme increases the more it is used across a group of companies, however, circumstances may preclude certain entities.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source""></p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>All invoices and payments requests are reconciled and when the netting process is run (normally once a month), unmatched items can be investigated. In some systems, subsidiaries may be able to query data input by other entities within the group to fix the problem without further input from other teams. All matched transactions (credits and debits) will be netted to a single amount for each subsidiary in its chosen operating currency, initiating payments either to its own bank or to the in-house bank, as appropriate. Subsidiaries with negative balances at the netting centre will have to make the payment to the centre. FX rates for all disbursements are typically set by the netting centre (and thus do not include the spreads likely to be included by banks).</p>
<h3 id=""who-takes-part"">Who takes part?</h3>
<p>Within a group of companies there will need to be a decision as to which entities can or must participate in the netting centre. Most netting schemes are only open to companies with the same parent. However, in some cases, it may be possible to include non-group (third party) companies where both sales and purchases are made. External participants will need to have sufficient cash flows to be able to benefit group participants but the external entity may be able to net payments to different internal entities within the netting system. Where a third-party supplier receives payments from a number of group entities in multiple countries it may be beneficial to include them, to aggregate payments and reduce the number of cross-border transactions made.</p>

<p>Some commercial sectors have benefitted from the establishment of an industry-wide netting system. Perhaps the most visible is the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Clearing House. It clears and settles accounts payable and receivable (including ticketing and airport fees) for around 500 airlines, airline-associated companies and travel companies across the world.</p>

<h3 id=""single-versus-multi-currency"">Single versus multi-currency</h3>
<p>For payments, the simplest structural form is a <strong>domestic netting</strong> system, also sometimes known as single currency netting. This would normally be open to all group entities within a specific country and cover purely domestic currency payments although it could in principle also include euro-denominated participants. Domestic currency netting systems eliminate the need for the different group entities to make numerous intra-group payments, saving on fees.</p>
<p>In <strong>multi-currency netting</strong>, all the participants in the system are required to send payment instructions and copy invoices, regardless of currency, to the netting centre. The netting centre converts any foreign currency payments into the appropriate netting currency. At the end of the netting cycle, the netting centre makes payments to or receives payments from each participant. These payments will be made through the external banking system and will usually be denominated in the operating currencies of the participants.</p>
<p>As with the domestic currency netting systems, multilateral netting removes the need for multiple intra-group payments. Every netting cycle requires participants to make (or receive) payments only in its operating currency. For entities that had previously made large numbers of foreign currency payments, netting can lead to significant savings in this respect.</p>
<h3 id=""the-benefits-of-netting"">The benefits of netting</h3>
<p>Where a multilateral netting programme is in place, the benefits are many. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Reduced payment costs and interest payments.</strong>
<p>As all external payments are netted, there is only one external payment into or out of each subsidiary, which significantly reduces the total cost of these payments to the group as a whole. Individual business units will not need to operate overdrafts or maintain idle balances to meet their short-term payment requirements. In addition, the total amount of FX purchased and sold will be lower, reducing the amount of FX commission, and a lower number of foreign currency accounts will need to be managed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Reduced float.</strong>
<p>Delays between an initial payment instruction and the receipt of the final payment are reduced. With fewer external foreign exchange deals, cash can be made to work more efficiently during the netting cycle because idle balances and float should only exist at the end of each cycle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Known payment date.</strong>
<p>Each subsidiary in the netting centre knows when it is going to get paid for any inter-company invoices it has issued. Subsidiaries may have to pay their invoices earlier, but they know exactly which day they will receive cash on the invoices that they are expecting. This brings stability to the timing of cash flows – and improved forecasting – within the organisation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Banking consolidation.</strong>
<p>The concentration of payments and receipts means treasury can choose to have one bank or at least consolidate the number of banking partners its does its FX with. Treasurers thus can reduce the number of banks that they are exposed to from a settlement perspective. Savings are also available on the FX spread because the greater the size of transactions made, the greater the potential for cost savings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Simplification for subsidiaries.</strong>
<p>They no longer have to decide which currencies they need to buy, instead paying and receiving in a single currency. This means local treasury functions can focus on adding value elsewhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Reduced operational risk.</strong>
<p>This comes as a benefit of no longer relying on manual and de-centralised payment and settlement processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Hedging efficiencies.</strong>
<p>A netting cycle mean treasurers know the specific date that they are exposed to FX risk, allowing them to hedge efficiently and effectively as it reduces timing gaps in their hedging programme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Payment discipline is improved.</strong>
<p>Trade terms can be shortened between partners if cash flows are predictable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Arbitration service.</strong>
<p>The netting centre effectively takes on the role of neutral dispute manager.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Early warning of exceptions.</strong>
<p>Payment matching will be automated as invoices are sent to the netting centre. If an invoice is not matched, advance notice of a potential problem can be issued and the problem rectified before too much time is wasted identifying the source of error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Cash management information is improved.</strong>
<p>Because intra-group payments are recorded at the netting centre the information can be used to generate various reports including, for example, management information looking at the fees and spread savings achieved, and regulatory information required by certain jurisdictions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=""the-cost-of-netting-technology-and-models"">The cost of netting: technology and models</h3>
<p>The costs of a netting structure will vary according to what is required but in the first instance there will be a need to persuade all entities to get on board with the programme and any resistance to change must be managed sensitively to encourage rather than demand buy-in. Almost certainly training resources will be required to ensure that all relevant subsidiaries are up to speed with the processes that underpin the netting system once it is in operation.</p>
<p>There will be an implementation cost to consider. Existing technologies and processes across the group will need to be standardised as far as possible. This may not be easy in difficult geographies where communications are less reliable, in which case other means of data transfer may need to be found (even if it means email). Initial software purchase or an upgrade or extension of an existing system (such as a TMS, ERP or dedicated third-party netting software) must be factored in as must ongoing licensing and maintenance costs. Consideration must be given in each case to the ease of implementation and roll-out of the solution, including the ease with which the solution integrates with existing technologies. The functionality and scalability of the system and any likely costs in configuring it to fit the company’s own needs should also be taken into account. It may be necessary to adopt a phased, rather than big bang-style roll-out to make the project more manageable.</p>
<p>There will be a cost associated with running a netting centre although some of the administrative work previously performed by group entities will be diverted here, with subsidiary staff preferably diverted to other added-value work.</p>
<p>The cost of any additional accounting and legal matters related to the netting centre will have to be taken into consideration. Complexity and cost will depend on location but taxation on inter-company payments and, for cross-border netting, any central bank requirements, must be met head-on. There will also be a requirement for the accounting functions of participating entities to work out how to treat the various transactions. Within the cash receipts and accounts payable books it may, for instance, be necessary to divide netted transactions into respective individual payments and receipts.</p>
<p>Outsourcing of a netting operation is an option offered by some banks and treasury service providers. There will be costs associated with establishing and running of a netting service and it may be more provident to outsource the running of the netting system. A cross-over of duties may be possible, where a corporate is able to take on the netting task but is comfortable handing over FX settlement, for example, to its banking partner. However, the nature of netting means full outsourcing is not possible: around 20% of the workload inevitably stays in-house in the form of confirming and sending payment requests plus of course the aforementioned essential accounting and tax treatments and documentation of flows for audit purposes.</p>
<h3 id=""moving-ahead"">Moving ahead</h3>
<p>Adoption of netting amongst the corporate community is far from across the board. This may be because there are a number of variables that need to be tackled, not least being the regulatory hurdle in some jurisdictions and, closer to home, the lack of standardisation of technology internally. These issues are not insurmountable. For a process that has been developing slowly over the past 30 years or so, netting remains a simple yet effective proposition where the benefits are clear, particularly for MNCs that have a high volume of inter-company invoicing and cross-border, cross-currency transactions.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><i>For any business, knowing how much money will be coming in and going out gives a better understanding of how much will be needed to keep operating and to enable growth. The optimisation and most effective use of cash, in essence, is what cash flow forecasting is all about.</i></p>
<p>Whilst the fundamental principles and purposes of cash flow forecasting remain largely unchanged, the needs of the modern market have placed greater emphasis on accuracy and cash visibility. The full 100% minimum liquidity coverage ratio of Basel III (to be enforced in 2015) will change the liquidity landscape as banks – including Asian banks – place different values on the deposits sitting on their balance sheets. As corporates revisit their investment policies and risk appetites in this environment, and as structures such as in-house banks, payments-on-behalf of, collections-on-behalf of and payments factories continue to emerge as favoured models, visibility over cash becomes ever more vital. The aim is to be able to segment that cash into the most appropriate operational, reserve and strategic liquidity pools and, particularly in Asia, be able to navigate the regulatory diversity that characterises regional markets.</p>
<p>In achieving this goal, one of the key requirements now is for treasurers to better understand the needs of their business colleagues, and for those colleagues in other business functions to understand the needs of treasury and the function of liquidity. Even corporates that, by the nature of their business or sector, have not been best placed to deliver accurate forecasts should now be looking for a clearer all-round view. For an organisation, being sufficiently agile to get the best from its financial data is important; technology can play a part, but open communication is essential.</p>
<h3 id=""clear-communication"">Clear communication</h3>
<p>The treasurer is typically charged with looking after the organisation’s cash, ensuring it has appropriate liquidity and mitigating any risks and changes in business flow that may arise. But often the information related to these tasks resides in other business units and all too often these functions sit in siloes and communication is minimal. The calls from treasury for yet more financial data may not always be seen in a positive light if there is little understanding of why it is needed. This really becomes a problem when the other functions fail to recognise that the information they provide has to be current and accurate; rough approximations will lead to inaccurate forecasts and a subsequent incorrect assessment of cash needs by treasury. This is a major risk for the entire company.</p>
<p>If business units are held accountable for the determination of their own cash and liquidity needs and feeding that back into the cash flow forecasting process, it will encourage understanding. It will be beneficial, in terms of the accountability of the business units, for those units to be measured and monitored using KPIs to ensure that the task is carried out in a timely and accurate fashion. It will also be helpful for the treasurer to clearly explain to the business unit heads that the information provided will be used not just for liquidity planning but also possibly for interest rate planning and FX hedging, and that getting it significantly wrong is a serious risk event. Indeed, if the forecast is significantly wrong because the information provided was inaccurate or because the modelling was poor, the treasurer may be hedging a position that does not exist, exposing the business to trading and open positions that are not backed up by real business flows. Sizeable and unexpected losses may ensue.</p>

<h2 id=""case-study"">Case study</h2>
<h3>Cash flow forecasting in practice: TRILUX Group</h3>
<p>International lighting solutions provider, TRILUX Group, has more than 20 production and sales sites in Europe and Asia (including China, Hong Kong, Philippines and India). Its Group Management division operates a multi-layer five-year integrated budget and liquidity forecasting plan which includes an annual view of the Group’s P&amp;L, balance sheet and cash flow across all business units, covering some ten currencies in total. This, explains Oliver Thissen, Member of the Management Board, Finance/Legal, enables Group Management to draw up the budget and liquidity plans for the following financial year, which it does every September, the figures being based on refinement at multiple points in the year with reference to actuals.</p>
<p>To enable this, Thissen explains that the Group has a cash forecast and cash management plan running on a daily basis, using information generated by the import of SWIFT MT940s into its single SAP treasury management system (up to 90% of bank statement data from more than 150 accounts is loaded automatically, says Thissen). Each business unit is required to create a rolling four-month liquidity plan which is revised using actuals on a weekly basis. On a monthly basis the annual budget and liquidity plans can then be revised for each company within the Group. A comparison is made between monthly target and actual account statements with explanations sought for any variance. The revised results are fed back into the annual budget and liquidity plans as part of the continuing cycle of updating and improving.</p>
<p>The rolling data is in fact a series of five liquidity planning spreadsheets, notes Thissen. These cover the following data points: an overview of liquidity allocation; assumptions of tax (including VAT) and personnel expenses (such as social security payments); an estimation of financial status (external loans and deposits and those managed via TRILUX’s in-house bank) and a consideration of payment terms (such as the posting of sales revenue versus customer payment data); estimated and actual opening balances (each business unit has the opportunity to enter and explain any manual adjustments). The fifth spreadsheet is the output of all companies, uploaded into the TMS and consolidated into one view which is used to produce annual budget and liquidity forecasting plans.</p>
<p>Collection of figures starts with actual budget figures from the previous month, output from SAP; the rolling budget forecasts for the next month are then added. Using what Thissen refers to as an “Excel bridge”, data is transferred into the rolling forecast for cash flow. The entire process to this stage is carried out on a per company basis so the results uploaded into the TMS generate around 35 different cash flow forecasts within the system. With the help of TMS he explains that it is then possible then to consolidate all forecasts into a single view. This view is used to produce annual budget and liquidity forecasting plans – and the cycle continues.</p>

<h3 id=""timing"">Timing</h3>
<p>The frequency of forecasting depends on industry sector and, to an extent, the size of the business. A treasurer will often run a forecast off the back of a cash positioning process, used to determine elements such as current available balances, cash concentration and funding. The period depends on need: short-term cash forecasting is for overnights and investments into the market, whereas the longer forecast ensures cash is in the right place at the right time and in the right currency.</p>
<p>As with any process of prediction, the further out you go, accuracy will diminish. This is why frequent updates using actuals is essential and why known future financial events, such as debt repayments, must be incorporated. In considering the latter, it should be apparent that forecasting not only recognises cash events over a certain time horizon but also non-cash events such as repayments, covenants, interest rate and FX risk exposures and even hedging policies.</p>
<h3 id=""accuracy"">Accuracy</h3>
<p>Good quality information and a means of managing accuracy are vital elements of forecasting. This can be achieved with a ‘look-back’ process – sometimes known as variance analysis – to analyse and update previous forecasts using actual figures.</p>
<p>Attaining 100% accuracy in a forecast is unlikely, especially for the longer-term view. In fact, the Treasury Today 2014 Asia Pacific Corporate Treasury Benchmarking Study reveals that just 8% of treasurers in the region reach an accuracy level of more than 90% when comparing forecast versus actuals on volume of transactions; it slips to just 5% when comparing for value of transactions.</p>
<p>However, it is important to understand cause and effect to eke out incremental improvements in the managing, monitoring and provision of data. If it is understood why something happened it may be possible to prevent or replicate that scenario as required. The more the treasurer is in charge of what flows are going to look like, the better the forecast will be.</p>
<h3 id=""methods-and-models"">Methods and models</h3>
<p>When generating a forecast, it is important to have access to an historical database of actuals that show how the business needs and uses cash over time. But data is just data until it is cross-referenced and interpreted; only then does it become usable information. By bringing it all together, it is possible to apply relatively simple statistical analysis to produce a forecast (it is also possible to apply highly complex mathematical models, explanations of which can be found elsewhere). Obviously it is important to consider whether the business has changed in any significant way (a major change of sales model or product line, for example) before using previous forecasts and actuals to influence results, but by looking at the database of cash actuals relative to projections, any variance will be apparent.</p>
<p>There are two basic types of variance analysis: ‘common cause variation’, or the ebbs and flows found in the normal course of business; and ‘special cause variation’ which reflects abnormal events likely to result in a negative or positive ‘spike’ in forecast performance. It should be possible in the analysis of ‘actual versus expectation’ to place any variance either in the realm of common or special cause. If the spike was ‘special cause’ and thus not predictable, it will be beneficial for future forecasting to try to put in place an early indicator of such events occurring again; learning from the past is a key part of forecasting.</p>
<h3 id=""the-role-of-technology"">The role of technology</h3>
<p>According to a 2013 survey of APAC treasurers carried out by SunGard and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, 67% of respondents do not use any form of forecasting tool for cash and of those that do, 69% rely on spreadsheets. The survey also showed that of those respondents that did not use any cash flow forecasting tools, just 10% were ‘very satisfied’ with their processes, the vast majority (52%) claiming to be just ‘moderately satisfied’. The Treasury Today 2014 Asia Pacific Corporate Treasury Benchmarking Study further reveals that implementing a cash flow forecasting solution is the top technology issue and that cash flow forecasting is the number one area in need of improvement for those with an existing TMS.</p>
<p>It is clear that connected systems on a widely distributed network are the ideal when collating forecasting data. A TMS or ERP that is accessible via the web by the various business units, regardless of geography or time zone will afford direct input of their element of the cash flow forecasting data, this either being used as a continuous update or allowing the treasurer to collate, analyse and present the data relatively easily.</p>
<p>But business units that sit outside of an otherwise connected business can present data for manual entry, even if that means emailing a spreadsheet to the treasurer or picking up the phone. Despite the ‘shock, horror’ headlines of the APAC survey, a formally dedicated spreadsheet is a suitably flexible tool for the job and can be used with an ERP or TMS (see case study, opposite). However, as with all spreadsheets, care must be taken around version control, incorrect formulae and input error.</p>
<p>With the centralisation of treasury, the rise of in-house banking structures and the increased use of connected technologies and analytical tools, there is an opportunity to have better visibility over cash and cash flows. For those that choose to take advantage of these technologies, it means the ability to forecast is improving too. The models used by proprietary solutions may be far more complex than common spreadsheet formulae, but they do signify a reduction in reliance on the ‘best effort’ of an individual and a shift of emphasis towards more accurate and timely information and data support.</p>
<p>Linked with the ability to electronically move cash around the globe to optimise balances and make rapid transfers (using a pooling structure, for example), technology could play an increasingly important part in cash flow forecasting over the next few years. However, the value of significant relevant forecasting experience and an in-depth understanding of the company and the sector in which it operates should never be underestimated. It is thus advisable to consider proper ‘succession planning’, fully documenting all processes; if only one person has the knowledge, it will disappear if they leave the company.</p>
<h3 id=""banking-role"">Banking role</h3>
<p>As banks increasingly play a role around cash application, they are in a position to provide more data flows to clients related to the receipt of cash payments and the application of those payments to account balances. Some 25% of the APAC treasury survey respondents said improving cash visibility was top of their agenda.</p>
<p>But as bank products are commoditised, the banks themselves are seeking more of an advisory role to cement their relationships with their corporate clients. APAC is a complex region for treasurers not least because the diverse tax and regulatory environment makes cash optimisation challenging, especially where currency controls exist. If understanding the rules is difficult and cash visibility is an issue, in passing on their accumulated experience and understanding of integration, processes, systems and organisational structures, the larger banks with regional presence are in a position to genuinely add value to the cash forecasting process.</p>
<h3 id=""cost-benefit"">Cost/benefit</h3>
<p>That said, banks continue to have a more traditional role to fulfil. To ensure an organisation has the right level of cash and liquidity it may set up either an uncommitted or a committed facility with a bank. If, on the basis of solid forecasting, the business is reasonably confident of its cash positions going forward it may feel able to meet its liabilities in a given period. In such a case it may not need to put in place or call upon its facilities at all. However, with poor quality forecasting or in an unpredictable or volatile financial environment, there may be a need to seek bank cooperation.</p>
<p>A committed facility will cost more than an uncommitted facility, but with an uncommitted facility, if the need for cash arises simultaneously with many other businesses, bank funding may not be available. Of course, financial derivatives exist to hedge against unfavourable movements but there is a cost here too, depending on the kind of programme used. Hedging using FX forwards is cheaper than using options and can help predictability by smoothing the curve of FX variability through the neutralising effect of any gains and losses (options are better suited for those seeking the upside whilst mitigating the downside, but they attract a premium). It is all a matter of confidence in the forecast.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Treasurers who have been worrying that the scramble to meet tougher collateral requirements might price them out of the derivatives market in 2015 can breathe a sigh of relief. The prophesised collateral shortfall is not going to happen – at least not just yet.</p>
<p>Regulatory changes currently being implemented are expected to boost demand for high quality assets such as sovereign debt. Banks, of course, are now busy bolstering their liquidity ratios. Meanwhile, OTC derivatives will soon need to be collateralised and centrally cleared under new rules designed to make the $640 trillion derivatives market less risky.</p>
<p>But for all the anxiety and industry warnings, the amount of collateral available in the market continued to outstrip demand in 2014; a trend which is unlikely to change significantly in the short term. Precisely how much demand for collateral will increase once new clearing requirements for OTC derivatives come into full force is a matter of debate. The only thing that everyone agrees on is that the sums will be very vast indeed. By the estimates of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the amount of high quality collateral needed could be as much as $4 trillion, while others – notably the US Treasury – believe the figure is more likely to range between the $800 billion and $2 trillion mark.</p>
<p>Given the size of the various estimates being touted around, industry fears about a potential ‘collateral crunch’ are perhaps understandable. In early 2014, however, a joint-paper from the International Capital Markets Association (ICMA) and the European Repo Council (ERC) attempted to offer some reassurance. The study maintained that, overall, the supply of collateral would be sufficient to meet the growing demands expected in the wake of regulatory reform and changing market practices.</p>
<p>Figures cited in the report reveal that in the past six years alone the net stock of high quality assets eligible under derivatives regulations has increased by $11.3 trillion. The real question, then, is not whether there is enough collateral in the market, per se, but whether our fragmented market infrastructures can be transformed to allow for the mobilisation and delivery of the appropriate securities to where they are needed, when they are needed. It is this particular target that the securities industry has in its crosshairs right now.</p>
<h3 id=""the-collateral-highway"">The Collateral Highway</h3>
<p>“I would agree with the notion that the challenge has been slightly overstated,” says Samit Desai, Principal Consultant at Capco. It is not a question of a shortage, he explains, it is the fact that some of the collateral that will be needed may be effectively silo-ed with investors who are unwilling or perhaps unable to lend. “There are significant pools of unlent fixed-income securities in the market. But how those are accessed is the crux of the issue,” says Desai.</p>
<p>Competitive pressures between central counterparties (CCPs) and market infrastructure improvements may also ease some of the strain, he adds: “Competition between CCPs may widen the eligibility criteria, which will make it easier to post different types of collateral. In addition, a reduction in clearing fragmentation and better portfolio optimisation should result in better netting benefits for firms, and therefore the total collateral obligation may reduce.”</p>
<p>Olivier de Schaetzen, Head of Product Solutions Global Markets at Europe’s largest international central securities depository (ICSD) – Euroclear – agrees that the so-called “collateral crunch” has yet to materialise, but whether or not the astronomical figures quoted by the likes of the BIS and US Treasury are exactly right is immaterial, he points out. The market is already seeing a significantly increased need for collateral, and consequently the industry needs to ensure the appropriate infrastructure is in place to mobilise collateral – often sitting idle – across borders in a quick and efficient way. Without such measures, there is a risk of some market participants being priced out of the derivatives market in the long run, he explains.</p>

<p>Much work has already been done to this end in the past several years. Back in July 2012, Euroclear launched its global “Collateral Highway”. The global Collateral Highway, is an open, neutral infrastructure designed to help market participants move securities from wherever they are held in the world to serve as collateral for central bank liquidity, secured funding, and margins for CCPs and bilaterally cleared OTC derivative trades.</p>
<p>“It is a global infrastructure whereby liquidity providers – such as corporates, commercial banks and central banks – or risk mitigators – typically CCPs – can connect to receive securities as collateral from trading counterparties,” says de Schaetzen. “Since it is a truly global conduit we need to be able to move the right collateral seamlessly from any domestic markets into the collateral highway to where it is needed.”</p>
<p>To achieve that objective, the Collateral Highway uses multiple entry and exit points. The entry points are where collateral can be sourced through Euroclear’s central securities depositories and affiliated agent banks in every time zone. Once on the highway, the securities can then be transported to, for example, CCPs for initial margining.</p>
<h3 id=""better-together"">Better together</h3>
<p>The job is still ongoing, however. In autumn 2014, Euroclear and The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), announced the finalisation of a joint venture to create a vast, cross-border pool of collateral. The decision to join forces under a newly created company, DTCC-Euroclear Global Collateral Limited, resulted from discussions that began in 2013 around what could be done to deliver strategic solutions that respond to regulatory requirements and could be used by all market participants. It was ultimately decided that working together and leveraging each other’s strengths, not to mention avoiding a duplication of efforts, made a lot of sense.</p>
<p>“We are seeing a real focus on infrastructure now to support all these regulatory changes and this joint-venture is very much involved in this space,” says Mark Jennis, Strategy and Business Development at DTCC and Executive Chairman of DTCC-Euroclear Global Collateral Limited. The joint venture will consist of two principle services. The first of these, called the Margin Transit Utility (MTU) will provide straight through processing of margin calls, from the point of agreeing a margin call through to settlement reporting and record keeping. Secondly, the Collateral Management Utility (CMU), will be piloted, focusing on the efficient mobilisation of collateral held at both depositories. “The CMU is about being able to efficiently identify, mobilise and allocate collateral,” says Jennis. “If a client held collateral in both the US and Europe, for example, it could be pledged either to a European clearing house or go in the other direction to a US clearing house.”</p>
<p>Through initiatives such as these, much progress has evidently been made to optimise market infrastructure in recent years. This is good news from the treasurer’s perspective, of course. Yet some may still be wondering how, precisely, they can get their hands on the high quality assets they now require to hedge, and just how costly that is going to be.</p>
<h3 id=""new-territory"">New territory</h3>
<p>The truth is that collateral management is relatively unfamiliar territory for most non-financial corporates. It is something which only really began to become relevant in the corporate arena when, following the banking crisis, companies began to involve themselves in the tri-party repo market. It is an area which historically had principally been the domain of large banks, but could now be crucial in helping some corporates meeting their own collateral requirements.</p>
<p>“A lot of corporates awoke from a bad dream after September 2008, discovering that the risk they were taking on cash deposits was actually very significant,” says Euroclear’s de Schaetzen. As corporates began to accumulate liquidity in the years following the crisis, a shift in investment practices began to take place. Instead of continuing to invest their cash in unsecured term deposits taking on a single name exposure with the bank – at historically low rates, not to mention – some companies began to demand transactions be secured using reverse repos.</p>
<p>This technique enabled those companies to both mitigate the counterparty risk, and almost certainly secure a better return than they would have received through traditional deposits. “It was quite an important development for corporates,” says de Schaetzen. “The primary risk remains on the bank, but they now have collateral to cover the exposure and, in the event of a default of the bank, they can, as part of the agreement, sell collateral to recoup their cash investment.”</p>
<p>Bilateral repos can, of course, pose significant logistical challenges for treasuries in terms of the administration and risk management, particularly for those lacking experience in the market. Instead of handling all that themselves, many companies have chosen, instead, to go down the tri-party repo route, notes James Symington, Managing Principal at Capco. “The tri party agent will handle a lot of the reporting and risk management of the repos, taking some of that burden off the corporate.”</p>
<h3 id=""recycling-repos"">Recycling repos</h3>
<p>There is an added, regulatory benefit to the reverse repo, however. The collateral received typically comes in the form of high-quality bonds: the same securities, of course, demanded by CCPs for the purpose of covering derivative exposures. Corporates using the reverse repo may, therefore, find that the collateral acquired in return for their investments can create a pool of quality assets which can then be reused to cover derivatives exposures with the CCPs.</p>
<p>The advantages of recycling collateral in this way for the corporate is that it can substantially reduce funding liquidity requirements, says de Schaetzen. “If the cost of mobilising collateral is high, it could make the cost of hedging prohibitive,” says de Schaetzen. “By creating a buffer of collateral with the investment of excess liquidity in reverse repo, the treasurer doesn’t need to go into the market and borrow collateral, something which could be costly from their perspective.”</p>
<h3 id=""every-last-drop"">Every last drop</h3>
<p>How, then, can smaller companies or firms with inadequate collateral get their hands on the high quality assets they need to satisfy their obligations in the new derivatives market? The concept of collateral transformation may provide at least part of the solution. Corporates may naturally be long on other types of securities – equities or corporate bonds, for example – that do not meet the standards stipulated by the CCPs, typically for AA+ rated government debt or above. Lower quality securities like these can be upgraded, however. “The process of collateral transformation is essentially taking ineligible collateral and transforming that to collateral that can be pledged to CCPs,” explains Symington.</p>
<p>In other words, it is a service that allows a customer – such as a corporate – that is holding a certain type of asset that they do not want or need, to swap it for the type of asset they do need, and in a way that is both efficient and cost effective. Fees and a slice of the security being exchanged are typically taken by the bank in exchange for the service, and the collateral is delivered in the form of a haircut, essentially a portion of the overall value clipped from the asset. This means that in the event of a default, the creditor should be able to make the value of the securities lent whole.</p>
<h3 id=""collateral-damage"">Collateral damage</h3>
<p>The fees around collateral transformation mean that hedging in the new emerging environment is likely to increase in cost somewhat, but that will still be considerably cheaper than buying such securities on the market.</p>
<p>And, as Capco’s Desai earlier alluded to, helping market participants make the most of the collateral pools that they have through collateral optimisation should result in the improved circulation of high quality collateral, thereby helping – along with initiatives such as the Collateral Highway – to relieve the demand pressures ahead.</p>
<p>The industry knows that addressing the expected growth in demand is going to be absolutely vital from a systemic perspective. After all, if a collateral crunch were to occur, it won’t just be the banks that suffer. Collateral has become such an intrinsic feature of the modern financial system that a scarcity of it would, in fact, put the continuing operation of the markets at risk. And this, it goes without saying, would have serious repercussions for the entire global economy. As the earlier referenced ICMA and ERC report notes, “collateral is becoming the new cash, underpinning the smooth functioning of funding and capital markets, and, in turn, providing the basis for economic growth”.</p>

<p>Regulation, like death and taxation, is an immutable fact of life; for businesses the world over it applies in varying degrees of difficulty but it will always be something to deal with. “In Asia Pacific, we cover 41 countries. This means that we are continuously impacted by central banks and tax regulations,” Helen Toh, Corporate Finance – Regional Treasury Asia Pacific Deutsche Post – DHL told Treasury Today Asia in a recent interview. One of the major difficulties faced by companies such as Deutsche Post – DHL in Asia is the lack of regulatory uniformity; attempts are made to implement global or regional standards but as the old adage goes, the problem with standards is that there are just so many of them.</p>
<p>For a treasurer, keeping on top of change when change comes at you from many different angles is challenging. Whilst there are “some commonalities”, Charlotte Robins, Corporate Partner with international law firm, Norton Rose Fulbright Hong Kong, warns that businesses operating in the region “need to be cognisant of the different nuances and granular facts within each jurisdiction that may trip them up”. A simple but key consideration from a corporate perspective is understanding where it is actually doing business and how; there being no all-encompassing ‘Asian regulation’ per se. Whilst Robins notes from experience that it does not necessarily make dealing with regulation more onerous if a corporate is carrying out its business on a cross-border basis in Asia, there are still many considerations.</p>
<h3 id=""only-trying-to-help"">Only trying to help</h3>
<p>According to the World Bank’s annual ‘Doing Business’ report 2014, “governments support economic activity by establishing and enforcing rules that clarify property rights and reduce the cost of dispute resolution, increasing predictability of economic interactions”. It states too that “doing business is not about less regulation but about better regulation”. If regulators are there to help, there is clearly still work to be done: Treasury Today’s 2013 Asia Pacific Corporate Treasury Benchmarking Study reveals that 68% of treasurers see regulation as a challenge. This is more than in any other region (and up from 38% in 2012).</p>
<p>Despite this, the ‘Doing Business’ report 2014 ranks 189 countries for ‘Ease of Doing Business’. This reads as something of a Who’s Who of Asian economies. Singapore takes the number one spot, followed by Hong Kong and then New Zealand. Malaysia comes in at number six, with the Republic of Korea following in seventh place. Australia is in 11<sup>th</sup> place whilst China is 16<sup>th</sup> and Thailand 18<sup>th</sup>. Rounding off the top 20 is Mauritius. Japan is 27<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>Some territories are clearly trying to make life easier for treasury operations. Hong Kong’s Financial Secretary, John Tsang Chun-Wah, announced plans at the end of September to enable it to become a more attractive financial hub, against rivals such as Singapore. According to the South China Morning Post, the Hong Kong government has already established a taskforce “to develop proposals to attract more multinationals and mainland firms to set up corporate treasury centres in the city”.</p>
<h3 id=""a-general-view"">A general view</h3>
<p>It is apparent that some Asian markets, such as Hong Kong Australia, and Singapore, are making more regulatory progress than others. But for the treasury community, it is still the lack of any regulatory connectedness across the region that poses the biggest challenge. Blaik Wilson, Director of Solutions, APAC, for technology firm, Reval, comments that “there is a feeling sometimes that it might be three steps forward and two steps back”, he says, adding that “the intentions are good and we are seeing improvements in regulations across the board”.</p>
<p>For Robins, there are positive developments too. “Asian regulators are increasingly communicating about regulatory change, for example US or European extra-territorial regulation, about which Asian regulators are consulting one another and responding with a stronger voice,” she observes.</p>
<h3 id=""some-key-changes"">Some key changes</h3>
<p>In terms of specific regulation, Asian corporates are seeing many more (and enhanced) data privacy controls, says Robins. “The world is that much more sensitive when it comes to the transfer of data and regulators in this space are becoming increasingly active,” she notes. “As such, we are seeing a trend in Asia towards the enhancement and greater focus on the transfer and use of personal data.” A new wave of data privacy changes were implemented in 2011 across Hong Kong, South Korea, India, China, Malaysia and Taiwan. Singapore implemented changes to its data privacy laws in 2012. And proving that regulators do talk to each other, in mid-September of this year the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Monetary Authority of Singapore signed an agreement (a world first) to facilitate the mutual monitoring of OTC derivatives trading data. Under existing national data protection laws this had not been possible.</p>
<p>Money laundering, bribery and corruption is a concern for corporates everywhere. With the delivery of the European Commission’s Fourth Money Laundering Directive (4MLD), following pronouncements from the global anti-money laundering standards body, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), it is now a requirement for multinationals to have group-wide policies and procedures around data protection, the sharing of information on anti-money laundering (AML) and combating terrorist financing. The Commission expects companies to implement these policies at branch level and majority-owned subsidiaries in member states and third countries.</p>
<p>“From a corporate treasury perspective it is necessary to be aware of the issues and ultimately know who you are dealing with,” says Robins. She feels that it is incumbent upon all senior personnel to fully understand the risks inherent in their own industry and enable appropriate policies to be implemented to mitigate the issues.</p>
<h3 id=""derivatives-reform"">Derivatives reform</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most significant current regulatory event to affect the Asian financial sector flows from reform principles for OTC derivatives set during the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh Summit. Whilst those that have progressed furthest (Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and Japan) have all moved forward with trade repositories, reporting requirements and centralised clearing, there is still divergence in the detail. In the absence of a single body to oversee progress the potential exists to inadvertently undermine the G20 goals of making the global markets more transparent. Corporates will need to ensure they have read, interpreted and understood the laws and regulations correctly across each country in which they operate, warns Robins.</p>
<p>An interesting outcome for Asian OTC derivative reform will be the extent to which corporates can and will rely on their banks to report on their behalf – and indeed how this might play out for inter-company transactions (whether they are excluded or included, as they are in EMIR). Reval’s Wilson notes that many corporates maintain their own records even though their banks report on their behalf – something he feels is driven by acute corporate awareness that they still carry all the reporting responsibility. As reform rolls out across Asia, he suggests that the largest corporates may also adopt this ‘belt and braces’ approach.</p>
<p>One angle to derivatives reform that Wilson suggests many corporates may not yet have fully taken on board is the potential for a pricing differential between companies that post collateral where they have a bi-lateral agreement with the counterparty, and those that don’t.</p>
<p>Many Asian corporates do rely on their banks to post collateral on a day-to-day basis and all banks charge for doing so. “The question is, at what point does the price differential make corporates want to start posting collateral on their derivatives?” It is a difficult decision: a treasury under the obligation to manage daily posting of collateral will need to be rather more slick in how its working capital is managed to meet any shortfall. “On the systems side I think we will see companies move to more sophisticated liquidity planning and management tools,” suggests Wilson.</p>
<h3 id=""listing-differences"">Listing differences</h3>
<p>In the capital markets space, companies in Asia seeking an IPO should be aware of just how different the regulatory approaches of various stock exchanges can be. Of significant interest is the way in which the Hong Kong stock exchange (HKEx) implemented a number of changes to the process by which companies may become listed.</p>
<p>“They have not changed the financial requirements to qualify as a listed company but they have raised the level of scrutiny over first-time applicants,” notes Stephen Peepels, Head of US Capital Markets, Asia-Pacific for multinational law firm, DLA Piper Hong Kong. As of 1<sup>st</sup> May 2014, HKEx requires virtually all of the due diligence and related work to be done before a company can even submit a draft application and a prospectus to the stock exchange for listing, he explains. The sponsors must certify that all legal opinions, auditor certificates and other foundational work is substantially complete, or risk having their filing rejected. The rejection will be publicly disclosed. The potential for reputational damage if this happens should not be underestimated. As a result, he has seen a lot of commentary suggesting many Chinese companies have been “scared away” from going forward with an IPO in Hong Kong. If a company has the flexibility to think about where it lists, the view that the Hong Kong market is a more challenging one to get through may be the deciding factor. To this end, says Peepels, it is interesting that the US exchanges (NYSE and Nasdaq) “have been making a lot of effort to attract and accommodate companies from overseas to reconsider the United States as the best place to list”.</p>
<p>Following the intense scrutiny of the quality of some listed companies a decade or so ago (notably Enron in 2001), the US tightened up its rules in the mid-2000s with the passing of Sarbanes-Oxley and other measures. This may have intimidated and perhaps even prevented some companies from pursuing US listings. Peepels now sees the US regulatory pendulum as having moved back towards a more balanced and accommodating angle, allowing certain exceptions for foreign and smaller issuers, and promoting a willingness to help firms achieve their listing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, although a Hong Kong listing still has a certain prestige, as regulatory scrutiny tightens, for many companies, the question is raised as to whether it might be easier to go elsewhere, certainly for companies on the cusp of acceptability or which do not have an obvious connection to the territory. “For those that are not tied to Hong Kong, maybe they will consider exchanges that are a bit more welcoming,” comments Peepels. Indeed, he adds, some Chinese companies that had perhaps given up on listing in the United States and had decided to list in Hong Kong have now shifted back to the US.</p>
<p>NYSE was a big winner in September this year when China-based e-commerce firm Alibaba completed the largest IPO ever, raising nearly $25 billion – surpassing the 2010 record set by the Agricultural Bank of China which raised $22.1 billion in its debut on HKEx. Peepels notes that although there were other reasons informing Alibaba’s choice, it won’t change the impact generated by China’s most successful internet company going to the United States, not Hong Kong. “My guess is that the more technologically sophisticated companies seeking high-tech investors and analysts that understand their businesses are now going to have a long, hard look at the US.” There is of course no suggestion that Hong Kong’s new stricter regulatory regime will see it fall away as a desired listing venue; there will always be local companies that want a listing close to home.</p>
<p>It may seem that Hong Kong regulators are being heavy-handed in their approach; Peepels notes that HKEx often asks more “aggressive” questions about an applicant company’s existing business than would a US exchange. “The US exchanges generally believe that as long as a company is open, honest and fair with the way it describes itself, then investors are free to decide whether or not they like that company,” he says. Hong Kong regulators take a more “parochial” view of commerce and can insist that a company makes certain changes in order to satisfy the exchange’s listing requirements. As an example, where a company has a major shareholder that also invests heavily in one of that company’s core suppliers, the US would require disclosure in the prospectus of related-party transactions. HKEx can require the prospective listing company to exit that relationship or face rejection of its application.</p>
<p>Arguably this strict new regulatory approach may also play into the hands of other exchanges in the region, such as that of Singapore, which has remained on an even regulatory keel. “Its current system works well and it may be anticipating some additional listing candidates because of the approach Hong Kong is taking right now,” Peepels suggests.</p>
<h3 id=""getting-the-right-technology"">Getting the right technology</h3>
<p>With Asian businesses constantly dealing with change at a regulatory level, Reval’s Wilson puts the technological case for the software-as-a-service (SaaS) delivery model. “As the vendor, we update the software and every client gets that enhancement immediately,” he explains. “It would be a nightmare working with a client server model in Asia because instead of upgrading hundreds of clients once, it means upgrading them individually.” Arguably this is a problem for the vendor not the corporate, but unless that client has significant weight behind it, it may be lower in the order of service for each roll-out. The third option, maintaining technology in-house, could present a serious challenge for the IT department if the system is distributed across many jurisdictions.</p>
<p>This may not currently be a big issue in Asia as it is a relatively immature market for many vendors, with spreadsheet-based operations still prevalent. But it does seem as though the market is on the cusp of a major sea-change in this respect. “When Asian treasurers decide to go, they tend to want to make the leap to fully automated systems, having a vision of quite a sophisticated system at the end,” comments Wilson.</p>
<h3 id=""keep-looking"">Keep looking</h3>
<p>Working in a regulatory space that is so diverse and seemingly in a constant state of flux means Asia-based treasurers may face challenges that those elsewhere do not, but they also benefit from having a largely solid banking sector that avoided most of the troubles of the financial crisis. However, it is clear that corporates the world over do not have carte blanche to do whatever they want with their own money. In this environment, where a business simultaneously tries to optimise its finances whilst ensuring it is not jeopardising its own core operations it will increase the requirement for strong treasury oversight. Treasurers in Asia have to be ready to tackle whatever comes their way and if that means leaping regulatory hurdles, then so be it!</p>

Beyond SEPA,"

<figure class=""portrait left""><img alt=""Portrait of Claus Wild"" height=""150"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2014/10/2014-10-tt-01-qa-claus-wild-100x150.jpg"" width=""100""/></figure>
<h5 id=""claus-wild"">Claus Wild, Project Manager Payments and Cash Management, Adolf Würth GmbH &amp; Co KG:</h5>
<p>The introduction of SEPA has brought a wide range of changes for the majority of European market participants. Even though the 1<sup>st</sup> August deadline has now passed, there is still work that can be done by corporates to maximise their SEPA projects.</p>
<p>During the migration period, many participants criticised the organisational complexity and lack of harmonisation between the data formats in the SEPA area. Indeed, if we look back on the migration and the implementation of EU Regulation 260/2012 in general, corporates have been – and still are – faced with many format and country-specific deviations from the SEPA standard.</p>
<p>As a result, we are still missing homogeneous data formats in the SEPA area, and only when these are achieved will corporates be able to fully reap the efficiency benefits of their SEPA projects. Despite this, we are still at the start of the journey regarding the opportunities which SEPA can offer corporates – after the initial consolidation phase, companies will need to examine further the benefits SEPA can offer.</p>
<h5 id=""developments-and-changes"">Developments and changes</h5>
<p>As a next step, or as a part of a centralisation project, companies can now look to bundle their payments in a payment factory or in a central hub. Furthermore, companies should assess their banking landscape and terminate any redundant bank accounts.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding the treasurer’s banking administration, I expect further trends to develop. Primarily I expect corporates to increasingly require Bank Account Management (BAM) solutions and to ask for transparent bank charges (for example TWIST or camt.086 messages). Both of these should be at the top of the treasurer’s wish list over the coming months as they will allow improved control and oversight over both bank relationships and costs.</p>
<p>Since the SEPA formats are limited to the SEPA area, CGI-MP formats will continue to gain importance in the global payments space. However, these formats are limited in the range of banks which can be included, and provide, as well as the SEPA formats, a certain degree of complexity. To close the cycle of XML formats I expect increasing bank statement processing for the XML bank statements (camt.053 or camt.054). Additional challenges will arise when attempting to integrate these within the company’s ERP system.</p>
<p>Finally, companies which are primarily engaged in business-to-consumer (B2C) activities could focus their efforts on simplifying the collection from the often unloved BIC and IBAN. In addition to this, I expect increasing QR codes on invoices to facilitate the simplification. The relevant payment data is encrypted in the QR code, which can be scanned and paid easily with an app on a smartphone by the customers. The recipient will then receive the exact information they need to process the payment in the ERP system.</p>
<figure class=""portrait left""><img alt=""Portrait of Brian Hanrahan"" height=""150"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2014/10/2014-10-tt-01-qa-brian-hanrahan-100x150.jpg"" width=""100""/></figure>
<h5 id=""brian-hanrahan"">Brian Hanrahan, EVP Sales and Marketing, Sentenial:</h5>
<p>The revised SEPA end date has now passed and so in principle every business using SEPA credit transfers or direct debits will be following the new regulations. In reality there could be some stragglers, particularly direct debit users who, say, collect annually, but these will be a very small percentage of the total.</p>
<p>All but a small number of companies with particular needs treated the move to SEPA as a regulatory issue, something that had to be done at a cost but something that generated little or no business benefit. A direct consequence of this was that businesses left migration to the last minute only to discover it was actually more difficult than they had anticipated leading in turn to project overruns.</p>
<p>Whilst businesses had ten years to plan for this, the last minute dash has resulted in many tactical solutions being deployed that are not necessarily optimum in terms of efficiency or the features they support. With material volumes of transactions now flowing through SEPA we are gradually seeing the schemes settle down to more of a business as usual, stable process. Progressively inconsistencies and uncertainties are being ironed out, it has to be remembered that the processes are nearly as new for the banks and infrastructure as they are for businesses.</p>
<p>Actual experience of a process is invaluable and based on this we are seeing growing interest in implementing more robust solutions and solutions which better fit a business user’s environment. Apart from improving the solidity of the processes used to generate the new SEPA data, businesses are also looking at mechanisms to deal with the exceptions produced by the scheme, the so-called R messages. Another area that has caused confusion, particularly for direct debit users, is reconciling the process in terms of balancing what money businesses expect to receive with what actually arrives in their bank account. Much confusion here results from the differing clearing cycles applied to the first and subsequent collection in the debit scheme, something which did not happen in most legacy schemes.</p>
<p>For the small number of businesses that operate in a multinational way within the Eurozone, other opportunities also exist to rationalise banking relationships. Very few businesses undertook this before the end date, but now some are embarking on projects to review the benefits that may arise from this process. Businesses operating within a single country could opt to use a different bank, either in their own or another country to reduce costs, but there is not much evidence of this happening.</p>
<p>Another area attracting attention is the use of paperless mandates in the direct debit process. The functionality is required by a significant percentage of users but has been badly handled within SEPA. Many countries had well established procedures for paperless mandates before SEPA and the move back to a paper-based environment is not seen as very progressive. There is still considerable confusion on this topic both with business users and banks alike. This is an area where solutions are now emerging and the market may dictate the outcome rather than the scheme, simply down to the time being spent to resolve.</p>
<figure class=""portrait left""><img alt=""Portrait of Francis de Roeck"" height=""150"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2014/10/2014-10-tt-01-qa-francis-de-roeck-100x150.jpg"" width=""100""/></figure>
<h5 id=""francis-de-roeck"">Francis de Roeck, Head of SEPA Offering, BNP Paribas Cash Management:</h5>
<p>The SEPA migration is now complete in euro countries. The figures speak for themselves, with SEPA Credit Transfers (SCTs) being fully migrated as of July 2014 (98.47% rate according to the European Central Bank); whereas the SEPA Direct Debit (SDD) showed a 97.01% migration rate. It is interesting to see that SDD volumes took off at a very late stage of the SEPA calendar.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the original end-date for the 18 countries of the Eurozone was 1<sup>st</sup> February 2014. However, an additional six months were granted by the European Institutions to allow for all economic players concerned to smoothly complete their migration.</p>
<p>Even though the migration period is now behind us, SEPA remains high on the agenda. For example, countries that declared niche products are now looking to replace these products either by integrating them into existing schemes or by introducing Additional Optional Services (AOS). Stakeholders are still addressing the topic of niche products, and no final decision on how they will be replaced in February 2016 has been made as yet.</p>
<p>Some countries (eg Italy, Spain, and Portugal) have also requested a waiver on legacy formats, meaning that corporates can still use non-XML formats; meanwhile banks will continue converting them until February 2016. However, given the current volumes still being handled in legacy formats, a heavy migration effect is still to come.</p>
<p>Looking more closely at the implementation of SEPA, the SEPA workflow is now up and running. Considerable volumes are being handled, with more than 36 billion credit transfers and direct debits being exchanged. To date, corporates have mainly focused on migrating, however, and the full benefits of SEPA have not yet been leveraged.</p>
<h5 id=""the-next-step"">The next step</h5>
<p>Now that SEPA is a reality, corporates can develop a more concrete, broader sense of the initiative’s potential. At BNP Paribas, we believe that SEPA is a strong driver for treasury centralisation: payment and collection factories with frequent payments and collections-on-behalf-of (PoBo and CoBo) can all be enabled through SEPA. We have supported countless migrations on behalf of EU and non-EU corporates, and we know that beyond the regulatory and compliance aspects, SEPA is seen as a facilitator for standardisation and harmonisation. Moreover, the richness of SEPA XML reporting should typically ease the reconciliation process. Most of the benefits come from streamlining internal processes, rather than from the optimisation of bank relationships.</p>
<p>Corporates are now in a position to significantly reduce operational and processing costs and improve their treasury through greater automation and bank rationalisation. However, some challenges are still keeping them from taking full advantage of SEPA, and significantly improving their order-to-cash cycle as a result.</p>
<p>Today, it is important for non-EU companies to understand the momentum that SEPA has created in Europe if they want to take advantage of the latest market trends. For example, the standardisation brought by SEPA actually makes it possible to optimise the implementation of treasury projects.</p>

Regulating derivatives in Asia,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>European treasurers who thought their EMIR compliance projects were tough going should spare a thought for their Asia Pacific counterparts. After all, a pan-European corporate, with a footprint in every Western European country only had to deal with two sets of regulations, at most; the EU and Swiss regimes. For a pan-Asia corporate with operations in each of the 17 independently regulated Asian markets, the regulatory headache is inevitably going to be much more severe.</p>
<p>The market for OTC derivatives in Asia is small in relative terms, comprising as it does, a mere 8% of the current global turnover. But demand for risk management products is growing. In 2012, there was $42.6 trillion in notional outstanding in the Asian financial markets – a 25% increase from 2011 figures according to a Celent study published last year.</p>
<p>With derivatives now assuming increased importance to the treasurers of Asia-based corporates, understanding the changes required in the jurisdictions within which the company operates will be vital. In this article we will look at the current state of play in the Asian derivatives markets, how the changes will impact corporates, and how the regulatory environment might develop in the years ahead.</p>
<h3 id=""the-state-of-play"">The state of play</h3>
<p>So, where are we at the moment? As of July 2014, four of the major jurisdictions in the Asia Pacific region – Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan – have begun to introduce regulations in line with the reform principles for OTC derivatives as set out by the G20 committee in 2009. The general objectives of these regulations are broadly the same as under Dodd-Frank and EMIR. However, each country is moving at its own pace and with its own priorities.</p>
<p>But some common trends can be observed. Already, we can see that Asia’s regulators have each decided to take a more phased approach with different deadlines for different types of market participants. A majority of countries seem to be leaning towards an EMIR-like reporting model in which both sides report, and most have begun with the creation of trade repositories and reporting requirements before tackling centralised clearing. But, as we will see, that is more or less where the similarities end.</p>
<p>Australia, for instance, began by introducing mandatory trade reporting for registered swap dealers – typically large banks – back in October 2013, which was followed in April 2014 by a deadline for major financial institutions to begin reporting interest rate and credit derivative trades. The timetable for other financial institutions and corporates to begin reporting their trades has not yet been confirmed. An October deadline for other buy-side organisations to begin reporting is expected to be postponed by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), and it is also looking likely that Australia will follow the precedent set by Dodd-Frank and exempt end users such as corporates from the reporting obligation. Central clearing proposals are still in the consultation stage and a mandate is expected in 2015.</p>
<p>Reporting in Singapore, meanwhile, began around the same time as Australia but was restricted to interest rate and credit asset classes. At first, reporting was voluntary but it became mandatory for a prescribed list of banks in February; a list which was expanded to include most banks and dealer entities in on 1<sup>st</sup> April. A deadline for corporates to begin reporting – the first requirement that will be applied outside the banking sector – has been confirmed for September, but as yet there has not been any confirmation of the timetable for central clearing.</p>
<p>Japan was the earliest mover in Asia Pacific, and the only jurisdiction to attempt the introduction of reporting and central clearing in parallel. Yen-denominated interest rate swaps and credit default swaps that referenced Japanese indices came under mandatory clearing requirements in November 2012 and expansion of this mandate is currently under discussion. Reporting for banks also began at the same time for each of the main asset classes, with the exception of commodities.</p>
<p>Finally, in Hong Kong all the necessary legislation is in place but is, as yet, to come into full effect. Clearing mandates are expected to become effective later in the year – although, at the time of writing, a formal announcement from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has not yet been made. A formal mandate for trade reporting, to replace an interim rule that requires banks to report interest rate and non-deliverable forward (NDF) trades to the Hong Kong Trade Repository (HKTR) is also expected to be in effect by the beginning of 2015.</p>

<h3 id=""step-by-step"">Step-by-step</h3>
<p>Taking a more measured, incremental approach to implementation does have certain advantages. We saw in Europe, for example, how onboarding bottlenecks, and a host of other problems, were created because of the need to do so much in such a short space of time. Even some of the banks who, unlike corporates, have vast armies of compliance experts, confessed to be struggling under the sheer weight of the regulatory burden during the implementation stage of EMIR. For most entities in Asia, however, the load should be more manageable.</p>
<p>“There is awareness of the fact that each of the segments have different challenges,” says Peter Tierney, Regional Head, Asia at DTCC. “The large banks are quite sophisticated from a technology perspective, and also have experience reporting across jurisdictions. But at a corporate level, the sophistication – in terms of tracking and managing trades – is different. I believe that regulators in Singapore and Australia recognise these different states of readiness.”</p>
<p>There are also signs that Asia Pacific countries are waiting to see more precisely what impact US and European regulation will have on the derivatives markets. Taking that approach, the regulators are able to learn from what has worked well and apply those lessons in their own jurisdictions. “We have spent a lot of time talking with regulators across Asia about trade reporting processes in other regions as well as provided insights on how market participants are already reporting elsewhere,” says Tierney.</p>
<h3 id=""a-regulatory-patchwork"">A regulatory ‘patchwork’</h3>
<p>Does the fact that the region is looking to learn from other regulators mean that, somewhere down the line, we will see the same level of regulatory consistency as in Europe or the US? That seems improbable, given that it would require each jurisdiction in the region to surrender some sovereignty over their domestic markets to a pan-Asian regulatory organisation. And with regulation bringing with it such great opportunities for arbitrage, that is difficult to conceive, says Zohar Hod, Global Head of Sales and Support at SuperDerivatives. “I do see some harmonisation,” he begins. “But for some countries in Asia it is simply not in their interest. The whole point of China launching six different exchanges, for example, is that they want to become the centre for financial transactions. I think they are going to be taking an approach that says ‘here it is going to be a bit different’, in order to attract business to the Shanghai markets.”</p>
<p>Might the lack of harmony undermine the push to shine more light on these markets which was, after all, the fundamental goal of the reforms in the first place? One expert who is worried that might be the case is Malavika Shekar, a Senior Consultant for the capital markets advisory firm GreySpark who recently published a study on the regulatory progress which made in Asia’s OTC derivatives markets. “A myriad of different regulations are cropping up across the region without one body having oversight of the big picture,” Shekar says. “This certainly has the potential to undermine the G20 goals of making the global markets more transparent.”</p>
<p>On the ground, it could pose a huge challenge for corporate treasurers and other end users. There will be some jurisdictions in Asia where both corporates and banks will be required to report, somewhere only the bank has to and some where all asset classes are subject to reporting requirements. Interpreting these rules will require some time. “Corporates will need to ensure they have read, interpreted and understood the laws and regulations correctly across a number of different countries,” says DTCC’s Tierney.</p>
<h3 id=""no-escape"">No escape</h3>
<p>In the years ahead, hedging practices for Asia Pacific’s corporates will clearly be shaped, enormously, by the G20 market reform commitments now being implemented. It is not just regulation from within that is going to drive change through the region’s markets, wherever Dodd-Frank and EMIR apply in any jurisdiction in which US and EU institutions operate, and both require derivatives contracts to be cleared through central counterparties (CCPs) approved by the European Securities and Markets Authority (Esma) or the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission respectively. What’s more, even Asian market participants will find Dodd-Frank and EMIR rules difficult to escape from if they are dealing with US or EU counterparties, since they will also be required to comply with the respective regulations regardless of where their transactions are made.</p>
<p>Clearly the regulatory framework in Asia Pacific remains in a state of flux. But with the extraterritorial reach of regulations elsewhere adding an extra layer of complexity to the web of new rules now emerging in the region, corporates really have no time to lose. Even in jurisdictions, such as Australia, where corporates may well find themselves exempt from trade reporting obligations – and clearing mandates too, if they keep below certain thresholds – the impact will still be felt. With trades shifting from bilateral trading and dark pools to clearing and electronic trading platforms, corporates end users may have to make the transition anyway to retain their access to liquidity.</p>

<p>So what can treasurers do now to prepare themselves? The first step should be to perform a careful examination of the company’s treasury technology and its capabilities when it comes to types of data that might need to be reported. “The biggest problem for firms reporting under EMIR was gathering all the right information and collating it,” explains SuperDerivatives’ Hod. Asian treasurers won’t have to climb that same, steep learning curve if they begin their preparations now though. That might involve taking a report from DTCC or one of the other swap data repositories and then figuring out what, if any, gaps there are. “Perform an exercise to help you understand what needs to be reported,” he says. “I would definitely do that in order to be prepared for any future requirements.”</p>
<p>Corporates who need to begin reporting in Singapore in September should already have a good idea about where those gaps are, but treasurers elsewhere in Asia might need to wait a little bit longer before they can begin an evaluation. “For many countries, the necessary format to report in is still non-existent,” adds Hod. “For that reason, I wouldn’t worry about it for 2014 – but it is certainly something I would put on my future project list if I were a treasurer.” The corporates in the region that do this might just find their compliance projects actually run more smoothly than those of their counterparts in Europe and the US did.</p>

Key trends in bank regulation,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>In the aftermath of the recent financial crisis, G20 leaders met in Washington DC to agree a blueprint for reform of global financial markets. The regulatory burden on banks has grown exponentially in the time that has passed since then and it is affecting not just the banks themselves but, increasingly, their corporate clients too.</p>
<p>The list of what a corporate treasurer needs to know about bank regulation is a long one, but there are a handful of distinct themes that dominate. This article, although far from exhaustive, will shed some light on these themes by sketching a broad outline of the emerging regulatory landscape and the key implications for corporate treasury functions.</p>
<h3 id=""bank-finance"">Bank finance</h3>
<p>A change in both the cost and availability of bank finance is undoubtedly the most significant development where treasurers are concerned. Ever since the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision announced tougher capital and liquidity rules, banks have been warning that customers will face more costly credit – or perhaps find it difficult to access altogether – as a result. “Basel III makes us more thoughtful of who the end holders of assets should be, in whatever form,” explains Nick Burge, Managing Director and Head of OTC Clearing at Lloyds Bank. In the post-Basel III world, holdings of longer-dated capital-heavy assets will continue to shift away from the banks to institutions such as insurance companies and pension funds who want longer-term exposures. Banks, meanwhile, “continue to act as arrangers between borrowers and end investors and to provide more of the shorter-term, revolving facilities that banks are best placed to manage,” Burge adds.</p>
<p>There are signs that the banking community was not exaggerating when it claimed that the Basel capital requirements – a risk-weighted capital ratio of 4.5% plus an additional buffer of 2.5% – would have a sizeable impact on longer-term business lending activities. In Europe, despite a prolonged period of ultra-low interest rates, bank lending has remained weak while corporate bond issuance – thanks also in part to unconventional monetary policies – has soared to record levels. As companies continue to flock to the capital markets we are already witnessing a shift in the composition of the corporate debt stack. In Europe, bonds accounted for 18% of the funding mix in the three years before the crisis. In the three years since 2011, they have averaged 31%.</p>
<p>The retreat of bank finance means that those in the SME sector, lacking the capital markets recourse of their corporate peers, are finding credit increasingly difficult to access. “Europe has certainly gone through a period of very weak economic activity and weaker, higher costing bank lending,” says Clive Briault, Senior Advisor, EMA Financial Services at KPMG. “At a time when macro prudential analysis is telling us that we probably need to release some capital, banks are being encouraged to hold more.” Causation is difficult to disentangle, Briault adds, but one could argue that “all that it is doing is having a very pro-cyclical effect, by reinforcing the downward part of the cycle.”</p>

<p>Perhaps one small blessing for corporates is the relief Europe granted last year to trade finance from the required one-year maturity rule for risk-weighted assets and a move back to the 20% credit conversion factor for secured letters of credit (LC). Had the regulation remained as originally drafted, all exposures – including low-risk, short-term and self-liquidating trade instruments such as LCs – would have been treated as equally risky. That would have almost certainly pushed up the cost of trade finance, with some estimates suggesting an increase of as much as 75 basis points.</p>
<h3 id=""growing-importance-of-scf"">Growing importance of SCF</h3>
<p>While traditional forms of credit are likely to retrench in the wake of Basel III, certain forms of credit such as the provision of receivables-based and supply chain finance (SCF) are likely to receive a significant boost. The reasons are twofold. Firstly, the constraints that bank regulation continues to exert upon bank lending to SMEs, will almost certainly encourage more of these businesses to consider alternative methods of funding the business. Meanwhile, corporate buyers are increasingly cognisant of the pressure the credit shortage is putting on their supply chains, and are looking for ways to bolster the balance sheets of their suppliers, while improving their own working capital. SCF, which has been growing at a rate of 25-30% since the crisis, would seem like the ideal solution for both parties.</p>
<p>The second point is that SCF will become a more attractive activity for banks following the full implementation of the Basel Committee’s recommendations. This is because relative to other types of facility, SCF is deemed to be fairly low risk and will therefore remain low cost, Anil Walia, Head of Supply Chain Finance at RBS, explains. “While LCs are likely to become more expensive, receivables purchasing through SCF programmes will become cheaper for the banks,” says Walia. “Since they will be able to provide that at a reduced cost that is where the funds will start flowing in the years.”</p>
<h3 id=""changing-relationships"">Changing relationships</h3>
<p>Other banking regulations implemented in the past year are impacting companies in a more direct way. Trade reporting regulations – such as the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) – are one example. Under EMIR, corporates that use OTC derivatives products will be required to report trades to one of the newly appointed trade repositories.</p>
<p>For corporates who have never been directly subject to financial regulation before, achieving compliance ahead of the deadline has required them to climb a very steep learning curve. In order to do that, a large number have had to draw upon the expertise of their banking partners. “Treasurers are now finding themselves subject to a whole set of regulations that are often quite complex and lengthy,” says Lloyds’ Burge. “They are very conscious of how big the range of different requirements they need to understand is, and that has required a lot of education.”</p>
<p>On that point, there is a large degree of consensus. “Everyone is suffering from the range and complexity of these requirements,” says Ruth Wandhöfer, Global Head of Regulatory and Market Strategy at Citi Transaction Services. On the positive side, the regulatory burden is at least fostering closer relationships between corporates and their banking partners – something which is increasingly vital for businesses attempting to navigate the changing regulatory landscape. “Sometimes it becomes a community of shared suffering, which is of course good for client relationships in the sense that you always have something to talk about,” she jokes. Citi, she adds, is therefore working hard to make sense of the ever-expanding plethora of regulatory changes and communicating what needs to be done to corporate clients.</p>
<h3 id=""the-threat-of-balkanisation"">The threat of Balkanisation</h3>
<p>One of the chief concerns of local financial regulators since the crisis has been to prevent the need to rescue large cross-border banks from collapse in future financial crises. This is driving structural change within the banking sector. An increasing number of national regulators – notably Germany and the UK – are bringing in requirements stipulating that banks operate within their jurisdictions not as branches, but as subsidiaries, each with enough capital to stand alone. For a large international bank, that, in essence, means an end to many of the advantages that can be derived from the pooling of capital and liquidity, such as being able to use surpluses in one country to fund deficits in another.</p>
<p>A shift from a largely global system of entities into a patchwork of smaller, locally funded and regulated subsidiaries will likely be a source of alarm to treasurers of multinational companies. It is certainly one of the trends that worries Wandhöfer the most. “That has the potential to – greatly influence global banking in the long run. I think it could have a huge impact on the network. While suggesting that this type of regulatory response would make delivering these services all but impossible for banks would be an overstatement, it is not difficult to see how it might affect the cost.”</p>
<p>A bank’s ability to move liquidity inter-company on behalf of a client is enormously dependent upon being able to move the funds between branches seamlessly. If the system becomes too fragmented, the result might be that transactions will require the use of external clearing systems. That will mean costs will rise and transactions will need to be submitted earlier, Wandhöfer explains. “Ultimately it could mean that everything becomes more expensive and less efficient for the corporate.” KPMG’s Briault agrees. “Increasing localisation or ‘Balkanisation’ is likely to make it more expensive for international banking groups across the world to operate and that will inevitably push up the price of their services to end users, such as global corporates, too.”</p>
<h3 id=""its-not-over-yet"">It’s not over yet</h3>
<p>Given all the disruption and uncertainty that has resulted, treasurers will surely be eager for the process of regulatory upheaval within the banking sector to culminate soon. However, there are still a lot of issues under discussion – not least where Basel III is concerned.</p>
<p>“I think we are about halfway through,” Briault says. A KPMG report published last September, which Briault co-authored, describes it in more striking terms. Even though the original 2019 deadline for the final phase of Basel III implementation is still some way off, some regimes may yet shift towards a ‘Basel IV’ standard characterised by tougher requirements on the leverage ratio, risk-weighted assets and stress testing. Differences are already emerging. The US and European authorities, for instance, are requiring banks to meet minimum capital ratios after a severe stress test, while others are moving minimum leverage ratios above the prescribed 3%. There is not going to be much respite then. In fact, it could be the case that by the time banks are finally able to fully meet the new regulatory requirements, they will already be out of date.</p>
<p>Corporates, when not managing compliance projects of their own, will need to continue monitoring developments and trying to understand the implications. That might involve, amongst other things, budgeting for increased bank fees and performing regular assessments of the impact upon interest income and expenses.</p>
<p>Developing an awareness of the potential macroeconomic consequences might also give treasurers an edge in the practise of risk management. A growing fear amongst banks is that the relentless regulatory onslaught may already be taking economies – Europe in particular – past the “tipping point” to where the costs far exceed the benefits. If the range of services banks provide to their corporate clients continue to rise in cost, KPMG believes a potentially permanent downward drag on economic growth could manifest, exceeding any benefits gained from improved stability. It would be sensible for treasurers, therefore, to anticipate – or at least not rule out – future periods of financial instability and adjust their strategies accordingly.</p>
<p>As regulatory pressures on banks continue to grow, corporates will continue to look at funding alternatives such as the capital markets, says Briault. Banks will always be needed for payments and basic cash management services, he explains, but greater fragmentation might necessitate treasury to take more of “a pick and mix approach” rather than relying on one banking group for all their funding and liquidity needs.</p>
<p>Finally, if global banking continues to gradually fragment, corporates that traditionally partner with one or several banks internationally might need to change their approach. “Treasurers may find that some banks are pulling out of certain locations as the costs of services go up due to localisation pressures,” says Briault. “That is a change they should be preparing themselves for now.”</p>

Company Law in China,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<figure class=""portrait left""><img alt=""Portrait of David Ling"" height=""150"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2014/05/2014-05and06-tta-02-qa-david-ling-100x150.jpg"" width=""100""/></figure>
<h5 id=""david-ling-tax-partner-kpmg-china"">David Ling, Tax Partner, KPMG China:</h5>
<p>In China there are two main forms of company, domestic companies and Foreign Investment Enterprises (FIEs). Historically, Chinese Company Law has only covered domestic companies. In recent years however, amendments have been made allowing FIE regulations to mirror those of domestic companies, but these changes are often introduced some time after the domestic regulations and are often watered down. Although the 1<sup>st</sup> March 2014 Company Law revisions have been introduced for FIEs, the full nature of these has yet to be disclosed. The Ministry of Commerce will shortly issue circulars to incorporate the revisions to current rules governing FIEs.</p>
<p>The first major change which the revised Company Law has introduced is the removal of minimum registered capital requirements. Companies are no longer required to submit government specified capital when registering a business. Instead, they can decide internally how much capital they wish to register. There are certain industries, however, such as banks and insurance companies, which still have to comply with the legacy minimum registered capital requirements.</p>
<p>A second key change is that the capital contribution period has been removed. Companies therefore no longer have to comply with strict timeframes to supply their registered capital and this again can now be a decision made internally.</p>
<p>The removal of the contribution ratio when a new company is established is another change introduced with the revised Company Law. This revision now permits companies to decide themselves what ratio of intangible and tangible items they wish to use, as contributions for their registered capital allowing for greater flexibility.</p>
<p>Another change sees the removal of the capital verification requirements. In the past, verification was required by regulatory bodies for any capital being contributed. While contributions such as cash have often been easy to verify, items such as machinery have not. This often complicates and slows down the registration process.</p>
<p>To provide an example of this, if a company is required to contribute $1m upon registration, half cash and half machinery, the cash could be simply verified, however the machinery will need to be imported and processed through a number of authorities who may value the machinery less than the company. If this happens there can be a shortfall in the registered capital, requiring more cash or machinery to be introduced. The company will also be required to renew their previous approval documents which can be a long and arduous process. Thanks to the removal of these procedures the registration process is now greatly simplified and the workload for treasurers is reduced.</p>
<p>Overall, the revisions to the Chinese Company Law have simplified the company registration period in China. In doing so the role of the corporate treasurer has also been made easier. In the past they would be required to calculate the registered capital, the capital contribution period and also manage the verification process. Now, thanks to the revisions, these requirements have been removed and transformed into internal company decisions rather than government requirements. Looking to the future I think there will be further improvement. The government ultimately wishes to move towards a market-oriented economy and already a large amount of government approval procedures have been either simplified or renewed. This is a trend which the Company Law fits and one which we can expect to continue in the future.</p>

<h5 id=""sun-hong-partner-and-tony-zhong-associate-norton-rose-fulbright"">Sun Hong, Partner and Tony Zhong, Associate, Norton Rose Fulbright:</h5>
<p>The Company Law amendments are one of the reforming initiatives taken by the new leadership of China to stimulate non-governmental capital investment and economic activities. The ultimate aim of all these reforms is to further develop China’s corporate system as well as the overall economic system more broadly, on a free market basis with less intervention from the government.</p>
<p>The key changes under the new laws will see the abolition of minimal capital requirements, for companies of all types, unless there are any special requirements under the laws, administrative regulations or decisions made by the State Council. Paid-in capital will also no longer be one of the registration items required on the business licence of a company, which will now only display the capital subscribed by the shareholders. Furthermore, the legacy timeframes which dictate when registered capital will need to be paid in will cease to apply, unless otherwise falling within the exceptions. Finally, capital verification reports evidencing shareholders’ actual capital contribution will also no longer be required by the State Administration for Industry or Commerce or its local counterparts.</p>
<p>The key theme of the Company Law amendments is to change the capital registration system from the legacy system to a subscribed capital registration system. This batch of amendments however only reflects part of the registered capital reform which is being rolled out across China. Other elements of the reform include the government changing its annual inspection system to an annual reporting system. The establishment of a credible system is another reform which will be accomplished through making registration records, annual reports, and qualification documents of all enterprises publicly available on electronic platforms. Finally the legacy residency requirements for enterprises in China will also be relaxed under the proposed reforms.</p>
<p>In the coming months we can also expect to see other regulatory changes including allowing listed companies determined by the China Security Regulatory Commission to be able to issue preferred shares publically. Furthermore, we can expect to see both listed and non-listed public companies able to issue non-public preferred shares once the draft regulations have been finalised.</p>
<p>The amendment of laws concerning foreign invested enterprises (FIE laws) has also been put on the agenda of the National People’s Congress. The market expects that the new FIE laws will resolve existing inconsistencies with the Company Law and a more flexible legal regime for foreign investment in China. Finally, various other administrative regulations and provisions will be amended by the State Council in the next few months, to correspond with and supplement the Company Law amendments.</p>
<p>In light of the recent capital registration system reforms, corporate treasurers may enjoy more flexibility in structuring capital payment arrangements while making new investments into China. Existing operations in China will also benefit from a (generally speaking) more relaxed regulatory environment going forward. However, the fundamental regulatory regime governing foreign-invested enterprises (including the foreign exchange control over cross-border flow of funds under capital items) still remains in place. The Chinese government has determined to introduce further reforms to the administrative and economic systems and there are more expected. It is worthwhile for corporate treasurers to keep a close eye on the further evolvement of China’s regulatory landscape so as to take advantage of the further opening-up of the world’s second-largest economy.</p>

<h5 id=""wei-liu-corporate-partner-pinsent-masons"">Wei Liu, Corporate Partner, Pinsent Masons:</h5>
<p>China’s refreshed company law represents a steep change for the country’s economy as the authorities seek to nurture new businesses and entrepreneurial flair in mainland China. Promoting the domestic private sector on a global scale is at the heart of the simplified rules as China now reflects the company law structure of buoyant economies such as Hong Kong and the UK.</p>
<p>A number of onerous rules have been abolished to pave the way for a surge in new Chinese businesses, particularly fledgling start-ups with relatively minimal cash flow. These companies will now no longer be constrained by the 30% required cash contribution. For lucrative businesses, unlocking these funds boosts liquidity, providing cash flow to invest in growth and development.</p>
<p>Statutory minimum thresholds for registered capital, capital contributions and documentation to verify paid-in capital all acted as a deterrent to new business ventures in China. These obstacles have now been stripped out, reducing barriers to entry for domestic companies.</p>
<p>Is there a global impact? Absolutely. Domestic Chinese companies will now have more ‘pulling power’ when looking to attract overseas joint venture partners. Increased liquidity leads to more investment and drives opportunities to operate on a global scale.</p>
<p>Transparency of finances is of paramount importance as companies are now required to file annual reports, prompting a fresh approach to ethical and responsible business practices. In time, this will be a selling point to international entities looking to establish tie-ups with lucrative and successful Chinese businesses.</p>
<p>The new flexible laws are a turning point for China’s economy but benefits will not be instantaneous. There will be a gradual process requiring education and support as businesses transition from the old system to the new. But with flexibility comes opportunity to expand and promote Chinese businesses on a global scale.</p>

SEPA: here we go again,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>In the end, they did the sensible thing. Just weeks prior to the Single Euro Payment Areas (SEPA) migration date, the European Commission added a six month transition period to give companies more time before legacy payments systems are switched off for good. As a result, banks and businesses in Eurozone countries will have until 1<sup>st</sup> August 2014 to comply with the new standards for direct debit and credit transfer transactions.</p>
<p>The grace period will surely be welcomed by those businesses still struggling with the many technical challenges associated with SEPA compliance. They are more than a few in number. The latest figures from the ECB, released mid-January, reveal that 83.13% of credit transfers and just 60.23% of direct debits were SEPA-compliant in December 2013. But the reality is that the transition period offers nothing more than a little breathing space for these companies. The eyes of most corporates should now be fixed firmly – like those of the banks and the regulators – on the next stage.</p>
<p>But what will phase two of SEPA look like? For corporates, it will largely depend on the geographical footprint of the business and how the treasury is organised. What is clear though, is that following compliance, corporates will see opportunities for efficiency gains in a pan-European payments landscape. In fact, SEPA is just the beginning. As the remaining businesses in Europe go live with SEPA’s ISO 20022 XML standards, some industry experts are predicting that those same formats could be the key to extending bulk payment instructions beyond the Eurozone and pushing far greater adoption of e-initiatives.</p>
<h3 id=""the-single-account-dream"">The single account dream</h3>
<p>Up until this point, corporates have mostly tended to view SEPA strictly as a compliance project. The number one priority was to ensure the terms of the SEPA regulation were met, allowing the business to continue to process transactions without disruption after the so called end-date of 1<sup>st</sup> February 2014. Those who have successfully migrated their systems can now begin shifting their focus away from pure compliance to the opportunities that SEPA brings.</p>
<p>By far the biggest opportunity for companies with a pan-European footprint is to use SEPA to centralise payables and receivables. They can do this by shedding their framework of in-country euro accounts in favour of a payments/collections factory which can execute and process transactions on behalf of one or more subsidiaries. A corporate may also reach a point where only one operational euro account is needed across the entire continent.</p>
<p>“That should be the end goal,” says Steve Everett, Managing Director, Global Transaction Services, RBS. “Companies will now be thinking about rationalising down, as far as possible, all their euro bank accounts and the administration that goes around them.”</p>
<p>European multinationals (MNCs) will already be well aware of the efficiency gains that centralisation has to offer. Reduced bank fees are the most obvious of these, but precisely how much can be saved will vary from business to business. Some corporates, like Ages Maut System, a Germany-based provider of transnational toll systems across Europe, are expecting to make only modest savings. Treasury performed a cost-benefit analysis early on in the migration process which indicated that reduced bank fees could save the business as much as €10,000 a year. “There are a number of accounts we don’t need any more and typically they were a lot more expensive than our accounts here in Germany,” says Peter Frambach, Head of International Payment Services at Ages Maut System.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those who have successfully migrated their systems can now begin shifting their focus away from pure compliance to the opportunities that SEPA brings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Frambach could be forgiven for not feeling as though he has just hit the jackpot, however. For creditors doing direct debits on an ‘at sight’ basis, shortened cut-off times and longer presentation periods for direct debits can mean an inevitable and substantial loss on the interest returned on deposits or spend on loans. Although rates are presently at all time lows, Frambach calculates that with interest rates closer to their 20-year average of 6%, a company with a monthly turnover of €20m collected with direct debits loses just under €60,000 each year on such delays for B2B and COR1 direct debits. If the company were to opt for CORE direct debits, the interest gap rockets up further. This is even before taking into consideration the €400,000 the company has already spent becoming compliant in the first place.</p>
<p>Tangible cost savings will not be seen at every European company and will often not level out the costs implied with SEPA compliance (whether direct debit-related or otherwise), although there will likely be efficiency and process improvements. As Frambach acknowledges, the benefits that can be drawn from SEPA vary from business-to-business. Certainly, companies like the Dutch multinational AkzoNobel that found SEPA beneficial when establishing payments and collections factories.</p>
<p>Unlike many companies beginning to look at centralisation now after compliance has been achieved, AkzoNobel’s treasury began work back in 2010, two years prior to the official announcement of the SEPA end-date. First, a payments factory was established to make payments on behalf of the company’s European entities. SEPA was not essential for the establishment of the payments factory, but the abolition of charges on cross-border transactions was certainly beneficial. The end result was one account for euro payments. The process has since been replicated in receivables, with the establishment of a collections factory.</p>
<p>“We quantified the savings internally and it is in the millions,” says Gerwin Braam, Senior Bank Manager and SEPA Project Manager at AkzoNobel. But are there not benefits beyond savings on bank fees, such as greater control and visibility? “Exactly, that is also another big benefit,” says Braam. “You have much more visibility over cash flow and can see quite easily where money is at any given time.”</p>
<h3 id=""innovation"">Innovation</h3>
<p>In the next few years, SEPA is also going to be a momentous driver of innovation in the transaction banking and corporate treasury world. Many treasurers have been using the momentum of SEPA projects to restructure or improve their operations, while banks are beginning to develop new products and solutions to facilitate the treasury drive towards greater efficiency.</p>
<p>An example of this is virtual accounts. “That’s becoming a really hot topic,” says RBS’ Everett. Essentially, virtual accounts are structures that enable businesses to establish a number of subaccounts within one master account. These structures address the reconciliation difficulties that arise through bank account rationalisation by enabling a corporate to provide a unique identifier to each of its clients. Individual transactions can then be directed to a particular virtual account against which receipts can be directly noted. “They could, in practice, get a virtual account for each supplier,” adds Everett. “It enables corporates to achieve a much more streamlined, automated approach around reconciliation.”</p>
<p>But the drive to greater efficiency will not stop there. Having already overcome the challenge of introducing XML as part of their SEPA migration, corporates may find it worthwhile looking at some of the other ISO 20222 XML-based solutions offered by their various banking partners. One of these is Electronic Bank Account Management (eBAM). To date, corporate uptake of eBAM solutions has been minimal but now, with swathes of companies across Europe using the corresponding messaging standard, we could be about to witness a spike in interest.</p>
<p>Bank account rationalisation might also be a catalyst of sorts. Until now, corporates with a large number of accounts with multiple banking partners have been holding out for a viable multi-bank eBAM solution to arrive on the market. But companies who have been successful in consolidating their European accounts down to a small number might find that the proprietary portals already offered by a number of major cash management banks are now all that they need.</p>
<p>AkzoNobel is one company moving in this direction. With the treasury team now fully relieved of its SEPA compliance workload, introducing eBAM is next on the agenda. “A lot of documentation is required to open, close and amend bank accounts,” says AkzoNobel’s Braam. “It has always been a heavy workload for treasury, but eBAM can replace a lot of it.”</p>
<p>Another innovation that is likely to receive more attention now the SEPA end-date has passed is e-mandates. “We’ve already seen pilots in three or four European countries,” Luca Poletto, Head of SEPA, BNP Paribas Cash Management tells Treasury Today. It is, he explains, a solution that is receiving an increasing amount of consideration from his corporate clients, especially those who have migrated to SEPA Direct Debit (SDD) and have business models which require them to collect a large number of new mandates each month.</p>
<p>One final innovation that is set to receive a huge boost from SEPA is electronic invoicing. Efficient e-invoicing and processing has been on the corporate treasurer’s wish-list practically since the birth of the digital age in the 1990s. Although adoption of such solutions offers a great means for companies to improve working capital and supply chain finance processes, uptake to date has been hampered by a combination of legal uncertainty and the absence of common pan-European standards.</p>
<p>According to figures published by the European Commission in June 2013, e-invoicing accounted for only 4-15% of all invoices exchanged in Europe.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some industry experts are convinced that SEPA represents not just a transformation in the European payments market, but also the catalyst for an even bigger, global drive towards greater efficiency in payments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those hindrances are less relevant now given that the industry has defined an XML format for e-invoicing based on exactly the same data elements as SEPA XML. Consequently, experts believe companies in Europe will make a big push towards e-invoicing in the years ahead. “SEPA XML is all about payments,” says Ad van der Poel, Head of Payments and Receivables, Global Transaction Services, EMEA, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. If e-invoicing and SEPA Direct Debit together with an XML theme does finally begin to take off now, he adds, it would represent a big step towards the ultimate goal of automation across the value chain. “It is practically the final piece of the jigsaw to open the door for having XML integration.”</p>
<p>Results from Treasury Today’s 2012 and 2013 European Corporate Treasury Benchmarking studies appear to substantiate the claim that SEPA is beginning to drive greater uptake in solutions such as payments factory software, eBAM and e-invoicing.</p>
<p>In 2012, 18% of corporate treasury professionals surveyed already used payments factory software, while a further 19% stated that they planned to implement solutions in the near future. By the time of the 2013 study, those figures had increased to 24% and 27% respectively. Meanwhile, the proportion of treasurers stating that they plan to use eBAM and e-invoicing somewhere down the line rose by 5% and 9% (<a href=""#chart-1-which-of-the-following-systems-do-you-use-already-or-plan-to-use-in-the-next-12-18-months"">see Chart 1</a>).</p>

<h3 id=""beyond-europe"">Beyond Europe</h3>
<p>Elsewhere, some industry experts are convinced that SEPA represents not just a transformation in the European payments market, but also the catalyst for an even bigger, global drive towards greater efficiency in payments. Beyond the Eurozone’s periphery, interest in adopting SEPA standards has already been expressed by a number of Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) nations, notably Russia and Ukraine. These countries are currently lacking uniform payment systems and XML would seem like the most practical choice for messaging standards as they begin to develop and standardise payments infrastructure.</p>
<p>But message harmonisation in the cash management sector may, given time, stretch even further afield, perhaps even as far as the Americas or Asia. “Another area that corporates will want to explore in the coming years – brought by XML – is the possibility of extending the consolidation of payments, particularly credit transfers beyond Europe,” says BNP Paribas’ Poletto.</p>
<p>Marcus Hughes, Director of Business Development at Bottomline Technologies agrees. “That’s the big one,” he explains. But is any of this likely to be on the treasury agenda in the immediate future? Would extending the project globally not place an even larger and, more to the point, unnecessary burden on treasury resources? After all, for most corporates, SEPA migration in Europe was a difficult enough task.</p>
<p>The answer is that, as with eBAM and e-mandates, the efficiency benefits should more than justify the extra work (although this is of course easier said than done). Unlike in years past, there is also now a clear opportunity. Previously, differing national laws and regulations have meant global payments infrastructures remained fragmented. Thanks to the work that the SWIFT Common Global Implementation (CGI) initiative has put in over recent years, that could be about to change. Through the CGI initiative, over 30 banks and a handful of technology providers – including Bottomline Technologies – have collaborated to approve a suit of ISO 20020 XML standards that can be used for many different payment types, and so replacing the need for corporates to support bespoke, domestic formats.</p>
<p>Corporates in Europe who have migrated to SEPA will therefore be in a good position to explore such opportunities now. Those that do may find that, at some point down the line, they are able to reach the ultimate benchmark in cash management efficiency and transparency: a global payments factory working on behalf of all the business’s international entities. “That is exactly what XML is designed to do,” adds Hughes. “It is the logical follow on, and it really makes payment and collection factories possible, not just in the Eurozone but in other countries across the globe too.”</p>

<h5>Gerwin Braam, Senior Bank Manager and SEPA Project Manager, AkzoNobel:</h5>
<p>For the most part, the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) phase II at our company will be a continuation of the progress already made in the build-up to the deadline. At AkzoNobel we have applied a lot of effort to ensure we are ahead of the game and SEPA-compliant before the deadline.</p>
<p>One of our key goals in SEPA phase I was to connect all AkzoNobel entities to our centralised payment factory, allowing AkzoNobel to make SEPA payments on behalf of our legal entities. This was built to be SEPA-compliant and is technically ready to process XML payment files. A large majority of our legal entities are already connected to the payment factory, allowing them to process the SEPA Credit Transfer (SCT). SEPA phase II will therefore see us continue to connect the remaining entities to the payment factory – this will be completed in 2014 and will enable our payment process to be streamlined, with one credit transfer type leaving the company and only one bank file to process.</p>
<p>During phase I, we put a lot of energy into the SEPA Direct Debit (SDD) mandate. Today, we have centralised the process creating a collection factory which allows treasury to collect SDD transactions from customers’ accounts on behalf of our legal entities – a system unique to AkzoNobel. The system is technically live and the large majority of our entities, who have had to configure their own local ERP accounts payable (AP) systems, have already migrated. A key part of phase II will therefore be to continue connecting our entities to the collection factory, allowing us to harmonise and streamline the collection process. This involves replacing the legacy structure, where all entities have their own local electronic banking (e-banking) system, to a single system where collection files are sent to a central treasury system and then collected on behalf of our entities. In the long run this will allow us to gain increased visibility over the process and reduce our banking costs, as we will only have one bank contract. In addition, this should also see an increase in the number of direct debits that we have with our customers.</p>
<p>Across all our EU entities, the HR departments have already implemented SEPA-compliant salary payments. This is not something which will be extended to non-euro HR departments during phase II because these countries have their own currency that is not regarded as a SEPA currency payment and therefore do not have to comply with the SEPA standards.</p>
<figure class=""portrait left""><img alt=""Portrait of Almudena Lombardia Escudero"" height=""150"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2014/01/2014-01-tt-04-qa-almudena-lombardia-escudero-100x150.jpg"" width=""100""/></figure>
<h5>Almudena Lombardia Escudero, Treasury Administrator, Shared Service Centre (SSC), Gas Natural Fenosa:</h5>
<p>The introduction of the Single European Payment Area (SEPA) has simplified the management of Gas Natural Fenosa’s associates across Europe from its Shared Service Centre (SSC). The standardisation of files for the SEPA Credit Transfer (SCT) and SEPA Direct Debit (SDD) mean that we are truly able to talk about synergy in operations.</p>
<p>We have been able to accomplish SCT before February 2014 with the implementation of SEPA formats for most of the countries we operate in, other than Spain. Thanks to the opportunities afforded to us by our global banks we are now using XML SEPA formats sent to our entities via the internet. In this case, mass payments to suppliers are included by most of our associates, with Italy adapting to XML files in February 2014.</p>
<p>We are also waiting until February 2014 to migrate the file structure in Spain, where they will be migrated to the 34-14 format because of the Editran version installed. We will then update the Editran version in phase II before changing to XML format.</p>
<p>The migration to SDD is more complex because of the diversity of commercial interfaces and systems that support gas and electricity invoicing. Gas Natural Fenosa has recently implemented a merger process which has not yet been completed at systems level in the commercial department, and the new invoicing systems are currently in the implementation stage, meaning that both processes will overlap in time.</p>
<p>Only the SDD for Portugal and Spain are currently managed from the European SSC via non-SEPA formats. Migration to SEPA will be carried out covering the minimum necessities to guarantee operation viability. We are already working to unify physical custody of the mandates and XML files, for all of our associates, along the transition period until February 2016.</p>
<p>We are therefore expecting to finalise and complete the centralisation process in Spain, for operations by our European SEPA associates, once February 2014 arrives, for both SCT and SDD.</p>
<p>The single European payment factory will be consolidated, leaving specific residual operations for the local structure in each country, such as small cash payments, payment of charges and particular local taxes.</p>
<p>We will achieve major synergy in our European banking map thanks to the designation of global banks. This will permit simplifying the number of entities we work with in each country, so that there will be a global bank, and in some cases a local bank for specific operations, mainly SDD.</p>
<p>The processes which are currently different in each country, because of the varied equipment used, will be made uniform and unified in the SSC via centralisation. This will confer greater control and knowledge about our operations and the position of our associates beyond our frontiers.</p>
<figure class=""portrait left""><img alt=""Portrait of Gary Williams"" height=""150"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2014/01/2014-01-tt-04-qa-gary-williams-100x150.jpg"" width=""100""/></figure>
<h5>Gary Williams, General Treasury Manager, Mitsubishi Corporation International (Europe) Plc:</h5>
<p>At Mitsubishi Corporation International (Europe) Plc we have applied much effort to meet the SEPA deadline, as the project overall will give us greater efficiency. This process began around four years ago, when we became aware of the SEPA Credit Transfer (SCT), which we have since adopted and is used for around 53% of our euro payments. In addition, SEPA reduces the amount we pay in bank charges, which is quite significant as we make more than 4,000 payments per year that are eligible for SEPA.</p>
<p>With regards to SEPA phase II following the deadline, it would be ideal if we could conduct all our euro collection activity from one account, as currently we hold several accounts across Europe to collect remittances from our customers. However, we are aware that dependent upon the customer’s bank, cross border payments as opposed to in-country payments may attract a higher bank change. Despite this, we are planning to conduct some analysis on our bank account usage and ongoing requirements. We need to build up a clear picture and fully understand our customer’s position before we make any changes.</p>
<p>Another element of SEPA phase II we will be looking at is in regards to the cut-off times for making payments. The SEPA cut-off time for which payments have to be released prevents us from making certain same-day type payments and therefore we opt for the safer high value type payment option. Consequently any extension of this cut-off time in phase two would help us migrate more of our business to SEPA.</p>
<p>Although we have already adopted the SCT, we do not see SEPA Direct Debt (SDD) as constituting a large part of our phase two plans. A few of our vendors want to use SDDs and while we can accommodate, it is not something that we can apply to the collections side of our business. The primary reason for this is that our commodity trading business is based on the issuance of an invoice to collect payments.</p>
<p>SEPA certainly has been a much hyped and discussed subject for some time. The sheer volume of information surrounding the topic has often made it challenging to navigate through and ascertain clear facts. However, in terms of improving business efficiency I believe that it has certainly been worth all the effort.</p>

Making the most of the SEPA opportunity,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>SEPA was always intended to be a benefit and not a hindrance and yet the conversation leading up to the compliance deadline in February 2014 would have many believe the intentions were purely negative. Commerzbank has the view that corporates should be getting ready to enjoy the fruits of SEPA.</p>
<figure class=""portrait left""><img alt=""Portrait of Frank-Oliver Wolf, Managing Director, Commerzbank"" height=""150"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2013/11/2013-11-tt-05-bp-frank-oliver-wolf-100x150.jpg"" width=""100""/></figure>
<p>Much of the talk about SEPA over the past few years has centred on meeting the initial February 2014 deadline. However, Frank-Oliver Wolf, Managing Director, Global Head Cash Management and International Business for Commerzbank urges corporate treasurers to refrain from viewing it purely as a compliance issue. Instead it should be seen strategically, focusing energy and resources on obtaining as many benefits from the initiative as possible, creating what he refers to as a “SEPA+” strategy.</p>
<p>Essentially this means corporates should recognise opportunities to move towards payments centralisation, standardisation of accounts payable and accounts receivable processes, as well as a single technical interface in terms of all payment instruction formatting.</p>
<h3 id=""advantages-to-corporates-of-payments-standardisation"">Advantages to corporates of payments standardisation</h3>
<p>What is often overlooked by treasurers is SEPA’s potential to realise initial cost savings. For example, Wolf notes that corporates can reduce outgoings by using low-cost markets for European payment transactions. Furthermore, cross-border payments can be substituted for SEPA transactions that are priced as domestic transfers only.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, as the initiative uses largely uniformed XML ISO20022 messaging formats, treasurers will be spared the technical inflexibility, complexity and cost of having to handle a number of different file standards. Uniform settlement periods and exception processes (such as returns) for all European countries will contribute to these savings by replacing cumbersome legacy processes.</p>
<p>SEPA payments can also improve security. By only accepting an IBAN (international bank account number) as the account identifier for SEPA transactions, treasurers can be more sure that their money is transferred to the right account and that they receive payments when due.</p>
<p>Beyond the short-term cost, efficiency and security advantages, SEPA will open up expansion opportunities. “By increasing the feasibility of new trade routes powered by new payment instruments, such as SEPA Direct Debit, it encourages small and medium sized enterprises to do more cross-border business within the Eurozone,” says Wolf. For corporates already trading on a European or global scale, SEPA will allow them to consolidate their bank accounts, enabling optimised liquidity management and perhaps the establishment of payment and collection factories.</p>
<p>SEPA can also improve straight through processing levels, not least thanks to the improvements in referencing that it entails (eg. fields for end-to-end reference, originator reference and transaction reference). Wolf further argues that companies and institutions can use SEPA migration as an opportunity to optimise their cash and treasury management processes and structures “above and beyond” euro bulk payments, which are the focus of SEPA. “There are significant efficiencies that can be garnered from optimising priority payments, payments denominated in foreign currencies and third-party bank payments”.</p>
<h3 id=""key-challenges-to-sepa-adoption"">Key challenges to SEPA adoption</h3>
<p>In general, the migration to SEPA is a strategic opportunity for optimisation of processes and structures in the cash and treasury management of business groups. For a limited number of corporates – usually those only settling domestic payments, with no foreign debtors or creditors – there will be no direct strategic advantages derived from migrating to SEPA in its present form. However, these companies will benefit from a handful of functional advantages, too (eg. the new reference files).</p>
<p>These companies will also be faced with considerable implementation challenges, too. For example, sales divisions will have to revise their contractual wording in order to replace direct debit authorisations with a SEPA mandate. Accounting departments will be required to replace old account numbers and bank codes with an IBAN and a BIC (business identifier code). And IT departments will be responsible for updating their companies’ hardware and software to make sure that the more memory-intensive XML data format can be processed.</p>
<p>In these cases, the onus lies with their bank and IT-vendors to ensure that the transition is as smooth as possible. “Certainly, purely domestic-focused corporates have become used to the efficiency of national payments, which rely heavily on domestic bank identifiers, account numbers, clearing and settlement systems,” notes Wolf. “Now, from a corporate perspective, SEPA payments have to achieve the same level of efficiency including special issues such as r-transactions (refunds, returns and rejects) and investigations.”</p>
<p>In particular, the transference of domestic payment codes to SEPA codes is a key, yet daunting, task for corporates to execute, especially when they have little to gain from doing so. Tasks such as converting account numbers and bank codes into IBAN and BIC and identifying errors in their transaction administration can be especially time-consuming. Many corporates may find that their actual data error rate is higher than the percentage of rejected transactions they experience as it is common practice for banks to fix these problems when settling payments unbeknown to corporates.</p>
<h3 id=""the-need-for-action"">The need for action</h3>
<p>While corporates with global aspirations should be moving towards payments standardisation regardless of SEPA – or risk falling behind to more progressive competitors – the need for SEPA compliance has added urgency to the situation. Indeed, notes Wolf, the past few years have seen a continuing battle to catch the best resources and specialists in consultancies, vendor companies for electronic banking, enterprise resource planning (ERP) and treasury management systems (TMS), as well as experts in banks, all continue to be in high demand. Certainly, the right banking partner will be equipped to help corporates assess their existing operations against the new regulatory requirements and create the scope of their SEPA planning, but the speed of migration is also crucial.</p>
<p>Corporates should complete the remainder of the journey as quickly as possible in order to avoid maintaining two separate sets of data in parallel. Given the limited banking resources available in the market to help with the migration, the time for corporates to act is now.</p>
<h3 id=""the-sushi-principle-sepa-solution-components-for-companies"">The sushi principle – SEPA solution components for companies</h3>
<p>Quick solutions are called for but companies should also contemplate what their “emergency solutions” might look like should their migration projects not meet the deadline. “When a company is looking for external support for their in-house SEPA project, their first port of call should be their primary bank,” suggests Wolf. Indeed, he acknowledges that many banks provide support not only in the form of advice, but also through rigorous test and migration services. “This brings to mind the image of a sushi conveyor belt, where the best solution components can be hand-picked from the wide selection on offer to meet individual requirements.”</p>
<h3 id=""wide-variety-to-choose-from"">Wide variety to choose from</h3>
<p>Using the ‘sushi belt’ analogy, the conversion of account master data is the hosomaki among the solution components. This is when local account numbers and bank codes are converted into IBAN and BIC. Depending on the bank offering, multiple countries may be supported.</p>
<p>As you work your way down the sushi menu, the next item is the more intricate futomaki, which equates to the validation of account data. As part of this process, banks check the debtor and creditor account master data stored in the systems of their clients to make sure they are valid. This helps avoid r-transactions and incorrect bookings, which need to be rectified for the submitting party not only in the case of transfers, but also in the case of direct debits – “a time-consuming and costly procedure”, Wolf notes.</p>
<p>Sushi aficionados know that temaki offers a very special taste experience. Within the context of the SEPA test and migration service, this is the equivalent of the account information test data used to check whether in-house systems are compatible with SEPA. To do this, banks provide test files that contain diverse SEPA transactions. “In an ideal scenario, the files are created using account master data that are as realistic as possible so as to enable production-like downstream processing tests,” explains Wolf.</p>
<p>Almost the polar opposite of temaki is gunkan maki, which in SEPA terms makes it possible to check test files relating to payment orders. “It has proven worthwhile to arrange test file transfers with the bank before SEPA payment orders are transmitted for the first time,” says Wolf. “Ideally the bank will send back a meaningful and understandable protocol so that any necessary changes can be made as quickly as possible.”</p>
<p>For companies faced with the challenge of converting existing direct debit mandates into SEPA direct debits, the nigiri among the solution components could provide a special indulgence; ultimately the submitting party has to send the payer a one-off notification before the first SEPA direct debit is executed. Here, too, banks can provide support in the form of individual solutions where appropriate.</p>
<h3 id=""the-sashimi-solution-format-conversion"">The sashimi solution: format conversion</h3>
<p>In spite of the best possible preparations, should the SEPA project not be finalised by the SEPA cut-off date, banks can offer “emergency solutions” where required. “Even if the thought of this speciality may appear particularly appetising to some, the company’s top priority should nevertheless remain an on-time migration,” Wolf advises. Ultimately conversion solutions may prove only a fleeting indulgence, because sooner or later a “real” migration will be necessary. In addition, conversion solutions require some effort in terms of implementation and should therefore be planned with ample lead times. “At the end of the day, it is all about buying time – something that, returning to our sushi analogy, unnecessarily delays the enjoyment of the typical post-sushi dessert, daifuku.”</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>With less than six months to go before the migration deadline for the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), Guy Pantall, Head of Product, Cash Management and Payments, Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, outlines the immediate impact of 1<sup>st</sup> February 2014 and how Lloyds Bank is helping its corporate clients find the opportunities presented by SEPA to create a more efficient treasury.</p>

<h4 class=""fn"">Guy Pantall</h4>
<h5 class=""title"">Head of Product, Cash Management and Payments, Transaction Banking</h5>
<img alt=""Lloyds Bank"" class=""logo org"" height=""20"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/lloyds-bank-logo-2012-120x20.png"" width=""120""/>
<p>Guy Pantall is Head of Product for Cash Management and Payments at Lloyds. He recently joined the group from J.P. Morgan (JPM), where he had worked in a variety of international cash management roles. Previously, Pantall held positions at Barclays and Citi, and has spent the majority of his career in the treasury management discipline.</p>

<p>With 1<sup>st</sup> February 2014 quickly approaching, some national bodies and banks are concerned that markets may not be ready in time for the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) migration deadline. Fuelling market uncertainty, rumours persist that some countries will not be able to convert all their legacy payment instruments by the February end-date, which will likely cause disruption to transaction processing.</p>
<p>But, in reality, the deadline is much closer than many people realise, according to Guy Pantall, Head of Product, Cash Management and Payments, Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking. The focus should be on November this year as the more accurate deadline, due to the year-end change freeze that occurs in most organisations. “Most corporates and banks will not implement IT or process changes over year-end – which is from the middle of November to the middle of January – because they are primarily focused on closing the books and can’t afford any disruption during the process.</p>
<p>“Therefore, given that the Eurozone migration date is 1<sup>st</sup> February, it will not be possible to accommodate a major implementation between mid-January and the end date because there is not enough time to perform the necessary testing. So unless these changes are implemented by November, then it is unlikely that an organisation will be ready on time.”</p>
<p>But have most corporates even started mapping out their SEPA plans? The trade press is awash with surveys and reports that paint a negative picture in terms of corporate awareness and adoption of SEPA. For example, in a PwC report released last month, one company in three remains at risk of not being ready. Some corporates who haven’t yet begun their SEPA journey are still struggling with the fundamental question of why the euro payments infrastructure has to change.</p>
<p>Similarly, the European Central Bank (ECB) migration numbers are indicative of the low level of adoption. On the slightly more positive side, the ECB indices show that just under half (46.95%) of credit transfers made in the SEPA zone are currently compliant, as of June 2013. However, conversion to SEPA Direct Debits (SDDs) is still at a remarkably low level – only 3.73% of euro direct debits are processed as SDDs.</p>

<p>What is even more worrying is the lack of preparedness of the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector. The ECB ‘traffic light’ indicators show that in the two largest Eurozone economies, France and Germany, this segment is reporting ‘red’ for credit transfer and direct debits, which means that SME preparations have not yet commenced and/or are not expected to be ready in time.</p>
<p>All of this adds up to the fact that the payments industry as a whole needs to be prepared for less than 100% take-up of SEPA by the end-date.</p>

<p>Due to the tight time constraints, many corporates are turning to third-party conversion services without directly integrating SEPA standards into their back office. “Corporates looked at their IT and business priorities and thought that by outsourcing they could check SEPA off their to-do list. Rather than creating changes in their own systems, corporates have turned to third parties to provide an intermediate step between what they have now and where they want to be,” explains Pantall. “But this goes against the spirit of SEPA, which is aimed at getting everyone to use the same ubiquitous standard.”</p>

<p>The original concept was for corporates to directly embed standard formats into their processes, not drive harmonisation through greater intermediation. It appears that this development was not anticipated when SEPA was first being mapped out, so there is no clear rule governing third parties and it remains to be seen whether future regulation will focus on these arrangements.</p>
<p>It’s also unclear what the impact of not being ready will be – there is no ‘Plan B’ if organisations don’t adhere to the end-date. “No one knows what will happen – again it wasn’t envisaged that organisations wouldn’t be ready,” says Pantall. It is quite possible that a country and its banking participants could continue to operate a legacy scheme as a sub-SEPA solution, such as the SEDA additional optional service (SEPA compliant Database Alignment) in Italy, and be willing for a time to accept the ramifications – and perhaps fines – from the EU or national bodies.</p>
<p>The result of late convergence, in conjunction with ad hoc decisions to facilitate local compliance by February 2014, risks moving the market infrastructure further away from SEPA’s standardisation and harmonisation objectives. In turn, the standards that are achieved in SEPA instruments are likely to be at a diminished feature-functionality level – the lowest common denominator – which could prove unattractive for corporates in the future.</p>
<h3 id=""the-devil-is-in-the-detail"">The devil is in the detail</h3>
<p>Adding to market confusion, many banks continue to present different interpretations of the regulation. For example, some banks insist ISO 20022 XML is mandatory for corporates, while others are keen to discuss conversion services. But for those corporates relying on banks or third-party providers for conversion services, such solutions cannot be implemented ‘overnight’ and mapping services are still dependent on the corporate’s access to core data.</p>
<p>The ‘devil’ is in the detail, and it is only when corporates examine the change effects can they fully grasp their implications, extending beyond simple IT adjustments. For example, the SDD Core scheme changes pre-notification routines, and provides for stronger consumer protection; and whilst the SDD Business-to-Business (B2B) scheme enables faster execution and limited payment revocability, it also introduces additional creditor mandate responsibilities. Banks also need to address clients with smaller scale cross-border trading relationships, or less sophisticated back office capability able to capture SEPA changes.</p>
<p>Today corporates are waking up to the fact that ‘the SEPA effect’ does not stop at an organisation’s boundaries, but touches all their counterparties – payments are fundamentally a network business. A corporate’s cash flow could be susceptible to counterparties’ delayed SEPA readiness – old-versions or in-house enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems may be incapable of accommodating SEPA data. Some corporates could be forced into unwanted or untimely system upgrades, or they could simply be on the debtor side of a SEPA direct debit collection and unaware of scheme change implications.</p>
<p>It is crucial that corporates talk to their relationship banks in order to understand how SEPA will impact their business. Although other banks will provide some perspective, only a client’s own bank is suitably informed to provide guidance and support that takes into account the client’s working capital requirements, its treasury complexity, transaction scale and volume, and risk appetite to determine optimum approach to SEPA. “And If your bank isn’t talking to you, you need to consider reaching out to a bank ready to address clients’ needs and provide its expertise such as Lloyds Bank,” says Pantall.</p>
<h3 id=""opportunities-in-the-making"">Opportunities in the making</h3>
<p>Corporates need to build a clear picture of their euro transactions, understand which need to migrate to SEPA compliance and determine the business value of SEPA to identify opportunities to transform their euro cash management function. “The best opportunities of SEPA are being overlooked in the need to ensure compliance,” according to Pantall.</p>
<p>SEPA’s aim is to create a level playing field in the euro payments market, enabling faster, cheaper and safer payments processing with cross-border transactions aligning to domestic payments. ‘Free choice of EU location of an account with Europe-wide reach’ is a hugely significant aspect of the regulation. It will allow businesses to locate financial activities in their financial centre of choice and to rationalise bank providers and account structures.</p>
<p>Clients can capture centralisation benefits through deployment of payments-on-behalf-of (POBO) and collections-on-behalf-of (COBO) shared services as a result of SEPA feature functionality. Although payables transformation is considered to be relatively straightforward, meeting SEPA compliance in receivables given many small cross-border issues and transitioning to centralised COBO processing is much more challenging – none more so in business models where the offer to the consumer is directly linked to bill payment via direct debit.</p>
<p>“SEPA offers an opportunity to our clients to re-evaluate cash management across Europe as the traditional need to rely on local banks and local accounts is reduced,” says Pantall. How quickly corporates can take full advantage of SEPA, and how much value can be derived, is conditioned by the significance of non-SEPA money transmission in their ledgers, agility of ERP systems and treasury management systems (TMS), and the risk/reward profile of centralisation opportunities, including its corporate structure and culture.</p>
<p>It could take time for less sophisticated corporates that have achieved ‘late’ compliance to stabilise back office processes and leverage cash management and payments transformation opportunities, particularly those that have implemented alternative, local scheme solutions demanding continued access to Eurozone country accounts.</p>
<p>Corporates aiming to seize the opportunities created by SEPA must equally be aware of the implications on internal change capacity impacting systems, costs, resources and buyer/seller relationships, which require careful planning and controlled implementation methodology.</p>
<p>“‘Phase 1’ of SEPA implementation should be execution focused, with no or minimal disruption to business continuity, whereas ‘Phase 2’ could be considered a next step to pursue post-compliance benefits,” says Pantall.</p>
<h3 id=""impact-on-uk-companies"">Impact on UK companies</h3>
<p>The effects of SEPA exceed the Eurozone – 51% of UK trade overseas is with Europe. By embracing SEPA, UK businesses will benefit from the standardisation across Europe.</p>

<p>However, with most of the SEPA messaging coming from European banks focused on the 2014 deadline, many corporates will not have had a conversation about the latter deadline of 31<sup>st</sup> October 2016, for those holding accounts outside the Eurozone. This is one reason why SEPA is not high on the corporate agenda in the UK.</p>
<p>The UK market view risks “polarisation” between the 2014 and 2016 end dates, according to Pantall. “Effectively, the UK is already participant in a SEPA continuum, with sterling-base corporates at varying stages of SEPA readiness. Those corporates with a high focus on euro working capital, higher time and interest commitment with dedicated resources allocated to SEPA transformation, and higher competitive leverage with their banks are likely to render the 2014 end date as a demand-led date for SEPA convergence,” he explains.</p>
<p>Hence, Pantall advises clients of non-Eurozone banks to focus on the immediate impacts of February 2014, whereas he sees the 2016 deadline as a lesser event with fewer legacy issues to resolve. However, insight from some of Lloyds Bank’s larger corporate clients highlights that there is still much confusion in the market about what the impacts and opportunities are, as they are being presented in different ways by the various banks. The key consideration for UK businesses is where their bank accounts are domiciled. It is the location of these accounts – and not the company location – that determines the relevant deadline.</p>
<p>“UK corporates may not be aware of the impacts and opportunities of SEPA, mainly because they have more pressing things to worry about,” says Pantall. “However, if a corporate holds accounts both in and out of the Eurozone, will it make the change for just some of its accounts? Very unlikely. Corporates should look to convert everything at once.”</p>
<p>Across the board, technical compliance must be achieved by October 2016 and few commentators would bet against a low state of readiness in jurisdictions outside the Eurozone as that date approaches. Clearly, much depends on multiple and diverse economic conditions in the interim, although the Eurozone provides a strong frame of reference for banks outside it to drive a more seamless changeover and de-risk SEPA compliance.</p>
<h3 id=""back-to-basics"">Back to basics</h3>
<p>SEPA will happen, and in time corporates will see an end to SEPA-themed events and material. The real story behind the initiative is about making the euro work for business and consumers. The UK trade with Europe is vast and Lloyds Bank is committed to supporting its clients operating in euro.</p>
<p>“Our aim is to set out the facts around SEPA and be clear about what the opportunities are for our clients, what our SEPA products are, the options clients have to locate financial activities in their financial centre of choice, rationalise bank providers and account structures, and create efficiencies more closely aligned to their treasury organisation and working capital structures,” says Pantall.</p>
<p>The bank has positioned itself to address the needs of clients of all sizes, including the middle market segment, which has been overlooked by most banks to date. “A lot of the SEPA conversations have been dominated by the big guys, but we are looking forward to having more engagement with our mid-cap customers to give them the support they need.”</p>
<p>Lloyds Bank is a natural banking partner in Europe – located in a non-euro country, euro is its second currency and the bank can offer centralised liquidity management using SEPA as “the reach” for transaction management across the region. “In terms of a consolidated one-stop shop, we fit very well. Conditions around bank accounts and liquidity structures are very favourable in the UK, and Lloyds Bank has ubiquitous reach for processing,” explains Pantall. “In order to appeal to our clients, we have joined up our SEPA offerings with Trade and Card to present broader capabilities in the form of solutions, which address the needs defined by our clients.” The bank has partner bank arrangements on the ground in Europe for clients who want to extend beyond the classic centralised payables and receivables model for services delivered locally.</p>
<p>And most importantly, Lloyds Bank puts its client at the centre of the product management discipline. “We are cognisant that clients do not buy products; they need solutions across all their transaction banking and commercial banking needs,” Pantall concludes.</p>

",,,2013-09-01,Regulation Compliance,False
Taking different roads,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>In 2009, the G20 leaders agreed to take a number of co-ordinated measures to guard against future systemic risks in the financial system. Since then, the highly complex network of bodies that govern the different parts of the financial system have gone into overdrive, and the result has been a deluge of financial regulation across the globe.</p>
<p>Under the weight of this regulatory onslaught, it is not surprising that financial institutions, and those that use their services, have complained that they are suffering from regulatory fatigue. A recent survey of the UK financial services sector, commissioned by Moorhouse Consulting, found that approximately 40% of financial services institutions are not coping with the volume of regulatory change, even though two in every five projects initiated concerns with regulatory compliance. Furthermore, this volume is preventing 88% of organisations from proactively addressing other business priorities.</p>
<p>It is not just the speed with which the regulatory landscape is changing that is causing this lethargy, but also the way in which regulation is diverging across jurisdictions. Undoubtedly, there are broad similarities between the various frameworks adopted in the EU and US, but a number of significant differences have appeared.</p>
<h3 id=""basel-iii"">Basel III</h3>
<p>In the case of Basel III, the point of divergence has occurred as the regulation has been transposed into national law. In some cases, national regulators have sought to bolster Basel’s minimum requirements – the US regulators’, for example, recently proposed to double the original leverage requirement. In other instances, implementation has been fast-tracked, leading to a situation whereby some countries are well ahead of schedule and while a handful have made little or no progress.</p>

<p>“If you contrast the approaches of Europe and the US, you can clearly see that the substance of the regulation varies to different degrees,” says Ruth Wandhöfer, Global Head of Regulatory and Market Strategy at Citi. “Interestingly the US has not yet proposed the liquidity rules, which were planned to come into effect by 2015. Instead, they have pressed ahead with a modified proposal for a Leverage Coverage Ratio (LCR), whilst Europe has maintained the Basel III approach thus far and refrained from setting firm deadlines for compliance as of yet.” The upshot of all this is that one ends up in a very different place on the balance sheet, adds Wandhöfer – and that’s even before beginning to factor in the different accounting regimes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Approximately 40% of financial services institutions are not coping with the volume of regulatory change, even though two in every five projects initiated concerns with regulatory compliance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Structural bank reforms are another example of how the US and Europe are moving in different directions. Earlier this year, research published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) claimed that “potentially significant global costs” could result if systemically important banks are forced to simultaneously comply with the Volker rule in the US, the Liikanen proposals in Europe and the Vickers report in the UK. The combined impact of materially different rules may force institutions to move to the highest common denominator, the report argues, leading to higher costs than would be incurred through compliance with any of the measures in isolation.</p>
<h3 id=""otc-derivatives"">OTC derivatives</h3>
<p>In addition to banking regulations, there is the reform of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. In the US, one of the aims of the sprawling Dodd-Frank Act, enacted by US Congress in 2010, was to minimise the systemic risks associated with derivatives trading and increase transparency by requiring market participants to clear their trades and report more information about them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2010, a survey of 500 senior executives in the financial services industry undertaken by Ernst and Young found that a majority (79%) felt that much more needed to be done to harmonise financial regulation at a global level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Across the pond, the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) has many commonalities with Dodd-Frank, but there are also significant differences. For non-financial corporates, the most relevant disparity concerns the reporting requirements. EMIR requires mandatory reporting of both OTC derivatives and exchange-traded derivatives; whereas Dodd-Frank, by contrast, only requires OTC derivatives to be reported. EMIR is also less flexible compared with Dodd-Frank in that requires both counterparties to report a trade, while only one side needs to report under Dodd-Frank.</p>
<p>“In 2009, the G20 decided that they want to have enforced central clearing of OTC derivatives,” says Alexandra Foster, Global Head of Strategy and Business Development at BT. “But what we have now is one interpretation of that by Dodd-Frank and another interpretation by EMIR. As a result of this, we are going to see a differing impact upon different parts of the financial ecosystem.” It will create a legal minefield for a financial institution or corporate operating across borders, she explains. “Now an organisation has to work out whether it is operating according to home rules, or to the rules of the jurisdiction they are in.”</p>
<p>Wandhöfer agrees with Foster that differences between the EU and the US on derivatives reform had initially left everyone in the industry confused about what rules they were to follow. “Although the EU Commission and the US Treasury recently announced they will be working together to align aspects of the derivatives trade regulation, at first they were focusing on their own developments, which were not aligned with each other,” says Wandhöfer. “That left cross-border institutions like us in legal limbo as it was unclear whether a cross-border OTC derivative trade might land us in jail because of the conflicting EU and US regimes.”</p>
<h5 id=""time-to-get-together"">Time to get together</h5>
<p>None of these concerns are especially new. In 2010, a survey of 500 senior executives in the financial services industry undertaken by Ernst and Young found that a majority (79%) felt that much more needed to be done to harmonise financial regulation at a global level.</p>
<p>Nick Voisey, Director at the Loan Market Association (LMA), says this is also a point his organisation have been endeavouring to make to the regulators for some time now. “One has to remember just how interconnected the global regulatory and financial environment really is,” he explains. “Of course realistically, countries – given their various economic, political and social priorities – are going to implement things in slightly different ways and within different timeframes. But we now have numerous regulatory proposals on the table, and no one at a high enough level has sat down and looked at the impact of them all together and how they will affect the wider European and global economy.”</p>
<p>Many have placed a lot of confidence in the trade talks between the US and EU, which began in July 2013, hoping that politicians on both sides would seize the opportunity and begin doing exactly that. “The financial sector has been strongly advocating for the inclusion of financial services into the transatlantic trade pact,” says Wandhöfer. US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew recently poured cold water on this prospect, citing concerns that the inclusion of financial services in the trade talks might end with the Dodd-Frank Act being watered down. But to the contrary, Wandhöfer thinks that such a discussion should not be about resolving all the differences between Dodd-Frank and EMIR or the Volker Rule and Liikanen, but instead it should establish a structure for co-operation between the two jurisdictions going forward. “If we establish a framework for co-operation in this trade round between Europe and the US, we can make sure that in the future when we propose laws that we inform each other ahead of time,” she reasons.</p>
<h5 id=""navigating-the-changing-regulatory-landscape"">Navigating the changing regulatory landscape</h5>
<p>“I think we are now in a constantly changing regulatory world, and it looks like that will continue,” says BT’s Foster. In this brave new world, she thinks that corporates will need to adopt a more flexible and strategic approach to issues relating to regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>Often, organisations choose to adopt a step-by-step approach to compliance, but Foster thinks that taking a longer-term view is what organisations now need to be taking to help them to adapt to regulatory changes, both now and in the future. “By having that flexible, adaptive approach means that you will be covered for any eventuality. There are underlying themes to all these regulatory changes we’ve seen recently – Basel, Dodd-Frank, EMIR – and once you’ve considered those you can be more confident about planning your roll-out than you would be,” she says. “It is about trying to become more proactive with your compliance strategy and less reactive.”</p>

<h3 id=""getting-ready-for-emir"">Getting ready for EMIR</h3>
<p>“As mandatory reporting for both OTC and listed derivatives becomes a reality in Europe, banks, corporates and other buy-side firms need to think carefully about their obligations to their regulators,” says Andrew Green, Global Head of Account Management at the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC).</p>
<p>Unlike the Dodd-Frank Act, where the reporting obligation rests primarily with derivatives dealers, obligation to report rests both parties to the trade with EMIR. “It is important therefore that all parties understand their reporting requirements and the options available to them,” says Green. “This includes reporting directly to a trade repository, or utilising a third party or the counterparty to report on their behalf. Regulators, dealers and trade repositories themselves are a good source for this type of information.”</p>
<p>EMIR has certainly become a growing concern for corporates in the past year. According to a survey by Chatham Financial published in May 2013, a majority of derivatives end-users facing compliance requirements under EMIR are not yet ready to meet their key obligations. Among a sample of 177 companies, approximately 66 (44%) stated that they were unsure of their status under EMIR, while 111 (74%) said they are not yet fully prepared for the transition.</p>
<p>The results appear to correspond with the message the banks are hearing from their corporate clients. “The clients we talk to are now feeling quite comfortable with Basel,” says Per-Magnus Edh, Client Executive, Head of Global Financial Solutions, FI Coverage, SEB Merchant Banking. “What they are concerned about right now is EMIR.”</p>
<p>Edh expects that companies with little intragroup trading will outsource their reporting to their banking partners. However, Carlo Scotto, a Senior Product Specialist at SuperDerivatives, cannot envisage the banks providing this service without charge. “The bank will not offer it for free,” he says, “so smaller treasury operations which lack the resources required to handle the execution and management of collateral themselves will need to rethink how much budget the hedging team will need.”</p>
<p>For parent companies reporting on behalf of numerous subsidiaries meeting the requirements under EMIR will inevitably be an even more complex task. These companies will not only need to maintain relationships with their existing brokers, but will also need to develop relationships with the yet-to-be-named trade repositories.</p>
<p>So, what steps do these types of companies need to take between now and the 2014 deadline, and where can they ask for help? One of the ways consultants can assist is by carrying out an assessment of the current infrastructure and using that to design a target operating model, says Scotto. “These activities are generally run by big consulting firms who will advise corporations on how to move from one point to another and how to change the business model so that they have a clear picture of what gaps need to be filled before the regulator comes in to check what is missing.”</p>

Taxing times in Asia,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>According to the 2013 World Bank ‘Doing Business’ report, central Asia recorded the biggest improvement in terms of time required to comply with profit, labour and consumption taxes of any region worldwide over the last eight years.</p>
<p>However, the Asia Business Outlook Survey conducted by the Economist Corporate Network in December 2012 underlines the disparity within tax policy across the region. The survey found that tax rates were a ‘major issue’ for just 10% of Asian multinationals with a regional headquarters in Singapore or Hong Kong, whereas one-third of those headquartered in Tokyo, 25% in Shanghai and 18% in Kuala Lumpur described tax rates as a negative factor.</p>
<p>These findings are largely reflected in the World Bank report, which ranks Hong Kong and Singapore as the fourth and fifth easiest places in the world to pay tax based on the number of payments, time and total tax rates. Japan, on the other hand, was the only Asian country to introduce new taxes in 2011/12 (although it also cut its corporate income tax rate).</p>

<p>Differing tax rates are not the only challenge facing corporate treasurers in Asia. Efficient tax planning depends on clarity, but this is often undermined by the practice of granting tax concessions to multinational companies (MNCs) on an ad hoc basis without clear guidance that could be used by other companies to seek similar concessions.</p>
<p>The fact that some countries fail to distinguish between revenue and capital when it comes to taxation is a further obstacle to a consistent regional treasury approach.</p>
<p>The dominant regional economies have been among the most proactive when it comes to reviewing and refining tax policy. For example, China’s State Administration of Taxation (SAT) recently clarified that as part of its value-added tax (VAT) pilot study, VAT should be excluded from taxable income such as dividends, bonuses and royalty fees derived by non-resident enterprises.</p>
<p>The announcement concerning the corporate income tax treatment for such enterprises specifically addresses income originating from China and earned by non-resident enterprises with no in-country presence, or enterprises with an establishment in the country but obtaining income that has no actual connection with that entity.</p>
<h3 id=""australian-developments"">Australian developments</h3>
<p>One of the key developments in Australia in recent years has been the introduction of Taxation of Financial Arrangements (TOFA) in 2009, which seeks to align tax and accounting outcomes for financial instruments. Paul Travers, President of the Finance and Treasury Association (Australia) and Executive Director of Oakvale Treasury, describes TOFA as a useful initiative since it mitigates the work to be done on valuations and settlements.</p>
<p>“Additionally, it has allowed hedge accounting principles to also be applied to tax by, for example, being able to apply effectiveness testing (for hedge accounting) to both areas. This helps align tax and accounting outcomes, although it is not a decrease to the burden as this type of testing was not previously required for tax.”</p>
<p>He believes this topic will become more of a focus for Australian treasurers looking to establish effective cash facilities in Asia. “The Asia capital markets are being increasingly discussed as a potential source of capital, with some corporations tapping the bond markets and having Asian banks join their banking syndicates.”</p>
<p>In early April, the Australian government published proposals that Assistant Treasurer David Bradbury said should help discourage aggressive tax minimisation practices by large corporate entities. The most significant proposed change (which would take effect from the 2013-14 tax year) is the publication of limited tax return information relating to businesses with a total income of AUD100m or more, including reported total income, taxable income and income tax payable. In recent months, the Australian government has also updated the transfer pricing rules contained in domestic law to bring them closer to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) standards.</p>
<h3 id=""asian-complexity"">Asian complexity</h3>
<p>Governments across Asia have been particularly active on transfer pricing in an attempt to make sure companies leave a ‘fair share’ of their profit behind, explains Alf Capito, Tax Policy Leader Asia Pacific, Ernst &amp; Young (E&amp;Y).</p>
<p>“The Philippines recently promulgated transfer pricing guidelines and even set a profit benchmark, and Indonesia has taken similar steps to make it harder for MNCs to charge management fees and royalties. The burden on reporting transfer pricing has become greater because more documentation is required and tax authorities also want to see the substance of what the company is doing. Corporate treasurers need to keep an eye on this issue because their tax base could be exposed to penalties and adjustments if they are not careful.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Treasurers across the region would benefit from co-ordinated lobbying of governments on tax policy issues.”</p>
<p><cite>Delores Goh, Head of Tax in Asia Pacific, Jones Lang LaSalle</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>General anti-avoidance rules (GAAR) are also a hot topic, adds Capito. “China has had GAAR for a while but is now framing legislation for how such rules will be enforced. About two-thirds of countries in the region either have GAAR or are planning to introduce them.”</p>
<p>David Smith, Senior Advisor, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), refers to efforts to counter ‘treaty shopping’ leading to increasing challenges and disputes in relation to structures long used by Asian groups to hold investments in other countries. “At the same time, the OECD’s work in areas such as the meaning of ‘permanent establishment’ and ‘beneficial ownership’ for tax treaty purposes is also calling into doubt the viability of such structures. When all of these matters are taken together, there is little doubt that the management of taxes in Asia has become more complex over the last 12 months.”</p>
<p>Dezan Shira &amp; Associates provides tax advice to foreign direct investors across Asia. Chris Devonshire-Ellis, Principal and Founding Partner of its Singapore office, says the unharmonised nature of the region means reform of tax regulations has been patchy and that the pace of change has slowed over the past five years due to uncertainties caused by the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>“Financial uncertainty is not a friend of liberal tax reform,” he says, referring to Vietnam as one of the most assertive Asian nations in this respect over the last 12 months. “Vietnam has been taking the lead in aggressively targeting China in terms of reducing tax levels for attracting light manufacturing from south China in particular. Tax breaks and rates in Vietnam are two points lower than in China now as a result.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, India has been particularly haphazard when considering corporate tax reforms, he suggests. “New tax laws and regulations generally don’t increase the financial and compliance burden on companies – the overall desire has been to find ways to lessen the tax burden and stimulate foreign investment. But while the intent may be there, much has yet to be done to see that actually realised in policy, with India being a prime example.”</p>
<p>However, changes are afoot in the world’s second most populous nation. In late February, India’s Finance Minister presented a budget that included several notable proposals, including introducing the country’s GAAR from April 2015 and increasing tax rates applicable to business income of foreign companies above certain thresholds and to royalties and fees for technical services paid to non-residents.</p>
<p>These proposals are expected to be enacted by June 2013 and would see the effective tax rate on income of a foreign company from India (where total income exceeds INR100m) increase from 42.02% to 43.26%, while the tax rate on royalties and fees for technical services paid to non-residents would rise from 10% to 25%. A proposal that a tax residency certificate alone would not suffice for a non-resident entity to claim a tax treaty benefit was subsequently dropped.</p>
<p>Devonshire-Ellis describes the eventual enactment of India’s tax reforms as a game changer that will affect all Asian foreign direct investment (FDI), impact on China and alter the global supply chain. “These changes will have the effect of significantly reducing both corporate and individual income tax levels and combined with its young and relatively inexpensive workforce, will shift export manufacturing from China to the sub-continent. India will finally lift off as an investment destination to rival what we have seen from China over the past 20 years.”</p>
<h3 id=""potential-for-greater-harmonisation"">Potential for greater harmonisation?</h3>
<p>Delores Goh is Head of Tax in Asia Pacific for global real estate services firm Jones Lang LaSalle. She agrees with the view expressed in the latest World Bank ‘Doing Business’ report that the regulatory environment for corporate enterprises in many Asian economies has generally become more sympathetic over the last decade.</p>
<p>“We have seen tax authorities trying to make filing and compliance easier for businesses by introducing e-filing, simplifying tax forms and using self-service e-tax certificates. However, the transfer pricing regime in most countries has intensified and audit, filing and documentation requirements have increased tremendously, putting a greater burden on the cost of doing business.”</p>
<p>Goh expects closer co-ordination and co-operation in the area of tax administration among Asian economies over the next few years. “We know of many tax authorities sharing information today and most tax treaties include clauses for the exchange of information across tax regimes.” Goh believes treasurers across the region would benefit from co-ordinated lobbying of governments on tax policy issues.</p>
<p>But she also admits that it would be difficult to find a company or treasurer who would be prepared to lead such an initiative and that in any case, persuading governments to set aside rivalries would be massively difficult. “Given that Asian economies are so different, it would be very challenging – not impossible, but a very long shot.”</p>
<p>Lattice and speciality emulsion polymer supplier Synthomer’s Group Finance Director David Blackwood relates a similar experience. Most of the company’s Asian business is done in Malaysia, where he says the company has found authorities across all aspects of regulation to be very business friendly and flexible and generally keen to support the business.</p>
<p>“The only substantial tax change in Malaysia recently has been around new transfer pricing regulations, which is right since most jurisdictions have transfer pricing rules. We are yet to see the application of these rules, but I would expect them to be applied in a balanced way based on previous experiences.”</p>
<p>However, Blackwood shares Goh’s doubts about whether tax laws and regulations across Asian countries could ever be harmonised, although he acknowledges that such a move would make life a lot easier.</p>
<p>Corporate compliance will remain an issue in Asia for some time as tax collection mechanisms lag behind policy, believes Devonshire-Ellis. “The simplification of tax regimes is more to stimulate growth than address collection issues. There will be closer co-ordination and co-operation in the area of tax administration among Asian economies over the next few years, but the objective will be to lessen overall tax burdens and specifically intra-Asian customs tariffs.”</p>
<p>The rise of Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) will create a massive free trade area across Asia, and the co-ordination of bilateral and multilateral double taxation agreements (DTAs) will pave the way for sustainable regional growth for the next 20-30 years, he adds.</p>
<p>“ASEAN’s agreements are already doing away with much of the customs duties, but I think the Asian harmonisation of corporate or individual income taxes will remain off the agenda for years. Asia is so diverse that I don’t think, apart from easing trade, we will see any collusion on sovereign tax or other matters.”</p>
<p>Tim Owen, an Independent Corporate Treasury Consultant and former Director of Treasury at Cadbury Schweppes, also doubts that Asian economies will produce any sort of harmonised approach to corporate tax.</p>
<p>“Certainly in India, whilst there have been moves to be more tax-friendly towards MNCs (for example the liberalisation of 100% foreign ownership around the turn of the millennium) there is still some way to go, as exemplified by the problems that MNCs such as Vodafone have had recently. This seems to me to involve the levying of income taxes on capital transactions, which is a very different approach from the rest of the world. The struggle of foreign retailers to get access to the Indian market is another example.”</p>
<p>Singapore-based Managing Director of Acarate and former Vice President of Treasury at Chinese telecommunications equipment maker Huawei, David Blair, says India’s recent claims that several MNCs (including Vodafone) failed to properly value transactions with their Indian subsidiaries is evidence of a more aggressive and sophisticated approach to corporate taxation.</p>
<p>He believes Asian treasurers are “very passive” on issues that affect their functions and would benefit from co-ordinated lobbying of regional governments.</p>
<h3 id=""adapting-to-change"">Adapting to change</h3>
<p>In order to take advantage of reforms in China and India, treasurers need to move quickly to evaluate treasury management changes and provide optimal structures and processes. That is the view of Gourang Shah, Head of Treasury Advisory, Asia Pacific Treasury and Trade Solutions at Citi, who recommends optimising funding options for investments in India and integrating renminbi (RMB) into group-wide cash and liquidity management structures.</p>
<p>The latest benchmarking survey from Citi Treasury Diagnostics found that a high percentage of Asian MNCs are failing to leverage technology, accounting for just 10% of all companies using SWIFT worldwide. The large number of Japanese corporates still using in-house spreadsheets or databases rather than treasury management systems (TMS) is a legacy of the fact that they didn’t historically manage global treasury operations from the headquarters, explains Shah.</p>
<p>“As MNCs from other parts of Asia globalise and their business scale increases, they will need to be more efficient in terms of treasury management. That will require them to centralise and TMS will be needed to support centralised treasury management. Some have already started licensing and implementing solutions.”</p>

<h3 id=""favourable-locations-for-rtcs-singapore-and-malaysia"">Favourable locations for RTCs: Singapore and Malaysia</h3>
<p>Setting up a regional treasury centre in a location with a favourable tax and/or regulatory environment is an option for achieving a more tax efficient treasury solution. Several Asian countries, such as Malaysia and Singapore, offer specific incentives to locate such centres in their jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Malaysia provides a range of incentives to companies to establish their treasury functions within the country, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Income tax exemption of 70% of statutory income from qualifying treasury services rendered to related companies for five years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Withholding tax exemption on interest payments on borrowings from overseas used for qualifying activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stamp duty exemption on loan and service agreements for qualifying activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expatriates working in the treasury management centre taxed only on the portion of their chargeable income attributable to the number of days they are in Malaysia.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>MNCs who establish a finance and treasury centre in Singapore can avail themselves of tax rates of 5% or 10% for five or ten years (with possible extension) on qualifying income, which includes fee income received from related companies, offices and associates outside Singapore for the provision of qualifying services, as well as interest, dividends and gains earned from qualifying activities.</p>
<p>Providing they incur significant local business spending, employ a team of professional staff and provide qualifying services to approved network companies, these companies can also qualify for an exemption on withholding tax.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>According to the 2013 World Bank ‘Doing Business’ report, central Asia recorded the biggest improvement in terms of time required to comply with profit, labour and consumption taxes of any region worldwide over the last eight years.</p>
<p>However, the Asia Business Outlook Survey conducted by the Economist Corporate Network in December 2012 underlines the disparity within tax policy across the region. The survey found that tax rates were a ‘major issue’ for just 10% of Asian multinationals with a regional headquarters in Singapore or Hong Kong, whereas one third of those headquartered in Tokyo, 25% in Shanghai and 18% in Kuala Lumpur described tax rates as a negative factor.</p>
<p>These findings are largely reflected in the World Bank report, which ranks Hong Kong and Singapore as the fourth and fifth easiest places in the world to pay tax based on the number of payments, time and total tax rates. Japan, on the other hand, was the only Asian country to introduce new taxes in 2011/12 (although it also cut its corporate income tax rate).</p>

<p>Differing tax rates are not the only challenge facing corporate treasurers in Asia. Efficient tax planning depends on clarity, but this is often undermined by the practice of granting tax concessions to multinational companies (MNCs) on an ad hoc basis without clear guidance that could be used by other companies to seek similar concessions.</p>
<p>The fact that some countries fail to distinguish between revenue and capital when it comes to taxation is a further obstacle to a consistent regional treasury approach.</p>
<p>The dominant regional economies have been among the most proactive when it comes to reviewing and refining tax policy. For example, China’s State Administration of Taxation (SAT) recently clarified that as part of its value-added tax (VAT) pilot study, VAT should be excluded from taxable income such as dividends, bonuses and royalty fees derived by non-resident enterprises.</p>
<p>The announcement concerning the corporate income tax treatment for such enterprises specifically addresses income originating from China and earned by non-resident enterprises with no in-country presence, or enterprises with an establishment in the country but obtaining income that has no actual connection with that entity.</p>
<h3 id=""australian-developments"">Australian developments</h3>
<p>One of the key developments in Australia in recent years has been the introduction of Taxation of Financial Arrangements (TOFA) in 2009, which seeks to align tax and accounting outcomes for financial instruments. Paul Travers, President of the Finance and Treasury Association (Australia) and Executive Director of Oakvale Treasury, describes TOFA as a useful initiative since it mitigates the work to be done on valuations and settlements.</p>
<p>“Additionally, it has allowed hedge accounting principles to also be applied to tax by, for example, being able to apply effectiveness testing (for hedge accounting) to both areas. This helps align tax and accounting outcomes, although it is not a decrease to the burden as this type of testing was not previously required for tax.”</p>
<p>He believes this topic will become more of a focus for Australian treasurers looking to establish effective cash facilities in Asia. “The Asia capital markets are being increasingly discussed as a potential source of capital, with some corporations tapping the bond markets and having Asian banks join their banking syndicates.”</p>
<p>In early April, the Australian government published proposals that Assistant Treasurer David Bradbury said should help discourage aggressive tax minimisation practices by large corporate entities. The most significant proposed change (which would take effect from the 2013-14 tax year) is the publication of limited tax return information relating to businesses with a total income of AUD100m or more, including reported total income, taxable income and income tax payable. In recent months, the Australian government has also updated the transfer pricing rules contained in domestic law to bring them closer to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) standards.</p>
<h3 id=""asian-complexity"">Asian complexity</h3>
<p>Governments across Asia have been particularly active on transfer pricing in an attempt to make sure companies leave a ‘fair share’ of their profit behind, explains Alf Capito, Tax Policy Leader Asia Pacific Ernst &amp; Young (E&amp;Y).</p>
<p>“The Philippines recently promulgated transfer pricing guidelines and even set a profit benchmark, and Indonesia has taken similar steps to make it harder for MNCs to charge management fees and royalties. The burden on reporting transfer pricing has become greater because more documentation is required and tax authorities also want to see the substance of what the company is doing. Corporate treasurers need to keep an eye on this issue because their tax base could be exposed to penalties and adjustments if they are not careful.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Treasurers across the region would benefit from co-ordinated lobbying of governments on tax policy issues.”</p>
<p><cite>Delores Goh, Head of Tax in Asia Pacific, Jones Lang LaSalle</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>General anti-avoidance rules (GAAR) are also a hot topic, adds Capito. “China has had GAAR for a while but is now framing legislation for how such rules will be enforced. About two-thirds of countries in the region either have GAAR or are planning to introduce them.”</p>
<p>David Smith, Senior Advisor PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), refers to efforts to counter ‘treaty shopping’ leading to increasing challenges and disputes in relation to structures long used by Asian groups to hold investments in other countries. “At the same time, the OECD’s work in areas such as the meaning of ‘permanent establishment’ and ‘beneficial ownership’ for tax treaty purposes is also calling into doubt the viability of such structures. When all of these matters are taken together, there is little doubt that the management of taxes in Asia has become more complex over the last 12 months.”</p>
<p>Dezan Shira &amp; Associates provides tax advice to foreign direct investors across Asia. Chris Devonshire-Ellis, Principal and Founding Partner of its Singapore office, says the unharmonised nature of the region means reform of tax regulations has been patchy and that the pace of change has slowed over the past five years due to uncertainties caused by the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>“Financial uncertainty is not a friend of liberal tax reform,” he says, referring to Vietnam as one of the most assertive Asian nations in this respect over the last 12 months. “Vietnam has been taking the lead in aggressively targeting China in terms of reducing tax levels for attracting light manufacturing from south China in particular. Tax breaks and rates in Vietnam are two points lower than in China now as a result.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, India has been particularly haphazard when considering corporate tax reforms, he suggests. “New tax laws and regulations generally don’t increase the financial and compliance burden on companies – the overall desire has been to find ways to lessen the tax burden and stimulate foreign investment. But while the intent may be there, much has yet to be done to see that actually realised in policy, with India being a prime example.”</p>
<p>However, changes are afoot in the world’s second most populous nation. In late February, India’s Finance Minister presented a budget that included several notable proposals, including introducing the country’s GAAR from April 2015 and increasing tax rates applicable to business income of foreign companies above certain thresholds and to royalties and fees for technical services paid to non-residents.</p>

<p>Start now.  If there is one thing that you should take away from this guide, it is that you need to start planning your Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) migration now, if you haven’t already.  The 1<sup>st</sup> February 2014 deadline is swiftly approaching and the months leading up to it will fly by.  This is a major project that can take six to nine months or even a year to complete, depending on your organisation’s complexity.

<p>In the beginning, the frontrunners were those that could identify a clear business case and quantify the benefits to be gained from migrating to SEPA – Electrabel, a subsidiary of GDF Suez and ING client, is one such leading light.  To date these have tended to be global corporates that make numerous cross-border transactions, which can see immediate payback from lower costs for cross-border payments.  But for those more domestic or smaller corporates that still look upon SEPA as a burden, it is important to understand what benefits SEPA can bring to treasury.</p>
<p>SEPA is a catalyst for rationalising a corporate’s banking landscape, by reducing the number of bank accounts and bank relationships, and standardising its payments IT environment, by moving to the ISO 20022 XML format.  The IT department, for one, will be relieved to only deal with one format across the whole Eurozone, but needs also to be mindful that there can be different appendices attached to the standard.  ISO 20022 XML also provides extra fields that generate more information to improve reconciliation and reporting, as well as supporting centralising concepts such as shared service centres (SSCs) and payment factories.  With XML you can do both SEPA and non-SEPA transactions, which means the format can be used in a global context.</p>
<p>SEPA can also be used as a trigger to review and optimise a company’s business processes.  For example, SEPA introduces common cut-off times for payments that all countries and banks must adhere to.  Since the end date was legally adopted in February 2012, SEPA has gained the urgency needed to be on the Board’s agenda in order to obtain the funding and IT resources needed for such a major change programme.  Today corporates are treating SEPA as a ‘real’ project, with a dedicated project manager, allocated budget and people.  This is an encouraging sign.</p>
<p>However, despite this impetus, SEPA uptake remains low and uneven across the countries involved, as illustrated in a number of industry surveys.  For example, according to a recent survey by Steria, 30% of French and German businesses had not initiated activity to migrate to SEPA, whereas more than 75% of UK businesses did not even know the deadline.</p>
<p>The European Central Bank (ECB) SEPA Indicators demonstrate the low level of implementation.  As of December 2012, the share of SEPA Credit Transfers (SCTs), as a percentage of the total volume of credit transfers generated by bank customers, amounted to 34.86% in the euro area.  SEPA Direct Debits (SDDs) are lagging even further behind at 1.91%.  Nonetheless, there are some countries, such as Belgium, which are far advanced in their national migration plans and many lessons can be learnt from their experience.</p>
<p>Not becoming SEPA-compliant carries with it many risks.  Corporates could face cash flow and liquidity issues if payments don’t go through.  In order to help our clients become SEPA-compliant within the timeframe, ING has launched a number of initiatives to help drive adoption.  We reached out to all our corporate clients to find out which stage they are at and what help they will need in order to migrate by the deadline.  SEPA roundtables, hosted by ING for corporate clients, provide real-life case studies to share best practice and overcome challenges to implementation.  We also allocate a SEPA migration manager for large clients that still need to perform in-depth impact analyses.  In addition, we have started an information campaign to bring the smaller corporates and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) on board.</p>
<p>By building up our SEPA knowledge and sharing this experience over the years, ING can help clients manage their migration projects as optimally as possible, including a step-by-step plan of approach.  We advise them to do a complete analysis of how SEPA migration will affect different business units, so that they have all the data they need before they begin constructing a plan.  In addition, at the beginning of this year we launched online training, ‘SEPA Get Ready’, for every corporate – clients and non-clients alike – which can help you with all stages of your preparations (see page three for a closer look).</p>
<p>Migration to SCT and SDD ahead of the deadline is achievable, manageable and advantageous to all companies.  Preparation, however, is crucial and the time to start is now.</p>

Three steps to SEPA,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>The background to and benefits of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) have been widely discussed. With the migration deadline of 1<sup>st</sup> February 2014 fast approaching, corporates should be seriously considering how they can make SEPA-compliance work for them. But for Deutsche Bank’s Karsten Becker, Senior Product Manager, European Corporate Payables and Receivables, now is also the time for action. So, for treasurers who have yet to embark on a SEPA project, what needs to be done?</p>

<h4 class=""fn"">Karsten Becker</h4>
<h5 class=""title"">Senior Product Manager for European corporate payables and receivables</h5>
<img alt=""Deutsche Bank"" class=""logo org"" height=""20"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/logo/deutsche-bank-logo-2012-133x20.png"" width=""133""/>
<p>Karsten Becker is Senior Product Manager for European corporate payables and receivables. In this role, he is responsible for the development, positioning, and growth of corporate payables and receivables products, including legacy and SEPA credit transfers and direct debits. Before joining Deutsche Bank in 2007, Becker spent eight years in the US, where he held positions in product management and risk management for both Citigroup and The Bank of New York Mellon. Becker holds a Master’s of Business Administration from The University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana.</p>

<p>This is a high-level call to action. SEPA is looming, and corporates that fail to act could very quickly be looking at failed payments and perhaps far more serious consequences. The financial and practical benefits of SEPA have seen much publicity since the idea was born and, at this late stage, corporates should focus on these benefits – rather than dwell on the negatives of non-compliance – as they make plans to migrate. That being said, all migration plans – whether spurred into action by fears of missing the deadline, or in anticipation of the potential gains – must begin with solid advice and guidance.</p>

<p>There are three basic steps that must be taken and, given the amount of work that needs to be done, the pressure to start now should not be resisted, despite the myriad other projects competing for your time, effort and resources.</p>
<h4 id=""step-1-take-a-realistic-view-of-where-you-are-today-and-identify-the-gaps-between-thispoint-and-where-you-need-to-be"">Step 1. Take a realistic view of where you are today and identify the gaps between thispoint and where you need to be</h4>
<p>This means finding answers to questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In what ways does SEPA impact your organisation?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How embedded are local payment formats in the company’s processes?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the company BIC and IBAN ready?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What third party software (ERP/TMS) do you use and is it able to accommodate SEPA (eg. for reconciliation)?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, it is important to recognise that a SEPA project will require both budget and time. Analysis tends to be one of the longer phases of a SEPA project. Corporates that are entering this phase now do not have the luxury of time to take a leisurely approach to systems and process analysis, especially as the follow-on phases should be completed before financial year-end processes start to freeze certain activities, especially around IT. With this in mind, a February 2014 deadline realistically means a November 2013 deadline and reaching project completion before the end of this year should be the goal.</p>
<h5 id=""action-points-here"">Action points here:</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Appoint a project team – in-house and with your key partners (banks/vendors).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure internal lines of communication stay open and that everyone across the organisation – including senior management – understands the risks of not being SEPA-compliant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review administrative processes and systems. Identify areas that are lacking – eg mandate management for the SEPA Direct Debit (SDD), or the capacity to deploy the ISO 20022 XML message format.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=""step-2-get-a-plan-in-place-and-take-action-to-upgrade-your-infrastructure"">Step 2. Get a plan in place and take action to upgrade your infrastructure</h4>
<p>Whether opting for a wholesale changeover to SEPA, or a phased roll-out of changes, corporations need to have a migration plan. Points to consider when drawing up the plan include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Will you roll out SEPA on a country-by-country basis? (Bear in mind the country-specific requirements).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will you adopt SDDs or SEPA Credit Transfers (SCT)? Which will you adopt first?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How will BIC and IBAN be obtained? Is a vendor solution appropriate?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will the company do its own mandate management for SDDs? Or is a third party solution preferable?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the company require systems updates in order to be SEPA-ready (eg IBAN, XML)? If so, what specifically is required?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What documentation changes are required?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once these questions have been answered, a final plan should be drawn up that outlines deadlines for each part of the project to be in place. When looking at a timescale for the project, remember to allocate sufficient time to roll out the changes and don’t forget to incorporate adequate time to test them.</p>
<h4 id=""step-3-make-the-change"">Step 3. Make the change</h4>
<p>The third step is to execute the migration plan, while paying attention to accounts information and reconciliation processes, which can often go under the radar. Some final checks will be necessary at this point and these should include answers to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Are all your payment processes SEPA-ready? (You do not want to be stuck with failed payments or face huge wire bills because you were unable to pay a supplier or an employee, for example).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are the company’s collections SEPA-compliant?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have the reconciliation processes been adjusted?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And what about all the associated IT processes – can the ERP reconcile with SEPA formats?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have all stakeholders – internal and external – been adequately consulted and kept fully up-to-date with the changes?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have staff been trained appropriately on SEPA? This could be anything from new software to new procedures.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SCT projects are often tackled before their SDD counterparts, but in reality there is no requirement regarding the order taken. Either way, there will almost certainly at this stage be an overlap between some of the steps and elements of the project. Companies should be looking to complete the analysis phase by the end of Q1; carry out phase two’s adjustments and upgrades to the IT infrastructure by the end of Q2; and aim to have account information, migration and testing finished by the end of Q3. This will leave a buffer zone into Q4 for any clean-up activities that may be required (bearing in mind that this may also run up against year-end procedures).</p>
<p>While the project appears daunting, for corporates investing time and resources now, as well as setting aside a window of around two to three months for each step, migration to SEPA can still be accomplished in time and pave the way for a centralisation project. However, while SEPA is a real driver for centralisation, the time remaining to migrate means any centralisation project will need to be conducted separately. SEPA compliance by the deadline must be the absolute priority now.</p>
<p>In the event of non-compliance, the worst case scenario is that it may not be possible for the banks to execute certain payments. This may be the case if, for example a payment file which otherwise carries all the necessary information, is not submitted in the required XML format. Businesses should therefore update their own ERP or treasury systems to support the XML file format, or alternatively consider sending their legacy file formats to a third party vendor for conversion.</p>
<p>While there are a number of important activities that must be tackled right away to meet the SEPA deadline, some of the most important “to-dos” for a successful SEPA-migration are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You must obtain all your required IBANs and BICs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must upgrade and update your treasury or ERP systems in order to accommodate these and other SEPA requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must ensure your payments messages are XML-formatted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you intend to use SDD, you must start mandate management now.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a vital project and should be treated with the urgency and gravity it requires; the consequences of not being able to make your payments do not bear delaying the project.</p>
<p>The end result of SEPA-compliance will be well worth the effort. It is only once the ‘get legal’ phase is complete that the ‘real’ benefits of SEPA can be realised.</p>

<p><span>Richard Parkinson (TT):</span> Supply chain finance and cash management seem to be getting closer and closer. Is that a correct perception? If so, is that something the banks are encouraging, or is that being driven by the corporates?</p>


<p><span>Colin Hemsley (Lloyds):</span> Most of the major global banks have been promoting supply chain and working capital solutions for quite some time; although with varying degrees of enthusiasm and success from the corporate side. Over the last eighteen months, corporates have become far more focused on liquidity and that has driven them to look towards monetising their supply chains. This is how the areas of cash and supply chain have grown closer together. On the back of this liquidity focus, we are also seeing greater determination to actually progress with programmes in a way that I don’t believe we had really seen in the previous five years or so.</p>


<p><span>Jason Barrass (J.P. Morgan):</span> I agree. The last eighteen months have been traumatic for the banking community and corporates alike. Many of the natural forms of finance have ebbed away and some of the markets for funding have dried up. It’s quite natural that a treasurer who’s looking to manage cash on a daily basis should start to look at the company’s balance sheet and how it can be made to work harder; for both their customers and themselves. Cash and trade are very much tied together.</p>


<p><span>Alan Ainsbury (Barclays Corporate):</span> It’s important to take into account that the last eighteen months has seen more of a European/UK focus in terms of supply chain, whereas we are still substantially behind the curve in terms of our US cousins when it comes to implementing this type of facility. The liquidity problems over the last two years have actually focused treasurers in the UK more around the working capital cycle and the benefits therein. Supply chain finance has therefore become less of an education piece from finance institutions, and more about requests from corporates to actually engage with them.</p>


<p><span>John Bugeja (RBS):</span> I agree to a point that there is a commonality between supply chain finance and cash management, but I think there is still quite a significant difference as well. Although the data for both supply chain and cash transactions comes from the same source, the cash management workflow is primarily process driven, and almost ‘one touch’, whereas supply chain finance is much more credit intensive. When we mention supply chain finance, we currently tend to focus on the approved payables file, whereas perhaps we should be thinking about other data events that come out of the physical supply chain which could drive credit interventions. This would then make it slightly different from cash.</p>

<p>One of the lessons for the corporates here is that you have data which can drive a variety of different transactions, whether supply chain transactions or clean payment transactions. It makes sense to use that data as efficiently as possible to optimise your own working capital position. Our goal at RBS is to help clients to deliver the data to relevant parties, supporting both types of transactions as seamlessly as possible.</p>


<p><span>Bruce Proctor (Bank of America Merrill Lynch):</span> While I don’t disagree, I would argue a different point here. The banks are finally starting to realise that clients don’t want to buy a product anymore; corporates want us to understand how they run their businesses. So I don’t think that corporates really look at it as ‘cash’ or ‘supply chain’. Clients are interested in: “I need to buy raw materials, I need to transport them, I need to convert them, sell them and collect and then I need to start that cycle all over again. If you can help me do that and facilitate the movement of cash or the movement of goods, that’s really important to me”.</p>
<p>The events of the last year or two have really refocused treasurers and business managers on their supply chains. One of the big lessons learned was that you can squeeze your suppliers too far. So, what we are seeing is more of a willingness on the part of corporate treasurers and corporate export managers or logistics managers to identify key suppliers and work with them to ensure sustainability.</p>


<p><span>Lex Greensill (Citi):</span> To take that a step further I think that one of the interesting things I’ve seen is the shift away from the supply chain relationship being solely based in procurement. It has dawned on companies that credit liquidity is so crucial to the supply chain that it is incumbent upon the treasurer of the corporation and the treasury operation to help to mitigate the risks associated with supply chain operations. Returning to the original question therefore, perhaps the integration of cash and supply chain demonstrates a realisation that our clients’ organisations need to actually pull together to protect their supply chain and ensure that it is able to withstand exogenous events.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Treasurers certainly seem to have a mandate to advance into areas of the business that they haven’t gone into before and as you say, a growing understanding of what is involved, but what about the products and technology that you supply to treasurers? You all tend to supply your own products but aren’t standardised solutions what corporates really want and this is what some third-party solutions provide?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Corporates want choice. Being flexible and working with a third-party supplier is a better solution than rigidly saying, ‘you use our platform, otherwise you don’t do business with us’.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>Bugeja (RBS):</span> Previously we used to design a product and the technology that supported it. We’ve moved beyond that now and are much more flexible about the technology side of offerings. We have different technology solutions for different circumstances, and are open to working with third-party technology providers if that is what the customer wants. RBS supports multi-banked solutions, and the recent developments in bank-agnostic connectivity have made it easier for our clients to retain multiple banking relationships, whilst benefiting from a consistent approach to bank communication and standardised formats.</p>
<p>Corporates want choice. Being flexible and working with a third-party supplier is a better solution than rigidly saying, ‘you use our platform, otherwise you don’t do business with us’.</p>


<p><span>Ainsbury (Barclays Corporate):</span> Also, as the size of the supply chain finance programmes have grown, it would not be sensible for a single financial institution to carry the entire burden of risk. An easier way to do that therefore is to share the risk with other institutions. There are third-party platform providers that finance institutions and banks can actually tie up with that will give them the flexibility to go into a large programme. I think that standardisation may be achieved through that process.</p>


<p><span>Barrass (J.P. Morgan):</span> There are alternatives to working with third-parties, and when we refer to third-parties we mean non-bank entities. For instance, the supply chain market could mirror the rest of the trade market – you could have one bank fronting and then partner banks coming in on a club basis. A move towards a standardised documentation model would allow banks that are joined together in club deals to have consistent levels of comfort of compliance.</p>
<p>Coming back to the point about third-party involvement though, this does pose quite a large reputational risk. The third-parties might be capturing the approved payables data and discounting proceeds and so on, it might also be their platform that the supplier sees, although we do the funding. If the third-party platform falls over at a critical time for your clients, it is imperative to have a contingency plan in place.</p>


<p><span>Hemsley (Lloyds):</span> I think that the interesting point in the question here is about standardisation. I am sometimes left questioning whether standardisation is actually good for the corporate. Very often we’ll have discussions with the customer who’ll say, “Are you talking about supplier finance or reverse factoring or supply chain finance?” and there’ll be different variations and names in every institution.</p>
<p>It comes back to Bruce’s point that generally we don’t want to be talking about a product at that stage. It is about understanding the supply chain and understanding the client’s objectives and particular circumstances. The key is to identify what’s causing the client a problem and trying to provide a solution. So standardisation, I am not sure is a good thing, but flexibility certainly is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Today, core banking relationships are really critical to your success as an organisation and companies are beginning to realise that perhaps capital isn’t a commodity after all…”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>Ainsbury (Barclays Corporate):</span> Most bank systems at the moment have a standard back-end. They all look fairly comparable and the data download they take is much the same from a customer’s accounting system or similar. So in that sense, there is already an element of standardisation. But if you look at the marketplace, certainly in the UK and Europe, we are still pretty young in terms of large supply chain programmes. The difficulty actually starts to arise when the programmes begin to grow and the credit appetite of individual banks is not sufficient to meet the programme size.</p>
<p>Any standardisation around the back-end which enables you to create an asset class that can easily be sold would therefore be a positive step. Anything which makes it easy to engage in risk participation, and do a true sale and get it off your balance sheet completely, or a risk share agreement, that’s the sort of standardisation that the customer doesn’t need to see, but would create appetite and scalability.</p>

</figure>
<p><span>Greensill (Citi):</span> Perhaps just to extend on some of the points raised, I think that there’s been a change in the way that corporates approach the balance of risks in their supply chains. In 2007, capital was virtually free and banks were almost seen as utilities. Today, core banking relationships are really critical to your success as an organisation and companies are beginning to realise that perhaps capital isn’t a commodity after all.</p>
<p>Equally, corporates began during the crisis to hedge their bets between core and speculative banks. It’s the interplay between those two changes that has perhaps altered the way that corporates think about using a third-party provider, in addition to their core banks.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> So what I am hearing is that although you do have your own products, you are all pretty agnostic as to who you deal with, and how you deal with them. You’re happy to deal with third parties?</p>


<p><span>Hemsley (Lloyds):</span> We are certainly willing to deal with third parties. I think the focus, inevitably, given the events of the last eighteen months, will be on relationships and supporting these relationships effectively. As core banks to our clients we want to be able to support their programmes in the best way possible, which means including third-parties. This focus on clients doesn’t mean that we are closed to new transactional business but I think the focus for most banks will be around supporting their core relationships, particularly as constraints around Basel III start to impact.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> What are the issues around Basel III and what does the corporate need to worry about, if anything?</p>


<p><span>Proctor (Bank of America Merrill Lynch):</span> We’ll all have a different interpretation of this, but I think the impact of Basel III for a corporate treasurer is going to be that as capital adequacy requirements are raised in most banking jurisdictions, and as those requirements are passed through the bank to the operating units, the requirement to build in the necessary cost of carrying that capital provision is going to have an impact on the availability of liquidity or credit. This will therefore have a direct impact on the pricing of products and services that we are able to provide to our clients.</p>
<p>The preferential capital weighting of trade instruments is also something to consider.</p>


<p><span>Bugeja (RBS):</span> Under Basel II, there is still reasonably preferential treatment for traditional trade instruments. Basel III, which is really just a proposal at this stage, suggests that off balance sheet exposures or derivative exposures should be treated the same as cash. The rationale behind this was trying to deal with the use of off balance sheet structures to leverage the balance sheet through proprietary transactions and riskier types of transactions. However, the off balance sheet nature of the traditional trade instruments is simply a factor of the business that our customers are doing. We’re not leveraging up the flows that our customers are giving us: they are the same flows, it just happens that they are contingent obligations if they are traditional trade, rather than cash obligations. If Basel III happens in the way that is suggested, that’s going to be a huge challenge for all banks.</p>

<p><span>Hemsley (Lloyds):</span> On the question of what corporates can be doing, short of lobbying the regulators, I think they really just need to be aware. If there are companies out there that are heavy users of contingent liability products and guarantees, LCs, bonds, and so on, that is a real threat. Those corporates need to be thinking about, and certainly monitoring, how the regulatory landscape evolves and thinking about how they would handle any changes. It is much better to be prepared in advance, rather than be hit with a surprise down the line.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Back to the theme of standardisation, what is SWIFT’s role and how relevant is SWIFT’s TSU offering to corporates?</p>


<p><span>Barrass (J.P. Morgan):</span> Fundamentally, corporates of a certain size can and do deal with multiple banks. The banks all talk to each other using SWIFT messaging and it makes sense to extend that to corporates, allowing them to communicate with many banks through a single interface. While SWIFT’s Trade Services Utility (TSU) and the Bank Payment Obligation (BPO) associated with it do extend into the corporate space, as that is where the data is coming from ultimately, the large part of interaction is between the banks.</p>


<p><span>Bugeja (RBS):</span> The Bank Payment Obligation is often referred to as a ‘lite LC’, which is an interesting analogy. Essentially the BPO encapsulates some of the elements of a letter of credit, without the paper documents and with fewer data checkpoints. It is basically an agreement between banks for a payment to be made, thereby providing the seller with some level of comfort.</p>

<p>“There’s no doubt of the movement towards SWIFT connectivity for the corporate cash management market, and that’s something that’s expanded more dramatically over the last few years…”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>Hemsley (Lloyds):</span> There’s no doubt of the movement towards SWIFT connectivity for the corporate cash management market, and that’s something that’s expanded more dramatically over the last few years. From a trade perspective, we don’t detect the same focus or interest there at the moment. As alluded to, I think that for the open account market there are, perhaps other ways of arriving at finance.</p>


<p><span>Bugeja (RBS):</span> It would be great to have comprehensive feedback from corporates, as this provides us with insights into their underlying issues, which in turn allows us to develop solutions to these issues. Would the BPO cause corporates to move from a pure open account basis, where they have acknowledged that there is no bank risk mitigation built into the cycle? Would they be able to do more business as a result, source more goods or sell more goods because this risk mitigation gives them more capacity? And will they be able to borrow more on the back of that because the banks will lend more when it is underpinned by a BPO, rather than on a straight overdraft or debt working capital basis?</p>


<p><span>Proctor (Bank of America Merrill Lynch):</span> One of the big issues with the TSU, in my opinion, is that it has been adopted essentially by the large global banks only. The vast bulk of the SWIFT banks in the emerging markets are not members. But most of the trade that this is designed to handle is in the emerging markets.</p>
<p>So, when people are looking at the BPO, the idea was to solve two problems. Firstly, how do you give those banks in the emerging markets an opportunity to say, ‘Now I have a financeable instrument because, the two primary banks have agreed that they’re going to honour this obligation.’ It was also, I believe, viewed as a way to get more of the emerging markets banks involved in the TSU as a whole.</p>
<p>The TSU offers a matching capability and is an agnostic system in the sense that we’re all SWIFT members. It also offers a set of standards. The BPO is an alternative to the traditional approach to extending financing and how companies make sure their suppliers are able to obtain the working capital they need.</p>


<p><span>Bugeja (RBS):</span> That’s why, in some respects, I think it would get more traction if it were positioned as a ‘lite LC’. Everyone understands that an LC can be used to raise pre-shipment finance.</p>


<p><span>Barrass (J.P. Morgan):</span> The industry has hundreds of years of track record with a letter of credit, and it is a trusted instrument. All of a sudden you bring this ‘big bang’ moment, trying to introduce something different. Unfortunately, that moment happens to coincide with a global financial crisis, and people are therefore not as open to new methods or instruments as they might be.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> So, as a corporate, why should I be paying attention to this development?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“To actually make some success of the TSU, there has to be demand for it from our corporate clients. When there is demand, there’s value in a bank delivering that kind of service, but that’s not what we’re seeing at the moment…”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>Hemsley (Lloyds):</span> Really, what corporates should be doing is getting back into a dialogue with their bank, making sure that their bank understands their supply chain and financing needs. Within that, we’ve talked about some of the available solutions already today and we’ve all got other solutions that may or may not be more appropriate. The TSU should really be viewed as an additional outlet rather than a fully blown solution.</p>

<p><span>Ainsbury (Barclays Corporate):</span> To actually make some success of the TSU, there has to be demand for it from our corporate clients. When there is demand, there’s value in a bank delivering that kind of service, but that’s not what we’re seeing at the moment. There is certainly a great deal of interest but nobody’s actually knocking on the door and asking for TSU capabilities.</p>


<p><span>Hemsley (Lloyds):</span> The TSU does touch on the issues around e-invoicing though and solutions may evolve from TSU with the aim of becoming more streamlined. The banks need to build their financing proposition around the flexibility and simplicity of the TSU. Is e-invoicing the way to do that? We’ve all set up e-invoicing programmes and put our toes in the water. As I see it, this area is very much one to watch.</p>


<p><span>Barrass (J.P. Morgan):</span> It’s important to consider the financing of that invoice also. The faster the invoice enters the workflow, the sooner it can be financed. If the bank can actually get involved in looking at the invoicing and auditing that as well, there’s an opportunity then to finance for an even longer period. So I would argue that for banks to insert themselves right in the middle of this whole process is a value add. For example, there are certain invoices which the bank could audit and potentially make savings on for the client – such as invoices which are incorrectly raised.</p>


<p><span>Proctor (Bank of America Merrill Lynch):</span> I think one of the clear worries for corporates coming out of the turmoil of the last two years is, ‘can you count on your banks to be there, when you really need them?’ Realistically, many corporates had very difficult experiences of credit limits being cut and purchase orders not being financed for instance. That happened for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>But the expectation that ‘I have a line of credit at bank x and I’m going to be able to draw on it when I need it’ has completely changed. Those people that have moved to open account have essentially made a conscious decision to self-finance and move away from reliance on banks. The TSU was designed to re-intermediate the banks, through the payment streams, back into trade.</p>
<p>But it was up to the banks to create the product – we had to decide how we were going to market this to our customers. And were they going to view the BPO as a proxy for an LC or were they going to view it as a super-payment? SWIFT called it an enhanced payment, but it’s really more than that. For me, that is the whole driver behind the TSU, but I think unfortunately that many of our clients either haven’t understood or we haven’t explained it very well as to what the real value is here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“One thing that we’ve seen recently, which surprised me slightly, was corporate clients choosing to self-fund a supplier financing arrangement…”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>Bugeja (RBS):</span> But when the banks were dis-intermediated it was because the corporates were happy without the intermediation of the banks. So the fact that we want to re-intermediate is great but the corporates have still got to have a reason to let us back in – they’ve got to recognise that they receive some value from our intermediation.</p>


<p><span>Barrass (J.P. Morgan):</span> The last couple of years should actually have set the tone for corporates to realise that perhaps open account isn’t the best way. Corporates might be thinking, ‘Maybe we want an instrument which is not as labour intensive as a letter of credit but delivers many of the same benefits and provides a financing vehicle on the back of the risk mitigation, which works better than credit insurance.’ After all, many corporates in the open account space have said that they don’t need the banks because they have access to credit insurance.</p>


<p><span>Bugeja (RBS):</span> I think the danger is that we ask our clients the wrong questions. If you ask them outright, ‘Do you want a BPO?’, they are going to say, ‘No, not really, I’m happy on open account.’ We need to ask them questions around what’s keeping them awake at night when they are financing or taking on export contracts. ‘What is it that worries you? What are the constraints on doing more business? If you could have more of one thing, what would it be?’ If the corporates come back and say, ‘We are concerned about the risk,’ or ‘Our suppliers can’t get enough pre-shipment finance therefore they can’t do the business’, that would be a clue for us as to the value in the BPO.</p>
<p>But call it a BPO, call it a ‘lite LC’, call it what you like; I do think it would be a lot easier if we could piggy back on the existing rules for LCs, so that there’s legal precedent and a greater degree of certainty about what happens in the event of a dispute. That would certainly make the BPO much more useful.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> What other trends are you seeing in the supply chain space at the moment and what crucial advice would you offer to corporates?</p>

<img alt=""Portrait of Bruce Proctor"" height=""225"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2010/10/2010-10-tt-10-ttf-bruce-proctor-200x225.jpg"" width=""200""/>

</figure>
<p><span>Proctor (Bank of America Merrill Lynch):</span> One thing that we’ve seen recently, which surprised me slightly, was corporate clients choosing to self-fund a supplier financing arrangement. In other words, they set up their programme, without any bank funding involvement. I find that interesting because one of the big drivers supposedly behind supply chain finance is the provision of additional liquidity, but certain corporates are making an argument (which may be temporary) which is, ‘interest rates are so low at the moment that I’m getting almost no return. Perhaps my most effective use of capital at the moment would be to finance my own suppliers.’ If rates rise dramatically, they may decide that this isn’t in fact the best use of capital.</p>
<p>At the same time, we’ve also had a number of requests from the second generation of suppliers, where someone who is a supplier in a programme for a large buyer says, ‘I’d like to do this for my suppliers.’ So, it’s starting to work its way down into the second level of the market.</p>


<p><span>Bugeja (RBS):</span> And it comes down to credit appetite again, because you’re working on the general assumption that the supplier does not have as good a credit rating as the buyer. One of the opportunities is then to leverage the fact that you’ve just enhanced the credit quality of that supplier by virtue of the fact that they are on your buyer-led programme, so your appetite to support them in an upstream programme should be greater.</p>


<p><span>Ainsbury (Barclays Corporate):</span> The simpler the customer requirements, the more standard the product becomes. At the top end of the programme, clients want a bespoke solution that fits their system. The further you move down the level of complexity a standardised product becomes a necessity from a delivery perspective because the scalability of that particular programme will not be sufficient to make a bespoke type solution viable. So that standardisation becomes key, the further down the chain you actually go.</p>


<p><span>Greensill (Citi):</span> But doesn’t that then create an issue for the clients? A question some of my clients have posed to me is, ‘Aren’t you just cherry picking the best credits out of my suppliers? And so by plucking those out don’t you just exacerbate the problems of my suppliers and perhaps make the situation worse, or make it difficult for them in terms of their ability to otherwise, finance the working capital of their business?’</p>


<p><span>Hemsley (Lloyds):</span> I think that one of the interesting things to note is that of the very large programmes that we’ve put in place, the number of suppliers that take up the offer is still very limited. We have also had a number of suppliers, however, that have participated in a larger programme and looked to extend that. The great thing with that is that the communication that they then give to their suppliers is usually considerably more directed as they understand the positives of such a programme.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard stories of companies with almost €3 billion of receivables on their balance sheet, which they weren’t monetising…”</p>

<img alt=""Portrait of Jason Barrass"" height=""225"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2010/10/2010-10-tt-10-ttf-jason-barrass-200x225.jpg"" width=""200""/>
<figcaption>
<h6>Jason Barrass, J.P. Morgan</h6>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span>Barrass (J.P. Morgan):</span> Of course, there is still a great deal of uncertainty in the banking landscape. I don’t think that either the markets or the banks have fully recovered from a liquidity perspective, compared to pre-crisis levels.</p>
<p>There is also a significant amount of uncertainty around regulation, such as Basel III, which we touched on earlier. While the majority of banks have been very diligent with regard to capital adequacy and so on, certain European banks have not put away perhaps as much capital as they ought to in order to meet the G20 standards.</p>
<p>I would therefore encourage treasurers to look at how they can make their balance sheet work much harder. They need to look at what they’ve got on it, not just on the supply chain side for their customers, but also on the receivables side. I’ve heard stories of companies with almost €3 billion of receivables on their balance sheet, which they weren’t monetising. If you start to monetise that correctly, it could be that the company doesn’t have to go to the capital markets for a year. At a time when the capital markets are still not back to where they were before, that could be a distinct advantage.</p>


<p><span>Ainsbury (Barclays Corporate):</span> My advice to corporates is that they really need to stay close to their key banks and develop relationships with them so they understand where the markets are and what tools are available to them. Like Jason, I believe that corporates don’t always make their balance sheet work hard enough because primarily they don’t understand what’s available to help them to make that happen.</p>
<p>As for market trends, I think that you will see a push back down the supply chain. At the moment, with the payables piece at least, there is a move to push back further from a bank perspective. That can only benefit corporates, however, if they understand the rationale behind that and where they are currently missing out – such as the ability to finance invoices earlier if they are presented electronically.</p>


<p><span>Hemsley (Lloyds):</span> The focus on liquidity for corporate treasurers and the supply chain is a very logical one, and as such I would expect that to persist. Treasurers should continue to look to maximise the opportunities to monetise across the supply chain and maintain the level of dialogue with their banks and key strategic partners.</p>
<p>However, I don’t believe that we have yet maximised the opportunities and efficiencies that can be found across the supply chain. In hard percentage terms, probably no more than 20% to 30% of the opportunities across the corporate market have been capitalised on to-date. But whose fault is that? I think the responsibility lies on both the corporate and bank sides. It is only by building that collective understanding and helping corporates to identify areas that they can manipulate, that the banks can help to add value by providing either cash flow acceleration or risk elimination/ mitigation solutions – depending on what is driving the corporate agenda.</p>


<p><span>Bugeja (RBS):</span> That would certainly be an interesting direction for the bank to head towards, but it will be a long journey, looking at the supply chain on an end-to-end basis. The Holy Grail is that we have a basis for capturing data from the physical supply chain, which demonstrates that corporate performance risk is being progressively reduced up to the point when an approved payable lands on the desk. Therefore our ability to finance prior to the approved payable should be modelled on the degree to which that performance risk is being mitigated. But this has to be automated and I don’t think anyone can do that – or not very effectively at the moment. Perhaps the TSU and the BPO have a part to play in making that happen.</p>


<p><span>Hemsley (Lloyds):</span> There is just one last thing that I would encourage corporates to do and that is to not eliminate products or solutions from consideration without having a conversation with their bank, exploring the possibilities. I’ve often met with corporates saying, ‘So and so talked to us about supplier financing and we’ve decided that it is not for us’. Even today, there are perceptions around supplier finance and supply chain solutions that are still quite narrow.</p>
<p>Make sure you explore all the options fully and don’t eliminate possibilities based on a perception of what a particular product is, but explore the wider interpretations. When we’re talking about supply chain, we are talking about receivables as well as payables and there are many opportunities available.</p>


<p><span>Greensill (Citi):</span> Another key trend is that the role of the corporate treasurer is still evolving. One example of that is that the corporate treasurer is taking on a role to defend and protect the company’s supply chain. But I think there’s an extension beyond that – we are moving away from a high growth environment to an environment where we’re experiencing lower growth for a longer period of time. As a result, the focus is perhaps less on driving increased sales, because those opportunities don’t exist anymore, the question is now more about achieving an extra few basis points of margin.</p>
<p>In the past, treasury was not really considered as a potential profit centre for organisations. But when the initial focus on cost-cutting began as a reaction to the crisis, treasury became more heavily involved in protecting the supply chain. I think you’re going to see that extend to a point where the procurement manager is saying, ‘I want you to help me squeeze more savings, not just squeezing cash out of the supply chain, but actually helping us to take cost out of the way that our whole supply chain does business.’</p>
<p>Our clients are really focused on margin at the moment and talking to the bank about these issues is a key conversation. I agree with Colin’s point that you shouldn’t be closed- minded. The supply chain landscape is evolving all the time and I think it’s about trying to pick the best practice that’s going on in the market today.</p>


<p><span>Proctor (Bank of America Merrill Lynch):</span> Lex has a very good argument. My suggestion would be that corporates need to continue to focus on the synergies within their own companies. As banks, we are always accused of being very siloed and I think we are. It must be very frustrating for our corporate clients to have to keep re-educating us and telling their story over again. But I have been surprised at how many corporate conversations we have where we speak to the finance people and the logistics people and yet the two teams have never spoken to each other.</p>
<p>The opportunity within the corporation itself to look for cost savings or efficiencies, or just better co-ordination, is certainly something that the banks could help with. I think we should be looking for ways to partner and deliver more along those lines. I could for instance call up the treasurer or the CFO of a company and say, ‘Would you be interested if I could put $10m into your P&amp;L this year?’ Of course, the answer is going to be yes; I then say, ‘Well you should make sure you get to know your logistics manager. He can do this for you, he can help you create some of these savings.’ So, to some extent, perhaps our role is still as intermediaries, if we are getting smarter as providers in terms of taking a broader view and looking through the supply chain and understanding how our clients look at their own conversion cycles. That then opens up a much more interesting set of conversations around working together to unlock some of those significant inefficiencies that still sit inside the corporate structure.</p>

<h3 id=""after-the-crisis-or-crisis-as-usual"">After the crisis, or ‘crisis as usual’?</h3>
<h4 id=""relationships"">Relationships</h4>

<p><span>Richard Parkinson (TT):</span> I’d like to start with bank relationships, particularly looking at credit. What are you, as banks, doing differently post-crisis?</p>


<p><span>Marilyn Spearing (Deutsche Bank):</span> My relationships with corporates are falling into two very distinct camps. There are those that are awash with liquidity, not in need of credit, and looking for how they’re going to place it. And there are those that are constrained, and are looking for access to credit in a different way.</p>
<p>In terms of how we are looking at that, the banks have made commitments to the governments that they would continue lending. There are various forms of those programmes, but I think the biggest thing that I’m seeing is that everyone’s looking to get much more secure lending in place. There is a lot of focus on transactional finance, supply chain finance, because generally your lending is needed further down the credit chain from the top tier. The dialogue has become very open and frank. If the bank is going to put its balance sheet forward, how do we then have a deeper relationship and get compensated for that?</p>


<p><span>Michael Guralnick (Citi):</span> Coming out of the crisis, companies are looking to us to provide them with more innovative solutions to help them drive efficiency and access sources of liquidity that they may not have accessed before. They are looking further into the supply chain – into the areas of distributor, customer and supplier financing, and are challenging us to find innovative ways of helping them to ensure stability within that supply chain. In terms of credit, they are looking for support from their banks holistically across their commercial businesses, rather than just for direct lending.</p>


<p><span>Tarek Anwar (Standard Chartered):</span> One of the things that we looked at through the whole crisis was how to continue to support our clients.  While some banks did pull back their balance sheet, causing issues for some of the corporates, we didn’t. When you look at a client’s ecosystem, the issue really is with the SMEs and with the middle market clients in smaller companies that may get short of liquidity and therefore interrupt the operations that affect a big multinational. So you have to be on the ground, you have to be able to support both the buyers and the suppliers, and that was quite critical.</p>
<p>I think the crisis itself also taught both the banks and the corporates the importance of the counterparty risk issues. Corporates weren’t just asking “where do I place my deposits?”, but “who stays with me through this cycle?” and “who can actually help me survive?”</p>


<p><span>Luc Caulier (BNP Paribas):</span> For a long time we have had a development model focused on customer service and based from the very beginning on a balanced business portfolio, meticulous risk management and genuine flexibility. Following the acquisition of Fortis Bank and BGL, we have four domestic markets: France, Italy, Belgium and Luxembourg, where we are able to offer strong proximity. We continue to carry out our primary mission of helping clients to optimise their working capital and make their collections more efficient. In general, we will continue to see that financing is moving closer to the business cycle, with trade finance, inventory finance and factoring solutions, for example.</p>


<p><span>Alex Caviezel (J.P. Morgan):</span> There’s an interesting paradigm that’s developed if you look at the statistics. Bank deposits and sweeps are up significantly, so there’s lots of liquidity, and yet treasurers remain preoccupied with where and how they can obtain funding. So what we’re seeing now is a shift of focus towards driving internal costs down through process efficiencies, as well as on liquidity management techniques for self-funding. And also we are seeing far more attention paid to counterparty risk.</p>
<p>You know, companies have become much more adept at managing through the crisis now. In fact, they’re moving into a second phase, and they are getting a lot more demanding of financial institutions. Essentially, it’s a matter of trying to find alternatives to maximise funding – and it’s not always in the most classical manner. We engage with clients to discuss novel and highly creative methods and this promotes broader dialogue which often uncovers the opportunity for other areas of business development.</p>


<p><span>Dub Newman (Bank of America Merrill Lynch):</span> Probably the only thing I’d add is that it is much more than a supply chain relationship. There have been times in my banking career where some clients saw it that way. Now, however, I think our corporates have the same motivations as us: more capital, more liquidity, more focus on risk. We have common denominators in our dialogue that make for a healthy partnership that looks beyond a click price, or a margin on a deposit.</p>
<p>Around six months ago, there was an interesting dialogue about whether we would forget 2008/2009. I think the world is looking a bit more like 2008 right now with everything that’s out there, and it’s important that we don’t forget that. Those lessons are a part of a healthy relationship, and also a healthy financial institution/corporate banking environment.</p>

<h4 id=""crisis-as-usual"">Crisis as usual?</h4>

<p><span>Spearing (Deutsche Bank):</span> I am intrigued with this idea of a second stage of the crisis. Have corporates become so used to the economic crisis that now they’re viewing it as ‘business as usual’? I would say that they have.</p>


<p><span>Caviezel (J.P. Morgan):</span> You’re beginning to see companies aligning to that reality. I think a lot has already been said about how much more influential the treasurer is and it feels as though there’s been a slight shift in corporates’ organisational structure: the treasurer is much more visible; the CFO is much more aware of the value that the treasurer can add; the treasury systems are much more refined; and I think the treasury function has become a lot more focused on efficiency.</p>

<p><span>Anwar (Standard Chartered):</span> I’d like to tie together these two themes: the shift in roles and ‘crisis as usual’. I think that the treasurer and CFO roles have become very much more closely aligned with the business than before. Rather than being viewed as a support function, they’re actually there at the table.</p>
<p>Another important point is that practically everywhere in the world, regulatory change and regulatory risk and interpretation is affecting businesses quite a lot. That requires a high degree of interpretation, and working with partners like banks that will help them either understand or even lobby for that change – especially in some of the high growth emerging markets.</p>
<p>So I think there’s an added dimension. It’s ‘crisis as usual’ at home, but you have to be able to navigate the places where you want to grow. You cannot just stay in your home market anymore.</p>


<p><span>Guralnick (Citi):</span> It’s not just the funding and liquidity side that has changed. Coming out of the crisis, treasurers are thinking more critically about how they manage the different risks. While they continue to be concerned about counterparty risk, they are also thinking about how they manage settlement risk. “I have money, I have to move it, I have to settle. What is the risk of moving it through the system? Then once I have it somewhere, how do I deal with the resulting liquidity?” There are more opportunities to place funds in portals and different instruments. I think the landscape is becoming much more exciting for treasurers.</p>


<p><span>Caulier (BNP Paribas):</span> In times of crisis, and when funding is becoming scarce, we look at the different strategies adopted by corporates. Foremost, is the diversification of funding; choosing more banks where they get their credit and invest their surplus. This, however, is not the only technique. Corporates also try to optimise their internal processes, in particular those linked to their procurement/payments/sales/receivables chain. We often see walls within companies between these different departments, as we still see walls between supplier finance, trade and cash management with banks. Breaking through these walls creates large opportunities for both corporates and banks, releasing cash from the operational cycle to provide for (part of) their funding.</p>

<p><span>Spearing (Deutsche Bank):</span> Treasurers can now see the value of self-funded supplier programmes where they’re saying, “We have that liquidity, but we want to use some other systems to help us get a smooth process.” Maybe that’s that creativity you were alluding to, Michael, everyone really trying to say “how do I get access further down the chain?” and “which way is that handled?”, and that does come back to technology.</p>


<p><span>Caviezel (J.P. Morgan):</span> I think the success of the supply chain concept today is coming to the fore because there is a clearer definition of different types of credit than in the past. Companies with a better credit rating are in a position to leverage this strength and support those who are of a lower credit rating, for example, a large multinational buyer leveraging its own credit risk to support a smaller supplier. The supply chain concept has been around longer in certain countries where there has been a net differentiation in credit risk, but not in countries where it has been more even. So what you’ve got here is an evolution of the risk management concept and a gradual proliferation of this new approach throughout the region.</p>


<p><span>Anwar (Standard Chartered):</span> The interesting thing is they also don’t want recourse – they don’t want it on their balance sheet. They’re asking us to make the magic happen, which is what we all do.</p>


<p><span>Guralnick (Citi):</span> I think at the end of the day, over and above the innovative solutions banks develop, when I speak with treasurers and CFOs, they make it eminently clear that if you’re not putting up your balance sheet, you’re not going to get a piece of the wallet.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> And are you meeting those demands?</p>


<p><span>Anwar (Standard Chartered):</span> Yes we are.</p>


<p><span>Spearing (Deutsche Bank):</span> And I agree with Michael, there is a real deepening on a relationship level, and people are deciding who their friends are.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Deepening, but not exclusive anymore. There was a time when some companies were getting close to one bank solution: and that’s gone, hasn’t it?</p>


<p><span>Anwar (Standard Chartered):</span> If you look at US corporates, European corporates or others, who are going to China, and India, and so on, they are looking at the old revolver that they used to have in the US that used to sit there and not get used. They’re saying “well actually why do I need that here, why don’t I put it in the markets that I need?” So therefore they might look at a different panel of banks. They may still need their lead bank to help them with that, but they will still go into different markets which means they look at different domestic collection structures that are regional structures and so on.</p>


<p><span>Guralnick (Citi):</span> As companies invest in new markets such as China and India, they may look to supplement their international bank relationships with a local bank. However, they also continue to rely heavily on their primary banking partners such as Citi – global banks that have local expertise, as well as the capital and innovative solutions to support their needs as they grow in these new markets.</p>

<h4 id=""collections-are-the-new-battleground"">Collections are the new battleground</h4>

<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> This does broaden out the number of banks that they can look at as well, doesn’t it? So that means you are facing more competition, in a way.</p>


<p><span>Anwar (Standard Chartered):</span> Not really, because we are in Asia, Africa and the Middle East mainly, so those are our territories and we have a pretty good handle on them. I think the issue really is where you have a very strong relationship that a corporate has with a US bank or a European bank in their own territory. And they’re getting demands from their bank to also participate in areas like Africa, for example, which they may not be very strong in. So, it’s that shift of saying “I need to go into new territories, I need to invest where there’s growth, but also are the capital markets deep enough; can I do what I do at home in some of those markets?” That’s the challenge.</p>


<p><span>Spearing (Deutsche Bank):</span> I would say yes, we’re facing loads more competition. It has always been a really fragmented market, you know, the total cash management marketplace between domestic, regional and global players. And some of the strong domestics are moving out into other countries.</p>


<figure class=""portrait left""><img alt=""Portrait of Luc Caulier"" height=""225"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2010/09/2010-09-tt-05-ttf-luc-caulier-200x225.jpg"" width=""200""/>

<p><span>Caulier (BNP Paribas):</span> The choice of the banks that companies are going to use is very much dependent on having a local collections offering. We see a lot of common ways of doing things on the payments side, but on the collections side, the countries are still extremely different from one another. As for all of us, it is extremely important for companies to get paid. The ability to offer clients smooth ways of getting paid is starting to determine, to a certain extent, the choice of banks by corporates. We are putting a lot of emphasis on collection solutions. We have a deep-rooted bank in four domestic markets as well as in Poland and Turkey. BNP Paribas also offer cash and card solutions, we are able to assist our customers in their local collections and have recently developed lockbox solutions in several European countries.</p>


<p><span>Spearing (Deutsche Bank):</span> I call that ‘collections as the new battleground’. The payments world is fairly well taken care of with shared service centres and so on – there’s still room to improve, but really it’s collections that count.</p>


<p><span>Caviezel (J.P. Morgan):</span> On the other hand, whilst the level of competition on the payments side might be going up, the fact that you’ve got this fragmentation out there means that the difficulties associated with collections are actually leading to greater levels of co-operation between financial institutions, ironically. There’s a greater willingness amongst financial institutions to leverage each other’s core competencies as long as the client bases are well defined and differentiated.</p>


<p><span>Guralnick (Citi):</span> Payments are all about cost management amidst increasing regulatory pressure, and given the challenges involved in developing new technology, many banks have chosen not to invest in technological infrastructure and instead, opted to focus their resources on the front end and managing their clients. They choose to partner with institutions such as Citi that can provide them with a global platform with the breadth and reach they need. Part of Citi’s strategy on the financial institutions side is to work with these banks, offering them the ability to leverage our platforms and free them up to focus on building their client relationships.</p>
<p>Additionally, we are starting to look at an enterprise payment suite that merges the capabilities of our consumer and corporate banks, in order to access new customers and provide them with added value to help them meet their business challenges. This thinking opens up a whole host of opportunities for payments: for example, it leads us to mobile payments which leads us to consumer-to-consumer payments. The opportunities multiply for an innovative institution like Citi. There remains a large opportunity for growth in the payments space by being innovative and leveraging the core competencies of Citi’s corporate and consumer platforms. The paradigm broadens even further as you create enterprise-wide payment solutions.</p>


<p><span>Anwar (Standard Chartered):</span> When selecting a relationship, clients are not only looking at the credit or the balance sheet, or counterparty risk – they are also asking “What makes that bank tick? How is the staff’s performance being measured? Are there geographic silos? Are there product silos? Do they actually collaborate across those places?” At the end of the day they’re choosing a team and if the fundamentals inside the bank don’t lend themselves to that, no matter what systems you put in place, the client is not going to get the team functioning in the way they want.</p>


<p><span>Newman (Bank of America Merrill Lynch):</span> A healthy relationship involves capital markets, investment banking advice, it involves all these things to get a return for the client, and a return for us that is satisfactory. The relationship between a company’s cash flow management and its capital markets position has never been closer than it is today. The challenge for organisations is that products are important, but it comes down to blocking and tackling between inter-related parties within an institution to serve their clients. I’ll be honest with you, that’s the hardest thing to accomplish. I mean while technology is critically important it’s the integrated interaction with the client that’s the magic bullet, but it is hard to do.</p>


<p><span>Caulier (BNP Paribas):</span> And sometimes it is just about simple things. Electronic bank account management is one solution, it enables corporates to standardise, streamline and also secure account administration. But often the big challenge is entering into a new relationship with the bank in a new country, for a subsidiary for example. “Is this account opening process going to be simple? Will I have to explain everything again locally or do I have a bank with smooth cross-border co-operation and administration?” We believe that it is extremely important to be able to provide this smooth service to our clients. That is the reason why we have created over 100 business centres in most European countries. Their task is to service the subsidiaries of our clients, be it the large corporates or the cross-border operating mid-cap clients.</p>

<h4 id=""sepa"">SEPA</h4>

<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> We’ve got this far through the conversation and SEPA hasn’t yet come up. What’s going on in the SEPA space?</p>


<p><span>Spearing (Deutsche Bank):</span> We’re waiting for the direct debit finalisation in November. I’m still seeing a number of discussions with treasurers who are trying to get the benefit from it and ready themselves for what is the possible opportunity as to where debit will go. To cut a long story short, we’ve always preached it was evolution, not revolution. We’re gradually seeing people changing and we’re shifting a lot of our traffic, when we can we shift it – we shift 70% of our traffic into SEPA format – but it’s a gradual trend.</p>


<p><span>Caulier (BNP Paribas):</span> Something that will accelerate the adoption of SEPA is the proposition by the SEPA Council at the beginning of June that there will actually be end-dates. Our large customers have shown a lot of interest in direct debits because where SEPA payments are relatively straight forward, direct debits are a complete change for them. Up until now it’s usually the banks that make sure the mandates are kept and controlled. With the SEPA Direct Debit, that moves to the companies and many are worried about that. That’s why we offer mandate management solutions to our customers. I agree with you, it’s never going to be a revolution, but if you compare it to a year and a half ago, treasurers are much more concerned and are preparing themselves for the changes ahead.</p>


<p><span>Caviezel (J.P. Morgan):</span> Even in the United States, when there was a move to ACH it didn’t exactly take off immediately, and there you had an environment with a mature single currency market. Here we’re talking about a somewhat different situation. We are still working through a significant economic downturn, which shouldn’t be forgotten – and understandably, people have had their eye on other things than SEPA. So that will obviously have impacted uptake since its launch in 2008, but clearly SEPA remains a monumental industry-wide change, but was never expected to reach critical mass overnight.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> The difficulties that some of the European countries – Greece, Italy, Spain – are getting into is probably not helping this whole process either. Some are even saying that we may see countries coming out of the euro. What advice are you giving to your corporates about this?</p>


<p><span>Spearing (Deutsche Bank):</span> I think this is Europe’s own crisis, but frankly the cash management world is a little bit removed from this. I have not suggested to any clients that they stop transitions or changes that they’re making in their treasury. Really, the discussions with corporates are around what are they going to do within the currency, how are they hedging it, the fact that so much of trade is intra-Europe, there’s a fair amount of natural hedging already in place.</p>


<p><span>Guralnick (Citi):</span> As a result of the crisis, corporates have been doing a lot of contingency planning the past two years. We continue to provide advice to our clients on how they should prepare for possible scenarios. For instance, there has been open discussion in the marketplace on the possibility of some European countries reverting to national currencies. Clients have asked us how we, as their transaction banking partner, would handle that situation should it occur, and in turn, how they should adjust their business systems to prepare.</p>
<p>We continue to advise clients who are in the midst of an implementation to continue on their current path, but to also design possible contingencies for alternative scenarios. Following the recent crisis, clients are more risk averse and are spending a lot of time with us white-boarding alternatives to ensure they have visibility and access to liquidity within their system.</p>

</figure>
<p><span>Newman (Bank of America Merrill Lynch):</span> They’re really interested in understanding what we’re doing. The questions I get are about us – do we have the technology to manage slow but potentially rapid shifts in credit behaviour in a particular country, or with a particular provider? And how are we handling that? I think it’s healthy for our clients to be as interested in how we manage our affairs, as we are in how they manage theirs.</p>

<h4 id=""technology"">Technology</h4>

<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Can we talk about technology – what are you doing, what are you seeing, what advice are you giving to your corporates?</p>


<p><span>Spearing (Deutsche Bank):</span> The biggest change is in the advice we are giving, certainly at Deutsche Bank. Right up until 12 months ago, we were saying to any corporate, “We’re agnostic about what channel you use in accessing your banks. You can come directly to us, or go through SWIFT.” Now that’s changed and we are saying, “If you’re rebuilding your whole infrastructure, you should be adopting SWIFT, and going direct into SWIFT. Build in that longevity.” It’s going to be the route that will drive more efficiencies for them.</p>
<p>Obviously we have been investing a lot in our channels, and what we now see is the two are really going to ride parallel tracks. SWIFT and SCORE and direct access are there for big volumes, and as services become commoditised, that’ll ride the SWIFT rail. But the portals that we’re all investing in, ride that other rail, where corporates are looking for inter-operability to monitor what’s happening in the big box, and to be able to be a bit more fleet of foot. The portal allows us to connect everything and present a transaction bank in its full glory, as opposed to “Here’s your payment access, here’s your collections access, here’s your liquidity access, and, oh by the way, custody is a separate one altogether.”</p>


<p><span>Caulier (BNP Paribas):</span> We have always been a pioneer in SWIFTNet solutions. Today, our bank has more SWIFTNet FileAct customers than any other bank. We’re getting away from the idea that a portal is actually competition to SWIFT. What matters is the added value you build around SWIFT solutions, whether that relates to execution, pooling, visibility or reporting.</p>


<p><span>Newman (Bank of America Merrill Lynch):</span> For big companies using in-house banks or shared service centres, the people who use those portals are not necessarily those who might have used them five years ago. These centres are located in markets and staffed by people who may not have English as their first language. I think the content’s important, but the usability of the capabilities we put in front of our clients needs to target, potentially, a different level of the organisation than we might have historically thought of as just the treasury staff.</p>


<p><span>Anwar (Standard Chartered):</span> It is interesting to think about future users in a corporate environment who may be different from the previous users. What tools will the future decision makers need? It’s about developing the analytics and the information and the pro-activity in the portals that allows them to tailor what they need for that specific function. And it’s the future function.</p>
<p>We talked about the changing role of the treasurer – sometimes it’s a credit manager who would not have necessarily been the guy that you would have been talking to or somebody who’s on the business side who’s actually trying to push sales growth. Those are the spaces that our clients are going into and we’re investing into.</p>


<figure class=""portrait left""><img alt=""Portrait of Alex Caviezel"" height=""225"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2010/09/2010-09-tt-05-ttf-alex-caviezel-200x225.jpg"" width=""200""/>
<figcaption>
<h6>Alex Caviezel, J.P. Morgan</h6>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span>Caviezel (J.P. Morgan):</span> I fully agree with you. SWIFT has to be the way forward for developing standards and infrastructure, but alongside SWIFT, a proprietary channel proposition can add enormous value in terms of reporting, reconciliation, forecasting and analytics. So I really think that SWIFT and home-grown technology can be highly complementary and effective for the corporate treasurer.</p>
<p>The other area that I think which is interesting is CLS. All of a sudden, CLS is becoming another way that corporates are taking advantage of an industry-wide initiative, originally aimed at mitigating FX settlement risk amongst banks. And now these corporates are integrating CLS into their own risk management processes with impressive results.</p>


<p><span>Spearing (Deutsche Bank):</span> Focusing on investment, I continue to see a reluctance among corporates to invest – they’re squeezing that nickel until it hurts. This is not the time when they want to spend a huge amount on their treasury systems; they’re looking at shorter paybacks, but they’re willing to invest if payback is really good. And that’s where I’m seeing in the technology discussion come round on the supply chain type of discussion as to how can I get the information to reduce my days sales outstanding. It’s the trapped liquidity discussion, but not from the traditional cash management angle. They’re now trying to push out into those adjacent areas to say, can I help the collections team find a shorter route? The fertile space, and a difficult one for corporates, is how to get real visibility over what is happening on the collections side of their businesses.</p>


<p><span>Guralnick (Citi):</span> We see corporates accelerating capex for upgrading or building new commercial infrastructure such as plant equipment, and consolidating operations to take advantage of economies of scale. They are preparing their businesses so that they may be well-positioned for growth as economies around the world rebound.</p>
<p>On the other hand, another interesting trend we see is corporates turning to specialised companies to provide their technological infrastructure and architecture, rather than tying up capital for fixed hardware and systems. They are leveraging these specialised companies so that they can take advantage of the newest technologies in the marketplace, without having to invest in the systems themselves.</p>


<p><span>Anwar (Standard Chartered):</span> What is interesting is that it then becomes a bit of a challenge, because it smacks into that brick wall of regulatory change that’s trying to put more defences around client confidentiality within a certain country, and says “Oh, you can’t go and rent somebody else’s stuff across border”. These two smash into each other. Then you’re throwing them into the lap of local banks and local competitors that may want to do that. So it becomes an interesting challenge.</p>


<p><span>Newman (Bank of America Merrill Lynch):</span> You know great technology is important, but if we can’t help our clients figure out how to use it to really improve their business, then it doesn’t mean much. I tell our guys, our clients are looking to you to be the experts of working capital, not the experts in just selling a product. You should be able to be the ones to go in and evaluate their business. You need to understand the value of the solutions, the technology you sell, as much as you value the inner workings of the product. That’s also where you begin to build this relationship that has legs over time.’</p>

<h4 id=""collaboration-or-competition"">Collaboration or competition?</h4>

<p><span>Anwar (Standard Chartered):</span> I think the interesting thing that is happening and is going to happen even more, is the co-investment with clients into spaces. Last year we touched on eBAM, I think, and whether we should get more people and more teeth into it, in terms of clients and co-investing. If you ask what differentiates one bank from another, it is things like being creative and spending money and co-investing, either with other banks or with corporates, in order to get this sort of project off the ground.</p>


<figure class=""portrait left""><img alt=""Portrait of Michael Guralnick"" height=""225"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2010/09/2010-09-tt-05-ttf-michael-guralnick-200x225.jpg"" width=""200""/>
<figcaption>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span>Guralnick (Citi):</span> In this day and age, while we all compete in many areas, there are certainly many ways we can work together. ‘Co-opetition’ is a concept that really resonates today: co-operative competition can be beneficial for all parties – clients, banks and the market.</p>
<p>One area of possible collaboration could certainly be around eBAM. Electronic bank account management is a key topic in the marketplace today – and is a concept that can be equally beneficial to all banks and our respective clients. Rather than each bank doing something individually, working in a collaborative manner would allow us to provide client-centric solutions for the benefit of all our customers. A separate utility such as SWIFT or a similar industry facility may be well positioned to play a leading role in this initiative.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> It does seem to me that anything you can do on a portal potentially could be done through SWIFT. If I was a corporate, I think I’d be saying “Well, actually I would quite like to have a lot of the additional information I want reported through a single portal.”</p>


<p><span>Anwar (Standard Chartered):</span> An aggregator. And that’s the point I think you get within each of the banks – you get what we would call public space and private space, stuff that you would build over a period of time that you would keep in the private space for specific clientele that are yours, and there’s stuff that’s out in the public domain. But if you’re a client that works with a multitude of different banks you don’t want to go to every single individual portal, you want to be able to aggregate.</p>


<p><span>Newman (Bank of America Merrill Lynch):</span> I think your portal is your virtual relationship manager. We all probably do online banking. I go online and I can see my flows in and out, I can view and move money between my parents’, my children’s and my wife’s accounts. That’s not something I’m going to look to SWIFT to create and they wouldn’t know how to do that for my client base either. SWIFT can’t give individuals or companies the flexibility they need, they don’t know where I might have a banking relationship in multiple countries. So I don’t think the portal space is in their space to be able to customise to my need as a company.</p>


<p><span>Caulier (BNP Paribas):</span> The trend is definitely towards a single portal. The client wants to find enriched information on their reporting. As I mentioned before, the treasurer wants global visibility and efficient payment execution, but also needs to have efficient balances management, through investment and pooling, visibility, reconciliation and multibank reporting. Having one or more portals is probably less important than the quality of the information he will find in it.</p>


<p><span>Spearing (Deutsche Bank):</span> Plus with the SCORE model, what some of my clients are telling me is that they are starting to see the difference in the banks very clearly. They thought if they were a SWIFT participant, they would then have access to the 3,000 plus banks and they assumed that every bank participated to the same degree. But what they’re finding is that there are only about 500 banks that are participating in SCORE.</p>


<p><span>Caviezel (J.P. Morgan):</span> I’m confident that we’ll see a steady increase in the number of larger multi-banked corporations connecting directly to SWIFT to streamline the processing of payment instructions and statements. But I also feel that a portal solution, offering a whole dashboard of value-added services is just as much part of the future treasury landscape.</p>

<h4 id=""where-next"">Where next?</h4>

<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Are there any final words of advice you’d like to be giving? Particularly thinking about where we’re going in the next year.</p>


<p><span>Anwar (Standard Chartered):</span> We started off this discussion by looking at relationships, and I think these will continue to be key in the next year. It is relationships, looking at the track record of those relationships, but also looking in detail at those institutions, and not just financial institutions, it could even be other counterparties that they deal with. Going beyond the first layer of coverage and looking at what are its values. I believe there are more and more clients now beginning to say: “We share common values and visions with that institution and therefore that is key to us.” Going forward that is going to be even more important.</p>


<p><span>Spearing (Deutsche Bank):</span> Facing the next 12 months, we know there’s going to be continued economic disruption with new financial regulations and the currencies going through changes. So the advice is to do exactly what they have been doing: to focus on the risk management and have that really crisp dialogue with the bank, because the banks are very focused on the relationship depth. The banks are looking to say how do we broaden and deepen on an individual relationship level, because you want to make sure you’re secure with the relationships you already have, particularly in a difficult environment.</p>


<p><span>Caviezel (J.P. Morgan):</span> I would say corporates should be looking at the past couple of years as a training ground, and take those learnings and drive them into core competencies. I agree – as banks we should continue to promote open dialogue with corporates to enrich those relationships.  It’s actually quite interesting to see that the treasury services departments of larger financial institutions have enjoyed greater success at finding ways to help their clients implement more efficient cash management processes. So it’s again focusing on those core competencies and sharing best practice techniques and continuing to delve into a client’s challenges. That is something to do over the next 12 months.</p>


<p><span>Newman (Bank of America Merrill Lynch):</span> I used to think that what we went through in 2008 was the 100 year flood, and now I’m beginning to think it is the generation we’re facing. Some of that is because there is an inter-connectiveness between things globally, and so there’s a continual flow, but it’s rare in my banking lifetime, that you will have such a near term ability to apply lessons learned in a difficult time: typically that’s five, seven, ten years and so you’re thinking ‘What was it like in the early nineties?’ or ‘What happened, how did I behave the last time we went trough this?’ Now that’s just two years ago. And I really do think that we’re going to have the ability to apply those same lessons learned, and that’s what I would say, I think that’s what corporations are doing. I think applying lessons learned can only prove to be beneficial for us all.</p>


<p><span>Caulier (BNP Paribas):</span> For the year ahead, whether we get out of this crisis or not, funding and optimisation of processes will remain key. When we do get out of the crisis, companies will require substantial new cash to finance their operating cycle as sales pick up. Inventories, work in progress and receivables simply consume cash. It is therefore imperative to look at the full value chain, to put the heads together to find solutions, internally as well as externally. There is a huge role for the treasury, together with sales, production and procurement, to get the most cash out of the operating cycle. It is also the role of banks to come up with global solutions encompassing supplier finance, factoring, trade and cash management solutions.</p>


<p><span>Guralnick (Citi):</span> Without wanting to sound trite, it is all about our clients challenging us, and sharing their vision, goals and ambitions with us so that we can help them meet their objectives.

<p><span>Richard Parkinson (TT):</span> I want to start with the issue of credit. You are all selling cash management services, but cash management doesn’t stand alone and corporates expect some sort of credit support as part of that relationship. But bank balance sheets are under a lot of pressure as the financial markets deleverage and various forms of debt (actually these are assets to a bank) come back onto your balance sheets. So how are you meeting your customers’ credit requirements and what impact is this deleveraging having on the cash management business?</p>


<p><span>Robin Terry (HSBC):</span> Well the two items are intrinsically linked. We’ve seen what was a very normal relationship in terms of credit, turn into a special relationship. In our view, corporates are cherishing that relationship with their bank much more because of the lack of liquidity and credit there has been in the market.</p>
<p>The reduction in the number of banks that have available credit has reshaped bank lending groups. It’s also reshaped those players. You’re having to look at different transactional players that perhaps you didn’t see in the past in your credit groupings and then ask what that particular bank can do, especially in terms of the wallet share that’s available. Banks will say, “What can we lock into in terms of transactional banking to get the returns that we need on that scarce credit now and in the future?”</p>


<p><span>Marilyn Spearing (Deutsche Bank):</span> It’s interesting that that’s the mood – that credit is tight – and yet all of the bank stats show that there hasn’t really been a reduction in bank lending to the large corporate. The corporates’ concern as to whether they had access to credit was because the other markets were very much drying up.</p>
<p>I think that it’s a good balance that we’re reaching right now and we are seeing good, solid, honest discussions with clients on where this relationship is going. But the other impact is more providers. The wallet is getting fractured.</p>


<p><span>Michael Guralnick (Citi):</span> I think what we are seeing is a maturing of the overall relationship. The interconnectedness of annuity business to the provision of credit has always existed. The corporates have always told us that it’s very important, and actually they emphasise that even more so today in our dialogues. While that linkage existed we too are emphasising that from our side of the coin, returns matter as well, and for use of our capital we need to see improved returns, which leads to the cash management discussion.</p>
<p>For us at Citi’s Global Transaction Services it’s really about supporting those clients who can truly leverage and benefit from our globality, namely the scale that Citi has in terms of the international network and consistent global platforms. It’s about open client conversations where we discuss what we both expect of from our relationship, what is mutually beneficial.</p>


<p><span>Tarek F. Anwar (Standard Chartered):</span> I think the other way to look at this is to look at it from the clients’ perspective. Corporates are going to look at their internal working capital and they’re going to look at providers that actually can leverage that working capital in an integrated fashion. So your ability to take on additional risk, say buyer financing, helps the corporate with increasing their sales and stabilising the relationship with their buyers.</p>
<p>You’re also helping them with their suppliers, both using your balance sheet and your risk as well as picking up the cash management. So actually you’re rebalancing that risk return equation, not through just pricing but through provision of services which are complete.</p>
<p>That makes a lot of sense too from a corporate perspective, and then taking that across a multitude of different countries and not just doing it in one space. I think that’s valuable for the corporates.</p>


<p><span>Nicholas Blake (J.P. Morgan):</span> There is a significant amount of corporate refinancing due during the next 18 months. What we’re hearing is the pricing of risk wasn’t done well in the past which led to too much cheap credit in the system. There’s an acceptance from our clients as well as ourselves that we need to be smarter about the way we look at risk and how it is priced.</p>
<p>Clients are also exploring other funding sources. For instance, although the debt capital markets are coming back, we’re expecting more equity to finance corporates going forward. We’ve also seen a lot of our corporate clients looking at supplier and receivables financing techniques to supplement their existing capital markets programmes or in some cases replace them where they couldn’t get the rates or funding they were looking for.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Those capital markets are not open to corporates as before, are they? Some of the securitisation opportunities, or the originate and distribute models, are broken. But there is still the underlying demand for credit.</p>


<p><span>Anwar (Standard Chartered):</span> In addition to what I mentioned earlier on increased focus on internal working capital, actually I think that there is a shift, not all the banks and not all the corporates have yet realised.</p>
<p>If you look at a lot of discussions we’ve had with our clients in the US and in Europe, they are looking at Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa as their future areas of growth over the next ten to 15 years and therefore having the traditional revolver sitting in the US or in Europe, doesn’t really work for them.</p>
<p>So they’re looking at getting the funding for the growth on a local basis. You may not find the depth in these markets so it’s going to be quite interesting over the next three to five years because that shift is already happening.</p>


<figure class=""portrait left""><img alt=""Portrait of Marilyn Spearing"" height=""225"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2009/10/2009-10-tt-05-ttf-marilyn-spearing-200x225.jpg"" width=""200""/></figure>
<p><span>Spearing (Deutsche Bank):</span> Also, a big thing for us and something we see with our clients, is the whole concept around capital substitution. The ‘orginate to distribute’ model is still valid, particularly for trade finance. With the right assets there is the opportunity for us to sell down and create more capacity for our clients. On the trade side this has really worked out for us and for our clients that’s really put more liquidity into the system for them while they were able to optimise their own working capital as well.</p>


<p><span>Pierre Fersztand (BNP Paribas):</span> Today corporate clients are looking for liquidity from several business sectors: from capital markets, from traditional bank credit, from trade or from factoring. To manage their liquidity effectively, they focus on the banks which are reliable with strong capabilities and global reach.</p>
<p>In addition, they focus on the local market which is not a very domestic one but which is a regional one for Asia, for Europe and for America. It is more difficult today for a corporate to be financed by only one bank for the entire world, and to only use one instrument product. Corporates have definitely revised their investments policy.</p>


<p><span>Spearing (Deutsche Bank):</span> One last point I’d make is that this environment has been a catalyst for us on the trade side to look at collaboration for everyone around this table. A lot of us have shared clients and we are all thinking about how to best support the client’s needs, so we do this through club deals through trade syndication opportunities. I’ve seen a lot more of that and I think that’s positive thinking for the client at the end of the day.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> I’m hearing “Don’t underestimate the value of your transaction business in negotiating credit facilities”, but what else would you advise corporates to do?</p>


<p><span>Spearing (Deutsche Bank):</span> Diversify your sources. Do not rely on the old, traditional route, it’s a different time. Who can go to market and who can’t? And, if you can’t, how are you going to get that access to working capital?</p>


<p><span>Terry (HSBC):</span> And look at the timeline as well. What financing requirements do you have coming up in the next few years and how might you leverage transactional banking mandates in support of your request to your banking group? Timing is important.</p>


<p><span>Anwar (Standard Chartered):</span> I’d throw into the mix, the whole counter-party risk issue because that’s changed. I would put the corporate’s relationships with Banks, Buyers and Suppliers in that category. So just taking a fresh look at what the corporates are doing, given that they may have to lock in certain pieces for a given amount of time.</p>
<p>The other thing I would add to the counterparty area is that if you are looking at growth areas over the next three to five to 15 years, you may want to start to make sure that you have access in those markets to the right players and that’s critical because they might be very different than what you have in your home market today.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Does diversification also apply to one’s transactional banking group these days? Is it realistic for a corporate to think about global cash management with a single banking group any more or is that history?</p>


<p><span>Spearing (Deutsche Bank):</span> I am hearing only about the wake-up call on diversification and those that have been consolidating heavily are having to put in contingency measures to address business continuity and counterparty concerns. If they are overly concentrated with one or two, it’s a real scare.</p>


<figure class=""portrait left""><img alt=""Portrait of Michael Guralnick"" height=""225"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2009/10/2009-10-tt-05-ttf-michael-guralnick-200x225.jpg"" width=""200""/></figure>
<p><span>Guralnick (Citi):</span> I think that there is a continuation of a theme that we have seen for many years. The large multinationals have looked at a core banking group and they have for many years looked to split the world between that core bank group.</p>
<p>There are very few, if any, clients who award cash management global basis to one provider. As we said earlier, because of the linkage between credit and the need to reward credit banks, companies have divided the world amongst the key providers of capital who are also world-class cash management providers.</p>
<p>Clients may use some regional providers for collections, but they want to quickly upstream the cash that is possible into a global or regional pool to get visibility and access to their liquidity. They don’t want idle cash lying about, which necessitates going outside to use other sources of external credit.</p>
<p>So while I do think there is an evolution towards global cash management ‘system’ it is not necessarily with one bank; and this is driven by concentration, business continuity and counterparty risk concerns.</p>


<p><span>Fersztand (BNP Paribas):</span> From a risk, as well as from a credit perspective, Corporates are trying to find global players in one region and are, sometimes, scared of using local banks in some countries. But at the same time the idea of having only one bank in one continent has never really been realistic.</p>
<p>I have an example of a large corporate company that wanted to have only one bank for cash management in Europe but at the end of the year they decided to have two or three additional banks, which seems to be a more realistic number.</p>
<p>In Europe Corporates have found that payments and collections vary from one country to the other, for example the differences between Italy and Belgium. As such, they either seemed to choose two or three banks to cover a big region like Asia and Europe and to have one or two lead banks for their cash pooling and electronic banking solutions.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> So what is global cash management and how is it different from co-ordinated regional and sub-regional cash management?</p>


<p><span>Spearing (Deutsche Bank):</span> The way I’ve always rationalised this is around semantics. The treasurer has to decide what’s his philosophy on a global cash level and that’s really the start point. How much control does he want from the centre? How much visibility does he want and is he willing to then decentralise that? The philosophy that’s maintained at the global treasurer level to say, “Here’s how I want to do this because it is going to work for my company” and if he genuinely believes they are a multinational, they are going to still want global visibility and liquidity management at some level for core currencies.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Is this different from what we had a few years ago when we might have split the world region by region but if one region was cash-rich and another was cash-poor you would try and do something about that?</p>


<p><span>Anwar (Standard Chartered):</span> In the ideal world what they wanted was one pot of cash, in one currency, at the right time, globally. The reality is that companies are realising that their needs on the ground may have grown dramatically in certain markets which they used to sweep cash out of.</p>
<p>And they have realised the impact of pulling liquidity out of growth markets, causing difficulties with the forecasts, local balance sheets, taxes, etc. So they’re beginning to say “Are there specific regional requirements that I have in my plans going forward that I would need to keep the liquidity in place?” You have to be aware of the practicalities of what the business wants and needs are going forward.</p>


<p><span>Terry (HSBC):</span> We’ve seen a lot of corporates moving towards one ERP system globally. But they’re all moving at different stages and as some of them have invested very heavily in the ERP system, they are also having to change their treasury management system to the same provider. This all means they can then look at things that they’ve never considered before – perhaps in-house banks or Shared Services Centres.</p>
<p>So, it’s changing. I don’t think you can really say there is one model that exists out there – there is a series of different models that are used in different corporate environments to meet the individual requirements of that company.</p>


<figure class=""portrait left""><img alt=""Portrait of Pierre Fersztand"" height=""225"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2009/10/2009-10-tt-05-ttf-pierre-fersztand-200x225.jpg"" width=""200""/></figure>
<p><span>Fersztand (BNP Paribas):</span> I agree with this because Cash Management “is differences”, it includes a wide range of needs such as liquidity management, global visibility, payments and collections. Which are fundamentally basically different things. Priorities have changed and to have more and more global visibility is certainly one of them.</p>
<p>But what has also changed is the idea that complexity would almost disappear. Now everyone recognises that in most countries a lot of means of payments are still not STP and are quite complex. They need to have banks with local capabilities, not only for notes and coins, but for most of their payments.</p>
<p>At the same time the processes can be more harmonised because there are some banks that are very good in local markets, so you can rely on them and you have technology that can allow you to have a smooth process with different banks in the world. So things have gone in the right direction which is more global banks with deep local markets at the same time, visibility and technology. But the complexity of the real world is more intricate than we could have hoped.</p>


<p><span>Anwar (Standard Chartered):</span> One of the things Pierre is saying is visibility. I think we also need to consider visibility of what? Because if you’re in treasury you’re looking at liquidity. But, if you look at other stakeholders inside the corporate and ask “Who needs what information and what role does the bank play?”, you then have to go back to the clearing system and ask whether it supports the requirement? Does the bank have the information before it goes to the clearing system? In many emerging markets there’s an evolution that’s happening in some of the clearing systems that may or may not allow that information to be passed to the bank, and then the question is whether the bank is able to pass that on quickly enough for the client.</p>


<p><span>Guralnick (Citi):</span> Well that’s interesting because I had a client yesterday saying “I have a global cash management system” and that really is around governance, control and the approach they take. They have a common global standard for their ERP system and they believe they have got the information they need.</p>
<p>I do think that it’s sort of back to the future. People were thinking about one bank globally for all cash management, but now they’re re-examining the model. They are looking at a connected system having one provider in Asia, one in the Middle East, or two maximum per region – it depends on the region and the complexity and the bank’s footprint and capabilities.</p>
<p>However, for treasury payments many clients would still like a single overlay bank to upstream liquidity as fast as possible. For the nuts and bolts of local collections, payments and payroll, they may use a number of banks depending on capabilities.</p>
<p>They would then like to tie that cash management activity to some of the new innovations in analytics in the marketplace. There is a lot of banking data out there but clients do not have the staff to sift through mounds of paper looking for information. Not everybody has a treasury workstation. We provide the analytical tools such as Treasury Vision to convert data to value-added information to manage their businesses.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Now turning to Europe and SEPA what is going to be delivered and when?</p>


<p><span>Fersztand (BNP Paribas):</span> The SEPA Credit Transfer exists and the growth of SEPA Credit Transfer versus the other credit transfers is very slow. The advice that I could give to corporates is to migrate to SEPA Credit Transfer according to their own agenda. In the end, the SEPA credit transfer will become widespread but for those who have not made a strong change it will be quite a smooth transition because it will only be another format and banks will provide format conversion anyway.</p>
<p>SEPA Direct Debit is a big change, it’s a change of responsibilities in the way of dealing with the mandate for the consumers. SEPA Direct Debit concerns relative less numerous number of corporates and all consumers so it will be a strong change. This change will be made in the next years but it will be done with good information for consumers and country by country.</p>
<p>For instance, in France it has been decided that 2010 will be the year of consumer information and the live date will be at the end of 2010 and no longer at the end of 2009. In Italy it will be done end of 2010 or beginning of 2011. In Belgium, they will begin very early towards the end of 2009 or beginning of 2010. So corporates have to fit with the agenda of each main country because in the end it will be a transfer of the means of payment and it will be a very good evolution.</p>


<p><span>Spearing (Deutsche Bank):</span> The discussions are all around the banks looking for an end date for domestic schemes. If there is an end date approaching the corporates have to be doing an impact assessment and they can be factoring that in right now. So this is one of those radar items. There is a long-term benefit and although the business case looks sketchy right now, it is inevitable. We will be marching towards a common format across all the countries, so corporates have to factor that in. My guess is something like 2013 for those end dates.</p>
<p>The banking industry is incurring the cost of dual track (clearing systems) and that isn’t going to be sustainable. The banks don’t usually like regulation but we are looking at regulation to structure the end date of the dual track and that makes sense.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> But the poor old corporate is saying “what benefits does it give me?” You’ll be closing systems that work very well.</p>


<p><span>Spearing (Deutsche Bank):</span> We’ve got solid business cases from clients we’re working with and it’s all around the things that treasurers want to do, which is efficiency. It’s about cost reduction rationalisation of systems which they can filter in so they should start now to agree the new formats, start to move towards ISO20022.</p>


<figure class=""portrait left""><img alt=""Portrait of Robin Terry"" height=""225"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2009/10/2009-10-tt-05-ttf-robin-terry-200x225.jpg"" width=""200""/></figure>
<p><span>Terry (HSBC):</span> For the last three to five years corporates have been putting in traditional European cash management structures, therefore the hesitation is understandable. “I’ve just finished all of that and now you want me to re-engineer some of this again as a result of new pan-European payment instruments being available. Maybe I need to have a set of accounts in one centre to make my payments from and maybe another set of accounts for collection in local centres.” The structure of this is very important and will differ corporate by corporate.</p>
<p>But SEPA is coming. It is not going to stop, so corporates have to start looking now at where this is going and they need to start planning what’s going on with their IT infrastructure and their subsidiaries across Europe to start gradually filtering this in.</p>
<p>I think the banks can help in some way with that because gradually we can redirect ‘the pipe’ so you have minimal changes but you can still start using the new instruments; SEPA Credit Transfer and SEPA Direct Debit when it comes in later this year and next.</p>
<p>Once we’ve got some end dates in the frame for legacy clearing systems to close, and I think once the public sector in Europe start getting some movement in using SEPA rather than domestic clearings, then that’s when the volume will start to move and then we’re on a very fast slope.</p>


<p><span>Blake (J.P. Morgan):</span> Common processing across Europe is going to benefit the corporate when it becomes standard. There is value to both banks and corporates but it’s very clear so far that the benefits haven’t fully been recognised or achieved. More understanding about the future of the existing clearing systems and in particular their retirement, will help sharpen the focus for banks and corporates alike.</p>
<p>Those clients that are re-engineering now should absolutely think about it as part of that process because they have the opportunity and the ability to do it. For those who don’t necessarily have a reason for re-engineering yet, they should be looking at the future growth plans of their organisation, how they will need to adapt to support them and look to ensure this is included in the review.</p>


<p><span>Guralnick (Citi):</span> They just don’t have clarity on that end date and if you look at direct debits for Spain it will still require you to use the local Spanish clearing system because of central bank reporting requirements. Until governments decide this is important to their consumers and corporates and overall business activity it is probably not going to progress as quickly as we would have initially thought. Many companies who implemented BIC and IBANs are now saying ‘I’ve got a lot of things on my plate right now and I’m going to wait and see.’ That’s what one client said yesterday. ‘We’re teed up but we’re not going to hit the ball yet.’</p>


<p><span>Blake (J.P. Morgan):</span> We’ve seen an increased interest for SEPA Direct Debit. The value it can bring to the utility and other B2C sectors will be substantial.</p>


<p><span>Fersztand (BNP Paribas):</span> There would certainly be a lot of value in SEPA Direct Debit because collections are more difficult for corporates and more important than payments. The other thing is that in the collections field we will see legacy, non-SEPA payments for many years to come.</p>
<p>So it’s very important for corporates to move progressively towards more automated and more cross-border solutions in Europe. The first one is SEPA, the other one is to choose two or three European banks to cover all the domestic markets in Europe. So it is a combination of what we have said before, and of SEPA giving value to the corporate.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> I’d like to move on to talk about connectivity and, in particular, SWIFT corporate connectivity. ISO20022 is being described as the solution to SWIFT connectivity issues in much the same way that advocates of EDI talked a few years ago. What, if anything, is different this time around?</p>


<p><span>Spearing (Deutsche Bank):</span> Because it’s sponsored by SWIFT it has a greater chance of getting acceptability because it’s managed under the SWIFT guidelines, that means the banks are buying into it. We benefit if there is a community agreement and I think it has got as good a hope as any.</p>


<p><span>Terry (HSBC):</span> HSBC is very focused on SWIFT for Corporates. We’ve seen lots of interest from customers who have looked at their legacy systems and proprietary bank connections and the high costs associated with running and maintaining them.</p>
<p>I visit some clients where I go into a room and they’ve still got all those legacy workstations lined up around it, with little signs above them saying the names of the banks! That has to change. Even in a shared service centre where they’ve ‘lifted and shifted’ operations, you can still get this type of room with multiple legacy connections.</p>
<p>An increasingly important part of this is being able to utilise SWIFT for liquidity management, whereby corporates can take funds directly out of their accounts rather than through traditional bi-lateral arrangements between banks to forward MT101s.</p>
<p>If you add in the option to use a SWIFT bureau, where costs are considerably lower than traditional methods of joining SWIFT, add a lot of value added services off the back of the bureau, then the arguments become quite compelling. With FIN and FileAct and some of the new services that are coming up, now really is the time for considering SWIFT.</p>


<p><span>Anwar (Standard Chartered):</span> It’s actually yet another form of evolution – it’s an evolution from when banks insisted on their own proprietary systems as an advantage to protect other players from coming in. That evolution will continue and, as you say, the costs will come down and the value will go up.</p>


<p><span>Fersztand (BNP Paribas):</span> There is a real value for corporates because SWIFTNet offers to corporates one multi-bank solution for all their entities. Which means that you can have five efficient banks in a region and just one process. BNP Paribas has been very supportive to corporates connecting through SWIFT because it was very close to our model. It has been a bit slow at the beginning because SWIFT had to move from the bank world to the corporates world which is a big change. Today the connectivity costs are going down.</p>
<p>What I also see with corporates even if they move to SWIFT-land, even if they use host-to-host solutions between the bank and their ERP systems, they are very happy to have the bank channel apart from this to send one treasury message and to have one kind of reporting that is very easy to use. A lot of people in the company however don’t have access to the ERP so there is a future for our proprietary internet-based systems, which is complementary to the host-to-host SWIFT connection.</p>


<p><span>Terry (HSBC):</span> Another question is “Does it really deliver full interchangability between banks?” Maybe I’m out on a limb on this one but it’s all about messaging and formatting standards. It’s about XML and its abilities to deliver much more robust messaging. It’s also about the security around that messaging. Banks will need to adapt to accept this new format and away from more traditional file types.</p>
<p>Clients who are working with multiple banks don’t necessarily want to have proprietary systems, although part of what the proprietary system brings are analytical tools. It’s about information – robust information that I can make decisions on. Proprietary systems – will they just wither over time and die? Probably not. There will be a segment of the market place that these work for in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>There are degrees of sophistication amongst the client base. SWIFT connectivity is a viable, valuable tool to provide clients with the capability to reach multiple banks and HSBC very much see it as an emerging trend going forward.</p>


<p><span>Spearing (Deutsche Bank):</span> Yes – and it is literally the messaging. We are tidying up the messaging but it’s still allowing the banks to differentiate on what they do which is network...</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Yes but the corporate can now reach out across the globe using the technology.</p>


<figure class=""portrait left""><img alt=""Portrait of Tarek F. Anwar"" height=""225"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2009/10/2009-10-tt-05-ttf-tarek-anwar-200x225.jpg"" width=""200""/></figure>
<p><span>Anwar (Standard Chartered):</span> Well I’m not sure I totally agree with that. I still think their primary relationship with the banks that give them that global reach will work. The issue is going to be where they have gaps with that relationship and the need to fill them in.</p>
<p>They may now have an easier option to reach out to and work with somebody else. From their point of view it is going to be the relationship, it is going to be the credit, it is going to be the counterparty risk, it’s even knowledge of the culture of the company. How much does the bank know and understand? That’s probably more important than just tools.</p>


<p><span>Guralnick (Citi):</span> On the point of global reach, at the end of the day it’s about people, and a client doesn’t do business with SWIFT. They do their commercial business; they’re importing, they’re exporting, they’re moving goods across borders in many cases.</p>
<p>What they need are people on the ground who can help them with the myriad of financial requirements they have from customs guarantees, to dealing with tax or regulatory reporting issues, and so on.</p>
<p>This business activity is separate from the information messaging piece and the connectivity of one’s network. The ability to have a network of people on the ground will still be valued by clients.</p>


<p><span>Spearing (Deutsche Bank):</span> But it is a value decision for the corporate. If they want to achieve their reach by going direct to each one of those counterpoints, SWIFT should facilitate that, right? So, as long as they want to open up and have the accounts and have that relationship in 70 odd countries as opposed to going to one, two, three or four banks as we spoke about.</p>


<p><span>Fersztand (BNP Paribas):</span> In each country the clients need to have a core bank, a bank with reachability, a bank that a client wants to work with and to bank with, and not only for cash management. But at the same time, in most countries a lot of clients need to have a deep offer, whether you are in Morocco or elsewhere, you need a wide range of capabilities. Then the client has the choice: either they pay with an internet tool in this country where the global bank has reachability, but not a very strong offer – or they take a local bank which has a very bad internet tool, and becomes very difficult to manage.</p>
<p>It is really an extra choice for the client: finding equilibrium between global and local bank services.</p>


<p><span>Terry (HSBC):</span> I think it’s about providing that extra flexibility we talked about earlier. We see some clients that are actually switching away from that regional model of “I’m going to choose one bank for Europe and one bank for Asia” and they’re actually going to take say, one bank for five or six countries in a region and they’re not going to choose other countries where that bank may be weaker. They would then choose another bank which is stronger and mix and match it between the two. Having a common channel like SWIFT allows them to do that in a much easier way than they would have done in the past.</p>


<figure class=""portrait left""><img alt=""Portrait of Nicholas Blake"" height=""225"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2009/10/2009-10-tt-05-ttf-nicholas-blake-200x225.jpg"" width=""200""/></figure>
<p><span>Blake (J.P. Morgan):</span> For the things we have talked about SWIFT can act as the facilitator, but the banks will always differentiate on the service they can provide, whether that be from a relationship, quality or capability standpoint.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> We have been talking about using SWIFT for basic messaging, which is making transfers and getting statements, but there is also talk of electronic bank account management. What is this all about?</p>


<p><span>Spearing (Deutsche Bank):</span> Well, at first glance it’s about providing account information and billing type of information across the SWIFT network. This was on the corporate wish list. That’s where it started. Then it morphed into ‘wouldn’t it be great to be able to do bank account opening and, if you’re going to do bank account openings electronically, you need some sort of SWIFT messaging to communicate securely with the bank.’</p>
<p>Now you’re down to digital identity because with all of the bank proprietary technology, it’s personal, not just at a corporate level. We know the person authorised to make certain transactions.</p>
<p>Well, SWIFT isn’t personal. SWIFT operates at corporate identity level so it’s SWIFT’s security. So therefore if we’re going to extend this into the corporate world then they will look – as in France, and with all of our proprietary channels – right down to individuals, as to who’s authorised to do what. We all have first authoriser, second authoriser – it’s a different level of security and a different type of infrastructure.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Whereas the way the banks work on SWIFT is if the bank sends the message then it’s assumed it’s OK. So at what point is the checking of identity and approval going to be done then?</p>


<p><span>Spearing (Deutsche Bank):</span> Well, the proposal is to look at a personal digital identity for corporates that would allow each of the banks to get the best of what they’ve already invested in but make it interoperable. That’s what SWIFT is working on right now.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> So the message would come through with a personal identity attached and then the bank at the other end would check that personal identity is X from ABC Co approved to do this? The bank will be doing the checking?</p>


<p><span>Spearing (Deutsche Bank):</span> That’s the problem because you have to keep the liability for that digital confirmation at bank level. You can’t develop it in SWIFT. It would be too broad and too much liability within the SWIFT organisation.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> At the moment any corporate using SWIFT is effectively having to do their own internal policing. Because at the point in which they send the message down, you assume at the other end it’s properly authorised because you can’t tell who pressed the buttons.</p>


<p><span>Spearing (Deutsche Bank):</span> That’s right.</p>


<p><span>Anwar (Standard Chartered):</span> The issue is, if we try to handle the mandates electronically, and all the account opening documentation, is all the authorities that come along with that. Is it acceptable from a legal standpoint and a regulatory standpoint? I think that’s going to be the bigger challenge.</p>


<p><span>Fersztand (BNP Paribas):</span> Digital identity and EBAM (Electronic Bank Account Management) are two different projects – both of them very important. The habit in France is to use digital identity to confirm payments, to confirm files and to deal with the relationship between the bank and the client and to pay taxes for the corporate.</p>
<p>So the fact that SWIFT can bring us a group of products is very important for us. We’re also part of Identrust, but we think that SWIFT is the better vehicle for world-wide standardisation.</p>
<p>For EBAM, the subject is different because it’s new. Today bank account management is not STP at all, it’s only papers. The Corporates send us papers to manage their bank accounts and we send them back papers to confirm their instructions.</p>
<p>With these practices, sometimes, they do not even know how many accounts they have in the world and who has the account authorisation for each type of transaction. So, I think that EBAM is definately a great improvement that we have for the coming years.</p>
<p>And to become STP, processes and messages need to be standardised in all the banks. We are very optimistic and very much convinced by EBAM.</p>


<p><span>Blake (J.P. Morgan):</span> EBAM is a good thing which has been welcomed by the corporate. I think though, most of us round this table are already providing some form of electronic account information exchange. SWIFT can become that enabler again to make this a multi-bank opportunity.</p>


<p><span>Guralnick (Citi):</span> We talked about change management earlier, which in treasury was mainly focused around re-engineering many of the treasury processes to automate and streamline them. In the middle of re-engineering their treasury management processes, many companies still deal with the most archaic basic process, account opening in a manual (paper-based) fashion.</p>
<p>This is the most basic banking activity, where clients and banks still exchange paper-based documents, use wet signatures to sign authorisation cards for control etc., little to no re-engineering has taken place with respect to account management. As a result, the maintenance of bank accounts today is still archaic. However, we are now introducing new modern techniques to improve work-flow management, specifically around the use of digital identity signatures to support electronic bank account management (EBAM).</p>
<p>One client said, “If you’re going to help me re-engineer my treasury processes, then start by helping me re-engineer my work-flow, around account documentation management and account maintenance which is really the most basic activity I do with a bank and takes a tremendous amount of time and cost.”</p>
<p>EBAM is a collaborative space between clients and the banks. It has to be, because this isn’t a proprietary activity at all. EBAM is all about efficiency and cost management for us and our clients across the industry. I do think SWIFT does have a role to play in this but what that role is, is still being defined.</p>


<p><span>Spearing (Deutsche Bank):</span> There’s plenty of opportunity to move in a co-ordinated way but it does need to be co-ordinated because right now each one of us has sometimes customised based on our ten largest clients’ needs for example. Everyone’s in violent agreement; but my worry is what is the most important bit? Account opening to some clients, well SWIFT tell me, “that’s not a big thing – that’s really high-end multinational” or bank account statements? “It’s not that critical of an issue”.</p>
<p>Right now I think there’s a view that SWIFT has to do more and we’re not certain how to prioritise some of that. With a number of conferences coming up in the autumn, that will give us some views on all of this.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> What are your concluding recommendations to readers of this piece?</p>


<p><span>Blake (J.P. Morgan):</span> SWIFT looks like becoming a key component that many corporates are looking for. We’ve talked about SWIFT as an enabler for payment standards, information exchange, digital identity. I think the banks all trust SWIFT because we have a stake in the business.</p>
<p>It’s been core to the financial institution industry for some years now, and from a corporate perspective, for those that haven’t perhaps looked at SWIFT and what the banks are doing in that space – it’s worth starting to think about it. At the end of the day, it’s all about choice, it makes sense for some but maybe not for others.</p>


<p><span>Terry (HSBC):</span> I think it’s a very exciting time for the corporate coming up in the next couple of years. We’ve got increasing flexibility; we’ve got increasing new options coming up; we’ve got new markets like SEPA Direct Debit coming up.</p>
<p>This is the time when they can actually really make a difference by using these tools and working with their banks and advisors to make changes and really make a difference in their business. I think it’s a great time for them to be looking at some of these new instruments and services.</p>


<p><span>Guralnick (Citi):</span> We talked about credit at the very start. I’m not sure the markets will go back to the sort of easy liquidity state we saw over the last five years. The one piece of advice is really around working capital. I think there’s a lot more to do to extract liquidity out of the receivables process, to look at suppliers and ensure you’ve got good connectivity through your supply chain and ensuring stability. Previously who would have imagined that working capital management was a top priority for the CFO or the CEO, but it absolutely is now.</p>
<p>When you can’t go to the markets to either raise capital or borrow, then looking at the inefficiencies in your working capital cycle to extract liquidity takes a very prominent role on the C-suite agenda. I urge all our clients to continue down that path because there is a lot more value they can extract. All of us offer working capital tools and platforms that can help them help themselves.</p>


<p><span>Spearing (Deutsche Bank):</span> I think that if I had one final statement, I would give the action plan to the corporate. There is so much change occurring, now is the time to factor in that vision that we talked about for global cash management and say right, how would I really prioritise the changes that are occurring? How will I use them and when? Do you really have that action plan? This is a very good time to be doing it given technology changes, given economic changes and given the need for all of them to get smarter and faster and more efficient.</p>


<p><span>Anwar (Standard Chartered):</span> I’d just like to add that this is the time to actually have the conversation with your bank about how to look at your structure. There is no better time than now to re-examine it, and see if there are internal or external hurdles from making change. It’s also much better for the corporate really to stop using the banks language and rather continue to use their own language. I’ve seen a lot of corporates adopt words from the banks and a lot gets lost in translation.</p>
<p>I actually prefer to hear it in their own words because then you can understand what they are trying to accomplish. The banks can then really help them by focussing on the priorities. OK, is that practical? Does this make sense? What’s the reality? Can we change it together? So they have to be able to sift through that.</p>


<p><span>Fersztand (BNP Paribas):</span> I think that corporates ought to fit to their own agenda is the first piece of advice because there are so many things changing in the technology and the banking world. The company’s own agenda has to be their priority. Not to change priorities according to one piece of advice or one technology.</p>
<p>The most important thing is that the treasurer is able to build his own agenda. The bank can help the treasurer explain why this agenda is important for the company and convince other colleagues to follow the same objectives.</p>
<p>Now more than ever it is important to try to centralise and to keep costs down. There are several ways to do this and all of them are good but everyone has to agree to have the same aim within the company.</p>


<p><span>Blake (J.P. Morgan):</span> One final point is that in addition to the cost of the changing payment landscape with SEPA, there’s going to be a significant amount of regulatory change going forward to deal with, such as the Payments Services Directive.</p>
<p>It (transaction banking) is an expensive business to be in. I think the banks in this room plus maybe a couple of others are likely to be the consolidators in the industry going forward. To continue investing in this business you have to have a long-term strategy that makes sense and is aligned with what your clients are going to need.</p>
<p>From a corporate perspective you should be thinking very carefully about your bank group. Not simply from a simple counterparty perspective, but who are going to be the long-term players in this industry? Who do you select to work with now that has the appetite to deliver what you need?</p>

<p><span>Richard Parkinson (TT):</span> The supply chain has been one of the leading topics at conferences and the subject of many articles over the last year or so. I wanted to start by asking you all what you are seeing going on in the supply chain space right now.</p>


<p><span>Alberto Amo Mena (Santander):</span> My impression is that in most of Europe there is still more noise and publicity than significant supply chain finance volumes being handled in platforms or products under development by banks or other players. On the other hand, in Spain, supply chain finance is highly developed, with about 9% of GDP being paid through such solutions. So market penetration in Spain is greater than any other geography. Santander’s Factoring subsidiary pioneered this market as long ago as 1990 when it introduced Confirming<sup>®</sup> as a form of reverse factoring.</p>
<p>Over the years, Confirming<sup>®</sup> has been refined, web-enabled and has become increasingly sophisticated. This product has gradually been adopted by other financial entities in Spain to the point that more than 15 institutions are now offering a Confirming<sup>®</sup> solution. Similarly, Confirming<sup>®</sup> has been successfully exported to countries where Spanish banks have expanded their branch networks, such as Portugal and Latin America. Over the last few years supply chain finance has been a hot topic internationally, which is great news for Santander, given our deep expertise in this field, providing us with an opportunity to offer our solutions in a growing range of countries and enrich the solution’s cross-border capabilities.</p>


<p><span>Jan Dirk van Beusekom (Fortis):</span> We see various solutions offered in the market also in the northern countries. However it’s very fragmented and at Fortis, we put those fragments together and take a more holistic view including cash management and commercial finance and not only taking the trade side of the supply chain. Obviously there’s been a lot of changes in the trade business, automation of the processes and moving from letters of credit and documentary credits to open account trading. The challenge is to create visibility of the total chain and to combine the different elements of the solution. That’s one of the reasons why we are looking at the flow side of all these different moments in the life of a trade or transaction.</p>


<p><span>Anne Collard (LTSB):</span> I think it can be as fragmented on the corporate side as on the banking side. The challenge for the banks is trying to understand what the corporates are looking for and what we should be offering.</p>
<p>Sometimes you find supply chains have been developed where the corporates have been working together, the automotive industry for example. In this model, the banks have been disintermediated and the corporates can cherry pick the elements they want to do – including financing, for example.</p>
<p>So I think the banks are trying to understand where they can add value and how they can then start to understand the opportunities available by bringing together the physical and financial supply chains to deliver greater value. They’re getting better at doing that through initiatives such as SWIFT’s TSU. </p>

<p><span>David Hennah (SWIFT):</span> From a SWIFT perspective, a lot of the publicity attached to what SWIFT has been doing over the last couple of years has been in relation to the development and launch of the TSU, but that neglects the reality that SWIFT has a broader trade and supply chain strategy that addresses other aspects of the business.</p>
<p>Just to mention a couple of other things, one is we’ve done a certain amount of research into the usage of our traditional trade messages for letters of credit, collections and guarantees, consulting not only with banks, but also with corporates and software vendors. There is work going on at the moment to extend the usage of some of those messages, for example to support LC Advice, LC Amendment and LC Application messages into the corporate-to-bank and bank-to-corporate space. So that’s one activity. The other one is e-invoicing, where I think there is a huge amount of potential to introduce improvements into the supply chain. So we’re keeping a watching brief there, participating in the EU Experts Group, looking at proposals for ISO standardisation. SWIFT is taking a broader perspective on all of this. Everything is inter-related and it’s important to keep a coherent approach.</p>


<p><span>Axel-Peter Ohse (Deutsche Bank):</span> As banks, we seem to have looked too much into just financing. When it comes to the cost side, it’s just the interest rate and the interest cost, etc, that we have traditionally been concerned with. And only recently have I seen approaches where we try to go back to the physical supply chain and figure out the various trigger points in order to make up our minds where, as bankers, we can actually link in.</p>
<p>We have several products and services that already exist at the bank which we can appropriately link into the supply chain. And, on top of this, pockets of new services which can potentially be developed to meet demand. Coming from the risk side, we are building up advisory services on the basis of which we are now able to sell cash management, supply chain finance products and related services in a much more integrated way.</p>
<p>Once you cross into the corporate sector you really need project management skills to get these things across and get them implemented.</p>


<p><span>van Beusekom (Fortis):</span> A lot of banks are still looking at the relationship with only the CFO or the Treasurer and it’s very much credit based. We at Fortis initiate discussions with the procurement manager, the sales manager and the financial director to be able to include all angles of the supply chain in a company. We have been doing this in the commodities business for decades and are expanding that practice to other segments and industries.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“As banks, we seem to have looked too much into just financing. When it comes to the cost side, it’s just the interest rate and the interest cost, etc, that we have traditionally been concerned with.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>Ohse (Deutsche Bank):</span> An interesting experience for me was that whenever I would talk to clients, I’d tried to figure out their counterparty risk assessment procedures. And the result is that more than 80% have some sort of counterparty assessment capabilities – which is quite good – and if not, they generally outsource this. Now, when you switch over to the liability side of the balance sheet: how do you score suppliers? Who has a supplier scoring system? Who measures suppliers’ sustainability? One out of five? One out of seven?</p>
<p>Talking about supply chain finance and related risk within financial supply chain management, it all starts with a qualification process. If you don’t have a reasonable qualification process on the corporate side, it’s very difficult to assess the end-to-end process – and this is surely credit relevant.</p>


<p><span>David Aldred (J.P. Morgan):</span> I agree. We work with companies and focus on their diminished value risk. That is, the value of the underlying contract and the financial risk if they were to miss their target delivery date. For example, if a manufacturer of shoes is late getting their product distributed and onto the shelf, they might miss or certainly be late for a particular season – there is not as much demand for boots in summer! So what impact does that have on that stock value? The missed sale opportunity, a stock surplus that will probably need to be discounted, and the missed opportunity of sale accessories – polish, laces, socks, etc.</p>
<p>Clients have asked why J.P. Morgan is involved in this area and why should they not utilise a consultant or niche supply chain company? My answer is, because of our experience and daily exposure in the traditional trade business. We know our way around the documentation side and we know about the movement of goods on a global basis. It’s simply a logical extension to provide advisory services to help clients have an efficient supply chain.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“If a manufacturer is late getting their product distributed and onto the shelf, they might miss a particular season.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Do you charge for that advice?</p>


<p><span>Aldred (J.P. Morgan):</span> Absolutely. It’s all part of the value add we bring, so it’s all about looking at the wider solution that you can offer to the client and the significant savings you can help them make.</p>


<p><span>Ohse (Deutsche Bank):</span> We run specific risk advisory services. The big difference between a professional risk consultancy and a relationship manager, who in the past used to provide some sort of risk advisory, is that you provide a specialist to the corporate and that gives you reason enough to ask for a fee. That’s number one. Number two, you build a track record for reference purposes. And third, on the basis of risk advisory, you get a wealth of information from your client in a much more structured way than you got it in the past. The art is basically to take that type of information and convert it into business opportunities.</p>
<p>Where you can make money is where you can create value for your client and also for yourselves. And this is very, very different compared to some years ago.</p>


<p><span>Aldred (J.P. Morgan):</span> The complexities of dealing with this on a global basis are a challenge for any company, particularly for a medium sized one that does not have a centralised business.</p>
<p>Take the defence industry as an example and the strict process they have to adhere to in exporting goods. The regulations around this are intensive and the penalties for non-adherence are severe and rightly so as no-one would want their goods falling into the wrong hands. But who is willing to take on that risk? Banks are used to taking risks. They are used to operating on a global basis and we see that as a natural extension of traditional trade flows to assist clients.</p>
<p>Yes, we’re competing with consultants in that space but I think to Axel’s point, as long as you can demonstrate the value, be it bottom line to a CFO, then there is a budget there for clients to pay for those services.</p>

<p><span>Collard (LTSB):</span> Doesn’t it also depend on how the customer would want to pay for those services? – because there are challenges around consulting fees. It’s sometimes not within a corporate’s budget, but if consulting is considered as part of a solution, which will have to be implemented, I think that’s where banks can add a lot more value.</p>
<p>If you take this view, then you’re not just looking at the financial supply chain, you’re looking at the total relationship. By addressing the whole value chain for the customer, you’ve got elements right the way along where, as a transactional services bank, we are able to add significant value. And I think that’s where, both strategically and tactically, the banks can start to give much more help to their customers.</p>


<p><span>van Beusekom (Fortis):</span> And being a partner, it’s always a balance between relationship banking and asking fees for certain advice. Either you have to really be very specific about it, or get reward for that advice in a different way.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> The current economic environment must be encouraging companies to look at supply chain management and working capital management.</p>


<p><span>Ohse (Deutsche Bank):</span> The reason why I think that corporates are more receptive to the idea is that the credit crunch presses people to start thinking about alternative funding sources. And also to think about alternative funding partners, such as banks which can employ a balance sheet actively – which is very good news in the current climate.</p>
<p>It’s bad news for (investment) banks which thought to provide an ABS structure behind a vendor solution because it appears that in the current market environment, there is limited investor appetite for ABS structures that aren’t currently working well.</p>


<p><span>Aldred (J.P. Morgan):</span> What we’re seeing, is that companies are looking internally at where they can squeeze working capital and liquidity out of their system. It’s not just a case of reducing DSO and increasing DPO. You can’t just do that because you have relationships with your suppliers. So workflow management is around creating efficiency and companies are listening because banks have been doing this for some time, particularly around the order to pay and purchase to cash processes, ERPs and traditional shared service centres and payment factories.</p>


<p><span>Hennah (SWIFT):</span> Supply chain is where the money is. It accounts for between 60% and 90% of all company costs. The larger corporates, the multinationals and particularly those that have implemented centralised treasury operations or shared services centres, have grasped not only the concept of supply chain management, but also the actual practice of supply chain management. As more and more mid-market companies get involved in low cost country sourcing, then they need to grasp the nettle as well.</p>
<p>But the focus has been more on the logistics side rather than on the financial side and that’s where the link still needs to be made in terms of process efficiency and liquidity management. And this is where the TSU, for example, can help.</p>


<p><span>Collard (LTSB):</span> There’s a growing recognition of the savings that can be made as well. Some of the customers we’re working with on our supplier finance solutions, had expectations of working capital benefits at the beginning which are half what they’ve actually realised, a third of the way into getting suppliers on board.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Supplier finance always seems to be one of the services that a lot of banks talk about. But is it anything more than just leaning on the buyers’ credit worthiness?</p>


<figure class=""portrait left""><img alt=""Portrait of Alberto Amo Mena"" height=""225"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2008/10/2008-10-tt-05-ttf-alberto-amo-mena-200x225.jpg"" width=""200""/>

</figure>
<p><span>Amo Mena (Santander):</span> Supplier finance is much more than just leveraging the buyer’s credit worthiness. The whole approach is more efficient in terms of risk analysis and industrial scale processes, such as handling electronic files, STP bulk payments, automated reconciliation of invoices financed and settled. In other words the complete life cycle of invoice approval and settlement for both the buyer and supplier. Regarding risk management, I would put less emphasis on a buyer’s credit worthiness and greater focus on his access to credit. This is an important nuance, since the amount of credit access is important as well as the price differential. These are key benefits that can be shared along the supply chain, improving working capital for buyers and suppliers.</p>


<p><span>van Beusekom (Fortis):</span> The driver next to funding and liquidity is reducing costs, and it’s not only in that bit where you are financing on top of the credit rating of the buyer. If you extend it another step, you’re talking to the buyer and all the suppliers. Think about including all buyers of the buyer and the suppliers of the supplier. There’s a lot to gain and especially in providing information we, as banks, have on transactions. You add a lot more value which deviates, in fact, from the purely supply chain finance bit between one buyer and a lot of suppliers, and using its credit rating to finance those suppliers. We firmly believe that information is the principal link between the physical and the financial supply chain.</p>


<p><span>Aldred (J.P. Morgan):</span> And information flows, let’s not forget, that’s what banks are good at. Providing information and, if you can, show the value between linking a treasurer and, say, a procurement officer, you can give them visibility over the entire order to pay process. Do you make that payment early? Do you accelerate it or do you give a discount? Each of these may have a different financial impact depending on their relationship with the supplier and the value of the transaction. By giving them the information, they can make an informed decision.</p>


<p><span>Collard (LTSB):</span> If you’re working on that basis, you can start forecasting some of the flows and the pro-activity around some of those flows, which provides a stronger foundation for managing risk.</p>


<p><span>Ohse (Deutsche Bank):</span> Let me try to explain it with an example. You have an OEM with a supplier and a pre-supplier in the chain. Each of these three parties banks with a different bank. Every party walks up to its banker and asks for funding separately. And, just for the sake of that example, say everybody has a financial requirement of 100, so the final product value is 300, once it’s finalised to go out of the OEM’s door. Now the pre-supplier gets from his bank 60, the supplier gets 80 and the OEM gets 200 – a lot more than he actually needs. The other parties get less than they actually need.</p>
<p>Now, ideally the CFO of the OEM – who could be in command of financing and risk along the whole chain – comes back and asks for one bank to be involved throughout that vertical chain to make sure that the first party – the pre-supplier – gets his 100 once he needs it, and the second one – the supplier – gets the second 100 with the first 100 and so forth. So he would end up with, first of all, less credit, less credit process cost and he also gets his funding just in time and just for the days it is needed. This is all based on the information flow which is available in the chain anyway.</p>
<p>I believe that credit process management within the supply chain is one of the areas where there is substantial cost savings potential for all participants and additional earnings potential for those banks who either employ a global network or work together with partners who can supply this. There are some banks, like Deutsche Bank, who try hard to market to particular industries which have vertical supply chains. We try to combine the information flow derived from the logistical data with our financing and payment structures at base in order to provide ‘just-in-time funding’.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“If you finance the whole chain, then you have a view on the total risk. When you get more information, your perceived risk moves very much closer to the real risk.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>van Beusekom (Fortis):</span> If you finance the whole chain, then you have a view on the total risk. When you get more information, your perceived risk moves very much closer to the real risk. In fact the real risk does not change, the transactional risk does not change, it’s just that you get better information about the real risk.</p>


<p><span>Amo Mena (Santander):</span> We should bear in mind that supply chain finance relies on the level of confidence and trust between a buyer and his suppliers. It is important that the buyer and suppliers have an existing business relationship developed over time. Banks take this into account when assessing risk and build up transaction data on real business flows, which improves our understanding of the risk profile and track record.</p>

</figure>
<p><span>Aldred (J.P. Morgan):</span> And it’s taking these solutions global. That works very well in the Spanish market, but does it work in other markets? I think that’s why you have to look at some of the industry verticals and ask, where does this lend itself to be applicable on a global basis?</p>
<p>We look at solutions that are in the US and ask how can we try and globalise them. They don’t always lend themselves to the European market for good reason.</p>


<p><span>Amo Mena (Santander):</span> Yes, a number of industries have developed vertically over a period of many years and have achieved deep integration between buyers and suppliers. The automotive sector is a good example. Here there have been major initiatives involving EDI and even e-invoicing, but subsequently they failed to integrate the financing piece. When you deliver supply chain finance into an integrated vertical industry your product has to be highly flexible, because your clients’ production line and how they interact with the suppliers may be very complex and automated, so it can be hard to add value unless you have considerable experience in this field.</p>
<p>We are working with some major car manufacturers in Latin America and Spain. These clients have recently extended the scope of their supply chain finance programmes, extending the reach of these products globally. These industries are now embarking on new developments in e-invoicing combined with supplier financing, as there are exciting synergies between these complementary products to optimise the cash conversion cycle.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> E-invoicing needs standards. Can we talk about formats and standards? Are there any standards emerging in this market? Because I understand if everyone banks with the one bank it’s easier, but that’s not reality, we all know that.</p>


<p><span>van Beusekom (Fortis):</span> There’s so many different systems around still and of course there are some directives and a lot of initiatives, but none that are really rolled out and implemented in the market.</p>


<p><span>Aldred (J.P. Morgan):</span> There are two challenges. One is the demand for consistent standards and the other is the demand for multi-banking delivery channels. The two are clearly related.</p>


<p><span>Collard (LTSB):</span> And consistency of working together and that’s where some of the collaboration is starting to happen. But it’s down to us to help our customers understand the value of adopting common standards, rather than just understanding ISO standards and going away to develop it.</p>
<p>If there is no collaboration between the bank and the corporate, the solution comes back looking very different to the ISO standard that‘s coming out of the counterparty you’re using in Asia, for example.</p>
<p>You know, we’re becoming translators as much as we’re becoming solution providers. So whether common standards are a reality today, given the fact that they might all be based on XML, it’s starting to become less important.</p>


<p><span>Hennah (SWIFT):</span> Perhaps we just need to be a bit careful with our use of language here. I wouldn’t strictly describe XML as a standard. It’s more of a framework that supports the exchange of structured data. The advantage lies in its flexibility. In e-invoicing, the absence of common standards fragments and slows the market. There is some evidence of convergence. SWIFT may have a role to play in future in supporting global harmonisation and interoperability.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“It’s down to us to help our customers understand the value of adopting common standards, rather than just understanding ISO standards and going away to develop it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> What about the future? Where do you see supply chain activity growing?</p>


<p><span>Amo Mena (Santander):</span> I would say the natural starting point is the domestic market within the EU. Terms of trade are open account, volumes are enormous, there is confidence between buyers and suppliers and there are lower regulatory or compliance issues to solve. So the pre-requisites for e-invoicing are present. I think it will grow relatively quickly in the next few years as bank solutions in this field are increasing and the different players in the supply chain are now realising they can achieve real benefits.</p>


<p><span>Hennah (SWIFT):</span> If we’re talking about geography, should we talk about the credit crunch perhaps? I can’t be the only person around the table who has a distaste for the term ‘credit crunch’ because it’s just become a kind of buzz word or catch phrase, as if the impact is the same the world over.</p>
<p>There was a time when, if the United States sneezed, we all caught a cold. I don’t think that’s the case any more. Whilst the United States may very well be headed for a deep and painful recession, and the eurozone perhaps not too far behind, there are other economies in the world, in developing markets like China and India, oil-based economies, countries that are big in commodities, where the economic outlook is very promising and demand is on the up. It is the opposite of the credit crunch. It’s about managing growth.</p>


<p><span>Aldred (J.P. Morgan):</span> I agree as long as we can help companies access those trade channels and overcome the challenges that these bring. Doing business in any country brings with it new regulatory requirements, different import/export controls, screening classification and a lot more. For these reasons alone, we are in a very good position to help our clients enter these markets and do so in an efficient manner.</p>
<p>AEO or the Approved Economic Operator scheme for example, comes into force in 2009 where, if a company does not have a process that is compliant and has been approved by their local custom regulator, their goods have a very good chance of being delayed at the border. As a result, this can have a detrimental financial impact.</p>
<p>So we’re also working with companies to ensure that their process is efficient and meets that standard to almost guarantee that they can move goods freely. That’s a different angle on the supply chain for a bank to offer but again it’s a natural extension.</p>


<p><span>Collard (LTSB):</span> In the current climate, the return of cash has never been more important than the return on cash because we’re now back to ‘cash is king’. The transaction market place will continue to develop and deep bank-client relationships will remain the cornerstone for the development of our supply chain solutions.</p>
<p> We’ll continue to focus on how our clients are actually managing their businesses and help them to create long term efficiencies. Nobody wants to pay high prices in the market place to borrow money, if you know you’ve got inefficiencies in your supply chain, where you can actually generate that working capital and make it happen for yourselves.</p>


<p><span>Ohse (Deutsche Bank):</span> One area we haven’t touched on so far are the channels, the collaborative platforms which would be necessary and are on offer by some banks.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> And then you worry about the interfaces with the other banks, is that the idea?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Multi bank supply chain finance is not an issue for corporates if they consider it appropriate.”</p>
</blockquote>

<figure class=""portrait left""><img alt=""Portrait of Axel-Peter Ohse"" height=""225"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2008/10/2008-10-tt-05-ttf-axel-peter-ohse-200x225.jpg"" width=""200""/>

<h6>Axel-Peter Ohse</h6>
</figcation>
</figure>
<p><span>Ohse (Deutsche Bank):</span>I would certainly look into that. The first thing is that the client chooses the platform and interfaces with it – there are various forms of interfacing available. Second, once the clients decide to take the Deutsche Bank portal, they provide the key data on purchase orders and/or invoice data. Third, there is a financing process.</p>
<p>There are a number of banks in Germany, usually smaller banks, which would not like to invest in developing such a platform, but which would like to join the financing opportunities.</p>
<p>So, basically, yes, I could open the portal and invite them to the financing part, if the client desires it. But let’s be clear, the portal is a relationship between the client and Deutsche Bank.</p>


<p><span>Aldred (J.P. Morgan):</span> The challenge today for banks is to bring this all together in one portal. We’ve achieved it in the cash management space, and clients now have much more visibility and control over their cash than they have ever had. It’s now time to take that to the next level around traditional trade, but what else can be done on the supply chain?</p>


<p><span>Amo Mena (Santander):</span> I don’t think one common portal or format is really necessary. We use a range of domestic channels as well as numerous international channels, like SWIFTNet, to communicate with many international companies for whom we need to be very flexible in meeting the connectivity challenge.</p>
<p>One way or another, we will integrate with a client’s ERP to obtain all the required data to contact the suppliers and complete their transactions. In Spain there are six or seven standards from different banks, the main players in the market, and we are all able to process everybody else’s standard through different channels. Multi bank supply chain finance is not an issue for corporates if they consider it appropriate.</p>


<figure class=""portrait right""><img alt=""Portrait of Jan Dirk van Beusekom"" height=""225"" src=""http://treasurytoday.com/i/2008/10/2008-10-tt-05-ttf-jan-dirk-van-beusekom-200x225.jpg"" width=""200""/>

<h6>Jan Dirk van Beusekom</h6>
</figcation>
</figure>
<p><span>van Beusekom (Fortis):</span> For instance bringing receivables management, payables management and mandate management for direct debits onto one platform. So there will be one portal, one channel to communicate regarding the total offering to all stakeholders.</p>


<p><span>Hennah (SWIFT):</span> SWIFT does have the potential to help the banks in these areas. We already have SWIFT SCORE which provides corporate access to multiple banks and we’re enhancing our traditional trade messages to support corporate to bank communications. So already, we’re starting to go down that road of helping corporates to communicate with multiple banks using a common standard via a single interface. But this is an evolutionary process and there is plenty of scope to build on that going forward.</p>
<p>But we have not yet debated the hottest topic of all, the TSU, the Trade Services Utility. Four of the five banks here are actually subscribed to the TSU. Perhaps I could just give a quick summary.</p>
<p>The TSU was made commercially available in April 2007 and now has more than 60 banks across 73 locations in 25 countries. We’ve also got five software vendors accredited to work with banks to integrate TSU functionality into their front office and back office systems. Plus, of course, banks such as J.P. Morgan who have similar applications that they are able to make available to other banks on a white label basis. So, this whole exercise in the first year, really, has been about building community and I feel that we’ve been extremely successful in terms of building that community.</p>
<p>Now the next step down the line, of course, is to generate volume and generate revenue. There is a huge amount of activity in terms of testing and training, but still not a huge amount of activity in terms of live traffic. It will take time for those volumes to evolve and to encourage growth, we will also introduce new features with Release 2. </p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> What will this do?</p>


<p><span>Hennah (SWIFT):</span> Release 2 will support a model which involves more than two banks to a transaction, so it introduces the concept of syndication whereas today it’s just a two bank model: buyer bank, seller bank.</p>
<p>We will also support additional data sets. At the moment we have purchase order, commercial invoice and transport. In the next Release we will also support insurance and certificates. There is also going to be a reference in the payment message that will enable automatic reconciliation between the TSU transaction and the settlement instruction. And there will be two additional messages. One is called the NIP, which is a Notice of Intent to Pay. This is actually a corporate message, so it’s the corporate’s Notice of Intent to Pay, conveyed from one bank to the other. But it’s not a legal obligation. The second one is a Bank Payment Obligation, which is a true obligation on the part of the bank to pay. That will strengthen the value proposition, particularly from the exporter bank perspective, and I believe encourage wider usage in a live environment. So that is where we are today.</p>


<p><span>Amo Mena (Santander):</span> I really think that TSU arrived on the scene quite early for many banks but its day will come and I do believe it’s the right way to go.</p>


<p><span>van Beusekom (Fortis):</span> Aren’t you adding an extra level with the NIP, the Notice of Intent to Pay? That’s exactly one of the modules we have been looking for for some time.</p>


<p><span>Aldred (J.P. Morgan):</span> It’s not irrevocable.</p>


<p><span>Hennah (SWIFT):</span> It’s not a legal obligation but it does provide an additional level of comfort.</p>


<p><span>Collard (LTSB):</span> But the more credibility the corporate builds up from the fact they have paid in the past will mean others will want to do business with them in the belief they’re going to get paid, which is the eBay model.</p>


<p><span>Hennah (SWIFT):</span> I truly believe the TSU has the potential to be anything that we want it to be, and it’s up to all of us to mould it in the right direction.</p>


<p><span>Parkinson (TT):</span> Thank you everyone.</p>
