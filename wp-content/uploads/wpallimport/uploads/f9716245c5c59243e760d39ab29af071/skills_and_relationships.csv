Tapping into the power of empathy,"


<p><em>Empathy is often misunderstood as being a sign of weakness, or being too ‘soft’ when, in fact, it actually comes from a place of strength. Leaders who learn to apply the power of empathy are more likely to be more fulfilled and successful in their roles.</em></p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Think of a job that needs doing at work. How long will it take to complete? Will it be done at lightning speed, or at a snail’s pace? If you are a leader, and are relying on others to do the work, the difference between it being done quickly or slowly could hinge on the power of empathy.</p>
<p>“Empathy is the key leadership skill enabling us to really understand why people do what they do, to see the world from their perspectives and build the trusted relationships that empower people to be at their best,” says Daniel Murray, Founder and Director of Empathic Consulting.</p>
<p>He cites the example of Gordon Bethune, the CEO of Continental Airlines between 1994 and 2004 who was credited with rescuing the company from the brink of failure and dramatically improving morale among employees. Bethune reportedly said his experience as a plane mechanic helped him because he knew how long it took to fix a plane if he wanted to fix it. He also knew how long it took if he didn’t want to fix it. “The intangible factors of values, relationships and culture have a huge influence over whether we really want to fix the plane or not,” explains Murray.</p>
<p>Empathy is a key skill for leaders to understand this gap, and Murray argues it is not a nice-to-have. In fact, with leaders working across many countries – with people of increasingly diverse backgrounds – empathy is critical to long-term, sustainable performance. “Empathy is the key leadership skill to navigate this intangible world,” says Murray.</p>
<p>And it’s not just a key skill for leading, it’s also a way to form meaningful connections with others, says Tracy Brower, author of Secrets to Happiness at Work. “These connections can make us happier and more fulfilled in our careers because we’ll have stronger relationships with co-workers and feel a greater sense of social fulfilment,” Brower says. Also, she adds, empathy is important for success in our careers because it helps us solve problems and innovate. With design thinking – a process of designing solutions that are based around customer problems – a key ingredient is being able to empathise with the end user. “When we understand where the customer is coming from—including the internal customer of our work — we can respond most effectively to meet their needs. This will help us grow in our careers because we’ll be more effective and develop credibility for our responsiveness,” says Brower.</p>
<p>There are numerous other benefits – for companies and individuals – for those who harness the power of empathy. Niina Majaniemi, a keynote speaker and author, tells Treasury Today that empathy “helps grow revenue, build customer satisfaction, build employee happiness, strengthen brand, increase collaboration, survive from crisis, increase innovation and grow trust.”</p>
<p>As an empathy expert, Majaniemi is keen to point out what empathy is and isn’t, and is keen to bust the myths around it. The most common myths, she says, are that empathy is only about being nice, or that empathy is a sign of weakness. “These myths can’t be further from the truth,” she says.</p>
<p>This echoes a quote from New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern that has been doing the rounds on social media: “One of the criticisms I’ve faced over the years is that I’m not aggressive enough or assertive enough, or maybe somehow, because I’m empathetic, it means I’m weak. I totally rebel against that. I refuse to believe that you cannot be compassionate and strong,” she is quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Majaniemi elaborates on what empathy actually is: “Empathy is about creating a work culture with respect and understanding. It does not mean that we need to let others walk all over us or change our decisions based on what others want. It means that we are assertive, driven, and fulfil our goals, and that we are accountable and demand others to do the same. We do it in a way where we incorporate empathy into strategy and all decisions that we make,” says Majaniemi. This, in turn, translates into optimal results for a company in the long-term and ultimately helps them grow their revenue.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>

<p>Majaniemi argues that it is often fear that is holding leaders back. She gives an example, from her experience as an empathy expert, where a leader had a team that was really unhappy. Despite this, the leader was afraid to hear feedback about why morale was so low – he didn’t want to be badmouthed by them. “Empathy takes courage. This person was not brave enough to include empathy in their leadership strategy, but instead acted in a way that weak leaders do,” says Majaniemi. This leadership style often results in uncommitted employees, reduced efficiency and productivity. “This shows why authoritarian leadership simply doesn’t work anymore in today’s business world,” says Majaniemi.</p>
<p>Murray agrees that empathy is not about being soft or weak. He says that trust is the goal, and this is different from affection. “As a leader, I need to trust people and they must trust me, but I don’t have to like them. This is not to say that you can’t have both. I don’t need to like my dentist before she puts a drill in my mouth, but I sure need to trust her. And as much as I like my friend Neil, I would never trust him to do a root canal. Teams need trust and this is what empathic leaders foster,” he explains.</p>
<p>Empathy isn’t something that people either have or they don’t have; it is something that can be developed. Murray says, “Remember, empathy is a practice. You need to work on it.” And there are a number of ways to practise, and develop, empathy. Majaniemi says that listening and asking questions is important. When people gossip about others, she points out, they often say things like ‘What were they thinking?!’ or ‘I can’t understand why they would do that’. “We do not really mean that we can’t understand. We mean we don’t want to understand. Ask, and you might be surprised. Pause and reflect before talking,” she says.</p>
<p>And listening is also a key skill. Brower advises to “turn down your inner monologue and really listen to what the other person is saying. Actively consider what they must be thinking — cognitive empathy – or what they must be feeling – emotional empathy,” she says. It is also important to respond appropriately. Brower says that, based on what you hear, you should be ready to respond when necessary. “Offer encouragement if they’re going through something challenging, or share in their celebration based on their good news. Offer your help if they’re struggling with a project. Or simply keep things rolling if you’re in the middle of a collaboration and both feeling good about your progress. Your response doesn’t need to be complex or time-consuming, but meeting them where they are can have big payoffs,” Brower explains.</p>
<p>When you do listen to what people have to say, it is important to let go of your unconscious biases and judgement, says Manajiemi. She gives the example that with Zoom or Teams meetings there maybe pressure to put the camera on. And while a refusal to do so may be perceived to be down to laziness – because it is assumed they are still in their pyjamas – there may be all manner of reasons why people do not like to do so. One could be disability, for example. “We can’t judge and assume, we need to drive to understand. We need to give the benefit of the doubt until we know better, and this way we build more productive and profitable work,” Manajiemi says.</p>
<p>Murray also advises about leaving biases at the door, and how it is important to challenge your own views. “We build a set of mental models that explain how the world works. Analytically-minded people are experts in understanding the rules, systems and laws that govern mathematics and finance, many are objective and indisputable. Unfortunately, our brains are not as good as distinguishing between these objective facts and our more subjective beliefs,” Murray says. For example, someone yelling at home maybe interpreted differently – either as something bad happening, or people merely expressing themselves passionately. “Yelling means nothing until it is interpreted, and that interpretation is not a fact. Many times, when we work with others, we will judge their comments, opinions, actions and behaviours by our mental models. To be more empathetic, we need to challenge our initial assumptions and try to understand their mental models to really understand why they do what they do,” says Murray.</p>
<p>In order to take these tips on board, it is also necessary to manage yourself and how you handle stress. Majaniemi comments that stress is a common element that prevents us from being empathic. “When we are busy, we become a slave to our impulses,” she says. Most people can probably think of a time when they’ve thought, or said, ‘I don’t have time to listen to this – I’ve got my own problems’, she points out.</p>
<p>And similar to destressing and not being too busy, one of Brower’s top tips for building empathy is to be present with others. “Rather than multi-tasking – as we can all tend to do – really tune in and focus on others and what they are expressing,” she says.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, Murray advises to clear the desk – or desktop. “One of the biggest inhibitors of quality conversations are distractions. We have inboxes dinging, phones binging, post-it notes hanging off our screens and social media buzzing in our pockets. While you might think these don’t cause a distraction, research has shown that even the slightest noise in our environment can impact our ability to really focus and listen to other people,” says Murray. “If you are meeting with someone and want to really listen, clear your desk. Turn off your phone, put it in a draw. Sleep your computer or if you are on a virtual meeting, turn off notifications and close all programmes you don’t need. Really focus all your attention on the other person.”</p>
<p>Murray is also a believer in the power of silence, especially in a fast-paced work environment where schedules are busy, and meetings filled with question and answer sessions that can feel like a prosecutor’s grilling.</p>
<p>“Silence is often one of the most powerful tools in building a deeper understanding. When you are speaking with someone, instead of asking questions to validate your current thoughts, ask open questions and leave space after the person answers. What you will find is that people often give a shallow initial answer to a question, but with a bit of silence, they often offer a much richer and more thoughtful answer if there is space,” says Murray. “This is where the gold can be in understanding. Empathy can be as simple as having the curiosity and patience to wait,” he adds.</p>

<p>The Treasury Recruitment Company recently conducted a study and used the data to compile “<a href=""https://treasuryrecruitment.com/the-critical-skills-you-need-for-future-success/"" target=""_blank"">The Treasury Skills Wheel</a>”, a selection of skills that every treasury professional should master. Soft skills such as communication and relationship building feature heavily. Indeed, soft skills are increasingly being recognised as important in the workplace – especially as treasury has become much more integrated with core teams and functions of the business.</p>
<p>Laura White, Operations Director, The Treasury Recruitment Company, says: “As treasury has become more valued and recognised across businesses from an operational perspective, we have noticed a significant shift in the importance hiring managers are placing on certain soft skills when making hiring decisions. These are no longer viewed as ‘a nice to have’ but an essential requirement, often ranking at the very top of the ‘must have’ list of skills.”</p>
<p>White adds that effective communication and relationship-building skills are of particular importance, “as it is no longer just about treasurers talking to other treasurers or finance partners, but often about being able to articulate complex situations and problems to non-finance people, many of whom do not even have a base level understanding of the subject.”</p>
<p>A key skill that underpins all communication is the art of listening, but in practice this means something different to everyone. To some, it may simply mean the basic process of hearing what someone else is saying. To others – and many experts agree – hearing and listening are two separate things. It’s also important to understand the different types of listening that people can do.</p>
<p>Whatever your belief about it, listening is one of the most important skills any person – professional or not – can have, and yet research from ‘Business Communication: Strategies and Skills’ by R. C. Husman, J. M. Lahiff and J. M. Penrose (1988), has shown that the average person’s listening is at only 25% efficiency.</p>
<h4 id=""listening-matters"">Listening matters</h4>
<p><a href=""https://www.juliantreasure.com/"" target=""_blank"">Julian Treasure</a>, a sound and communication expert and founder of The Sound Agency, and <a href=""http://www.mullenders.org/"" target=""_blank"">Richard Mullender</a>, an ex-Metropolitan police hostage negotiator, both rank listening at the top of the list of necessary traits for both managers and staff.</p>
<p>Mullender states that listening is the most important aspect of communication. “You’ll never understand someone by talking to them – you’ll only ever understand them by listening to them,” he says.</p>
<p>“It’s important to understand that listening and speaking are related to each other – it’s a circular relationship,” says Treasure. “It’s impossible to inspire people if you don’t understand them, and listening is always the doorway to understanding.” Treasure defines the four styles of leadership as “tell, sell, consult, join,” and notes that three out of the four require listening skills.</p>
<h4 id=""leaders-who-listen"">Leaders who listen</h4>
<p>Key to any manager’s position, treasury or not, is the ability to influence and lead their team. “Listen, understand, influence,” says Mullender. “If you listen to a person, you can understand them. If you understand them, you can influence them.”</p>
<p>Sonia Clifton-Bligh, Director, Regional Treasury Services Centre Asia Pacific, Johnson &amp; Johnson, notes that when an individual first steps into a leadership position there is a “tendency to believe you have to speak with confidence and authority, and be armed with all the answers.” As she has progressed in her career, however, she is “now more concerned with communicating to inspire, engage, encourage dialogue and idea generation.”</p>
<p>She believes that a leader’s objective should be to ensure that the team feels empowered, trusted, and respected, and that providing an open and inclusive communication style is integral to this.</p>
<p>“Listening is the primary warning sense for a reason,” comments Treasure, highlighting the importance of listening for threats, opportunities and ideas, as well as the role listening plays in the learning process. “It’s probably the most important skill to develop in order to be a good leader or a good worker – and yet we don’t teach or prioritise it, so most individuals and almost all organisations are very poor listeners,” he adds, citing The Organisational Listening Project’s findings that organisations that are better at listening have better work environments and results.</p>


<h2 class=""h3 copy__heading"">Non-verbal communication</h2>
<p>In the 1970s, Professor Albert Mehrabian of the University of California studied the relevance of verbal and non-verbal messages during communication. He found that if a speaker’s words and body language – in other words, their verbal and non-verbal messages – differed, the listener was more likely to believe the nonverbal communication than the verbal.</p>
<p>Professor Mehrabian then split communication into three distinct sections: words, tone of voice, and body language. He concluded that words account for only 7% of communication, tone of voice for 38%, and body language for 55%. Although the accuracy of Mehrabian’s quantification of communication is disputed – and both Treasure and Mullender disagree with it entirely – it does work to highlight the importance of nonverbal cues when communicating, and not just when listening.</p>
<p>Clifton-Bligh appreciates the importance of non-verbal communication as well, noting that “non-verbal communication, such as body language, gestures, pitch or tone of voice, can communicate unintended messages.” Ensuring your body language matches your message is essential to ensure that you create “an environment where people feel their voice is heard and that they won’t be judged for their contribution,” she states.</p>

<p>Mehrabian himself admits that his theory is limited in its applications and only applicable in certain contexts, and this has become more evident with the increasing use of technology as online messaging, emails and texts have become more widely used forms of communication.</p>
<p>Whilst his theory may be contested in 2019, it does suggest that if a person wants to be heard, they need to ensure that they match their words with suitable and effective tone of voice and body language.</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<h4 id=""improving-your-skills"">Improving your skills</h4>
<p>Treasure shares two of his top tips from his book, ‘How to be Heard’. The first, he says, is to give yourself a few minutes of silence each day. “Silence recalibrates the ears, resets your listening, and allows you to listen afresh,” he comments, noting that this is especially important in a world where people are surrounded by constant noise. “We can go very numb and cease to be able to listen effectively,” he says.</p>
<p>The second tip relates to the concept of “listening positions”. Treasure suggests that we all listen through filters. “Your filters include the culture you were born into, the language you speak, your values, attitudes, beliefs, emotions, expectations and intentions,” he states. Treasure believes that our individual listening changes throughout the day and that listening is unique for each person. If you can become conscious of those filters, you can change the way you listen.</p>
<p>Clifton-Bligh emphasises the importance of applying these filters when communicating with teams, believing that “it’s important to not assume that your style is understood.” She makes an active effort to ensure she doesn’t use expressions or colloquialisms that could cause confusion or be misinterpreted, and has found that this is especially important when speaking with groups from diverse backgrounds.</p>
<p>One of Mullender’s top tips for improving listening skills is to “give yourself an outcome and know what you’re listening for.” He suggests that when listening to someone, individuals need to pay attention to certain things: facts, emotions and motivators, to name a few. “The key to it all is understanding the person you’re talking to,” he says.</p>
<h4 id=""active-listening"">Active listening</h4>
<p>Mullender also mentions active listening skills, noting that they aren’t quite what they seem. Active listening skills include verbal and non-verbal things that a listener can do whilst someone is talking to demonstrate attentive listening. However, as Mullender points out, “nodding your head doesn’t help you listen. Saying ‘okay’ or ‘carry on’ only keeps the person talking – it doesn’t mean you’re listening and understand what they’re saying.” And understanding is, of course, a key outcome of listening.</p>
<p>For Clifton-Bligh, active listening also includes noticing when things might need rephrasing to clarify ambiguous points, and to check for understanding. By paying attention to how someone is receiving your communications, and adapting accordingly, a “productive exchange of information” is encouraged.</p>
<h4 id=""types-of-listening"">Types of listening</h4>
<p>Treasure identifies three types of listening: outer, inner, and created.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>He defines outer listening as “making meaning from sound” – a process that involves selecting what sound to pay attention to, and then interpreting it. This is a mental process that Treasure says differs from simply hearing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inner listening, he explains, means understanding that the voice inside your head is not you; rather you are the one listening to it. Treasure says that learning it is possible to ignore this voice is a very powerful skill – especially for those with quite a negative inner voice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treasure defines created listening as something that arises from the speaker’s actions and reputation, as well as from the listener’s own unique listening filters. “It changes over time and from person to person, or audience to audience,” says Treasure, “so it is a grave but very common mistake to assume that everyone listens like you do.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=""bad-listening"">Bad listening</h4>
<p>In Mullender’s previous career as a police hostage negotiator, he had to learn not only how to be a good listener, but also what makes a bad listener. Generally, what’s the worst thing someone could do when listening to someone else?</p>
<p>“Not knowing what you’re listening for,” says Mullender. “If you don’t walk into a meeting knowing exactly what you want to get out of it, you won’t get anything.”</p>
<p>Clifton-Bligh emphasises the need to “communicate clearly and succinctly” in all situations – a skill that can be important in a range of scenarios, such as meeting and negotiating with banks, service providers and suppliers.</p>


<blockquote><p>People that shout over others don’t tend to listen very much – and eventually they don’t get listened to either because people get fed up with not having attention paid to them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">Richard Mullender, Listening and Communication Expert, Mullender’s</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Similarly, when trying to understand how another person feels, it’s important to accept the limitations to how fully this can be achieved. It’s arrogance, says Mullender, to assume you know how someone feels, even if you have had a similar experience. You can only ever understand how someone feels, not truly know for yourself – and the only way you can understand is by listening to what the other person in saying.</p>
<p>In a workplace setting, this application is particularly useful when speaking with a staff member who is upset or angry. Being a leader means navigating both the ups and downs of your team – and learning how to handle all situations is crucial to effective communication and overall team happiness.</p>
<h4 id=""listening-better"">Listening better</h4>
<p>Treasure notes that his TED talk, ‘How to speak so that people want to listen’, has been viewed five times more than his talk on listening, ‘Five ways to listen better’. This emphasises the extent to which most people prioritise being heard over hearing others.</p>
<p>His advice for anyone struggling to be heard? “Listen better.” He says that being sensitive to how others like to receive communications will ensure you become much better at communicating effectively. “Often the problem with struggling to be heard is choosing the wrong time, or saying the wrong thing,” he comments.</p>
<p>According to Treasure, a key question that speakers should ask themselves in order to be good communicators is “what’s the listening I’m speaking into?” He states, “Just by asking that question, you automatically become sensitive to it.”</p>
<p>Mullender’s advice to someone struggling to be heard is just as simple: “Make sure what you’re saying is important to the person that’s listening to you.” In other words, it’s important to make sure that the people listening are actually interested in hearing what you have to say. Even the most charismatic speaker in the world may struggle to hold an audience’s attention unless the audience has something to gain from listening to what is said.</p>
<p>Mullender agrees with Treasure’s statement that in order to be listened to you need to be a good listener yourself. “People who listen well tend to be listened to,” Mullender points out. “People that shout over others don’t tend to listen very much – and eventually they don’t get listened to either because people get fed up with not having attention paid to them.”</p>
<h4 id=""two-way-street"">Two-way street</h4>
<p>So where does that leave treasury professionals? In order to lead a team effectively, treasurers need to both listen and be listened to. Similarly, team members need to be able to listen to instructions – but also speak out when the need arises.</p>
<p>Clifton-Bligh strongly believes that “communicating contributes to transparency and encourages trust.” She adds, “Trust is conducive to creativity, and seeing an idea come to life brings satisfaction.” After all, communication is a two-way street and both parties need to be open to hearing one another.</p>
<p>As Treasure points out, as a society, every day we are almost overloaded with noise. It’s natural that people try to tune out the noises that may seem to be of very little worth – but it’s also essential to avoid accidentally cutting out too much, lest we miss the important things.</p>

<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>When financial and economic challenges seem insurmountable, the role of the treasurer comes to the fore. But to enable the treasurer to remain calm and collected a network of support is required. The work of Ireland’s professional treasury body, IACT, helps provide this support, bringing together peers from across the sectors, raising awareness of the big issues and exploring solutions.</p>
<p>Two of the biggest externally-driven issues of the day for IACT’s membership (and for many more besides) are the impact of Brexit, and the replacement of LIBOR. With the precise nature of their impact yet to unfold, strong elements of the unknown prevail, notes Dympna Donnelly, VP Treasury at SAP, and current President of IACT.</p>
<p>Brexit is likely to cause issues around disruption to the supply chain and the financing thereof. “Ongoing uncertainty means that Brexit planning is somewhat vague and limited in scope; there are still so many unanswered questions,” says Donnelly. “But regardless of how Brexit unfolds over the next 12 months, treasurers must remain engaged.”</p>
<p>The shift from LIBOR and EONIA to SONIA and €STR has a more direct treasury impact. Uncertainty still abounds here, the outcome of the ECB’s paper on €STR, due in October, hopefully quelling this for businesses using LIBOR-indexed floating rates.</p>
<p>Before the switch in 2021, treasurers must review, possibly amend, and certainly secure agreement on all associated internal documentation and external contracts with banks and other third parties. Many questions remain unanswered but, notes Donnelly, the sheer volume of work involved in probing legal documentation, talking to banks and understanding LIBOR’s replacement, should not be underestimated.</p>
<h4 id=""helping-hands"">Helping hands</h4>
<p>Brexit remains a series of unknowns whereas LIBOR has a more defined process around it, albeit one that places a heavy demand on treasury resources. However, these events are just part of a wider series of treasury concerns over the coming months and years.</p>
<p>IACT plays an important supporting role for members. It runs regular breakfast briefings and roundtables on all the hot topics, calling upon independent experts to deliver a treasury slant to the ensuing discussions.</p>
<p>IACT also organises an annual conference in Dublin (this year held on 20th November), curating an impressive international speaker list, this year featuring Holger Neuhaus, ECB’s Head of Division, Money Market &amp; Liquidity, on interest rate benchmark reform.</p>
<p>The 2019 event, notes Donnelly, is “very timely”, following (all being well) both the publication of the ECB’s guidance documentation on LIBOR, and Brexit conclusion. Treasurers may at last be able discuss and respond to these events with some certainty.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the outcomes here, the ongoing facilitation of highly interactive networking opportunities are a key part of IACT’s remit as a professional body. On a personal level, Donnelly, having progressed from accountancy into treasury, knows first-hand of the benefits of meeting peers, face-to-face.</p>
<p>“There was a huge learning curve for me moving into treasury. I found the IACT, and the whole networking experience, an excellent way to learn about the hot topics and how to deal with them,” she comments. “I would encourage all treasurers to get involved with the IACT to keep themselves fully informed in a constantly and rapidly changing economic, technical and regulatory environment.”</p>
<p>As a means of talking to, learning from, and sharing with other treasurers, IACT is a vital source of information on everything from day-to-day matters to extraordinary macroeconomic events such as Brexit. Acting as a conduit for expertise from diverse sources, such as banking, legal, taxation, accounting, and technology, it channels relevant information to keep treasurers up to speed.</p>
<p>The benefits extend far and wide. Indeed, by liaising with national agencies such as IDA (which is targeted with boosting inward foreign direct investment into Ireland), Donnelly says IACT is well-positioned to knowledge-share with the world’s corporate community, an added attraction for corporates considering investing into Ireland.</p>
<p>Combined with Ireland’s pro-business stance, it’s easy to see why the number of specialist treasury operations in Ireland is increasing. With IACT enabling treasurers to leverage the country’s professional network, it is fostering an improved understanding of the key domestic and macro issues.</p>
<p>With the help of IACT, treasurers with the right connections are helping to create a greater level of expertise amongst the community, and an increased awareness of the importance of the role at the wider organisational level. In the current environment of uncertainty, every business stands to benefit.</p>

<p><em>The way in which we communicate with others speaks volumes about our professionalism and our ability to work with others. For many treasurers, the extension of the role into the wider business – and the inclusion as a strategic partner – means sharper communication skills are essential.</em></p>
<p>Good communication is just common sense isn’t it? Certainly, there are those amongst us who are natural communicators, apparently for whom no social situation is awkward, and no message ever misconstrued.</p>
<p>But admit it: most of us have at some time sent an email without checking its content then felt the sudden panic as we realise that we really should not have sent it. With the prevalence of social media tools such as Twitter and WhatsApp, the immediacy of messaging means it is even easier to make communication errors. These can sometimes come back and bite years after the fact.</p>
<p>Despite the view that ‘natural’ communicators walk amongst us, our communication skills are not always as sharp as we like to think they are. Everyone can benefit from a spot of revision from time to time.</p>
<h3 id=""staying-professional"">Staying professional</h3>
<p>There is a big difference between being talked at and being engaged in a conversation. For all forms of communication, and through all channels, this is true. Communication, by definition, is a two-way process, with every message requiring a sender and receiver. Being a skilled communicator is not natural; it comes with practice.</p>
<p>Some people are more adept (or rather, more practiced) than others but in business and everyday life communication is a necessary skill. It helps build trust and respect, and it forges deeper connections between people which, ultimately, gets things done.</p>
<p>In a commercial context, the idea that communication is easy if the recipients know who you are and why you are doing things, has some mileage. But failure to consider the nuances of effective communication runs the risk of alienating the intended audience.</p>
<p>Former AOL CEO Tim Armstrong (he is now CEO of a part of AOL parent, Verizon) made an unpopular decision worse back in 2013 when he tried to defuse staff tension around possible job losses. During a conference call with the 1,000 or so affected employees, he aimed to boost morale and move the conversation on. Instead, he fired the company’s creative director, Abel Lenz, in front of those employees for a perceived wrong-doing (he was recording the event). The public nature of the termination was described by an observer as “shameful and disgusting” behaviour.</p>
<p>Regardless of Lenz’s transgression, Armstrong turned what should have been a reassuring message into one of abject negativity and, in so doing, caused tremendous harm to his own credibility as a professional communicator.</p>
<p>This debacle demonstrates that although what Armstrong did was, in his own words, unfair to the former employee at a “human level”, even some senior executives can occasionally be prone to responding in an all too human way, lashing out in frustration. This is something that great communicators know not to do.</p>
<p>Everyone gets angry from time to time but reacting without taking time to form a rational response can prove disastrous. This is especially concerning where electronic channels enable unintentionally bad messages to ‘go viral’, helping to form the opinion that the individual lacks self-control and emotional intelligence and are not to be trusted. Respect goes out the window.</p>
<h3 id=""improving-communication"">Improving communication</h3>
<p>We’ve all had the experience of getting it wrong, so how can communication be improved? According to web resources such as Mindtools, Entrepreneur Europe and Lifehacker, there are several quite simple steps we can all take to improve our chances of getting our message across in a positive way.</p>
<h3 id=""assertiveness-not-aggression"">Assertiveness not aggression</h3>
<p>Being assertive means being able to stand up for your own or other people’s views, needs or rights, but doing so in a calm and positive way. Assertiveness means having the confidence to say ‘no’ when necessary, yet still helping to maintain relationships on an even keel. In essence, it takes you closer to what you want to achieve whilst considering the views of others.</p>


<blockquote>I think more than ever it is imperative to have strong professional relationships in order to stay abreast of developments. Every treasurer should be able to demonstrate strong communication skills as the role becomes more connected with the business.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">Helen Hanby, Director, International Treasury, Biogen</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>In the same way that confidence quickly becomes arrogance if left unchecked, over-assertiveness can morph into aggression. Aggression is all about getting your own way, regardless of other people’s views or even rights. It might get immediate results but at what cost?</p>
<p>Assertiveness, as with all communication skills, comes with practice. Begin by confronting mildly tense situations where you perceive the threat as minimal yet worth tackling. Learn to set reasonable limits and how to say ‘no’. Respect yourself and let go of the guilt of saying no. Practice getting to the point and clearly articulating the real issue; don’t confuse people with the minutiae, or by taking a convoluted route to your point.</p>
<h3 id=""tackling-difficult-conversations-head-on"">Tackling difficult conversations head-on</h3>
<p>Avoiding an issue can allow it to take on a life of its own. Gossip and speculation are often rife in offices; the longer a problem is left, the more out of control it can become.</p>
<p>When communicating a difficult issue, such as when dealing with a problematic member of staff, using a tool such as the Situation – Behaviour – Impact (SBI) model can help focus the conversation and give it a positive direction.</p>
<p>Preparation is vital, but it helps the subject understand the context of the situation, it describes the specific observable behaviours being addressed, and it highlights the impact of the subject’s behaviour on you or others without making assumptions. Rather than creating conflict, SBI offers the subject a clear and neutral view of the problem, giving them the opportunity to respond positively.</p>
<h3 id=""keyboard-warrior"">Keyboard warrior</h3>
<p>Sacking someone in front of their peers has damaging consequences for all, as AOL’s Tim Armstrong, referred to previously, discovered when his PR team hurriedly urged him to issue an apology to all employees.</p>
<p>The opposite of the Armstrong approach is hiding behind an email to deliver bad news. In 2017, the UK’s Equality and Human Rights Commission were reported as having sacked several striking staff by email, giving them one day to clear their desks. In another case, back in 2014, Michael Laudrup was dismissed as manager from Premier League football club, Swansea, claiming he was sacked by email. In both cases, the action was subsequently denied by the accused but by then the damage was done.</p>
<p>These kinds of story make a big media splash because people recognise the inappropriateness of delivering bad news from a distance. Whether the old maxim that ‘the truth should never get in the way of a good story’ is one that applies or not, such events suggest weakness of management and cause employee outrage.</p>
<p>The fact is that written communication channels can fail to soften the blow of difficult messages because they cannot carry non-verbal cues, such as body language or tone of voice, that in-person communication offers. Furthermore, there is no opportunity for the message sender to deal immediately with any misunderstanding arising from that communication. The solution is easy: bad news should be delivered sensitively and in person.</p>
<h3 id=""preparation-preparation-preparation"">Preparation, preparation, preparation</h3>
<p>Any communication that is intended to have an impact should be subject to proper planning and preparation. Slide presentations, for example, need to suit the context. It sounds obvious but loading complex graphs and long strings of text may not suit an audience in a large hall where the back rows can’t see them.</p>
<p>Similarly, offering interminably long talks to a post-lunch conference audience rarely gets the message across. Yet it happens. Be mindful too that because emails don’t carry contextualising non-verbal cues, it is very easy for the message to be misconstrued.</p>


<blockquote>Well-developed soft skills are essential to keep staff motivated and happy. As CFO, I rely heavily on them. I want them to feel responsible and be part of the business because if it grows and does well, we all grow and do well! The ability to read people and make good judgements does not come from sitting behind a desk. It comes from travelling and meeting people.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">Dheeraj ‘Raj’ Chadha, CFO, TeleAdapt</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>When speaking publicly, rehearsal can bring more fluency to the nervous (and alert the speaker to expressions they may stumble on). Being terrified may require more work to overcome. For written work, always sense-check the appropriateness of content before sending, especially an email.</p>
<p>Communicators should plan what they are going to say and how they are going to say it. We can’t all be great orators or writers, but we can all take the time to prepare a credible, intelligent, and hopefully compelling message. As part of the preparation, it helps to understand and respond to the audience’s likely emotional response as well as their intellectual take on your message.</p>
<h3 id=""the-power-of-proofing"">The power of proofing</h3>
<p>Where treasurers increasingly have contact with other functions and external partners, creating the right impression through the written word is important. It may be the first contact and, as the saying goes, first impressions last.</p>
<p>Grammatical errors and poor spelling are signs of carelessness for many people. Proof-read everything but don’t rely on a spell-checker to bail you out; it may correct the word but is the word correct?</p>
<p>For important documents use a second pair of eyes prior to sending. If you have the time, once you have finished your work, walk away from it for a while. Re-reading it later can reveal some fundamental errors.</p>
<h3 id=""everyone-is-different"">Everyone is different</h3>
<p>Trying to deliver your message across multiple platforms and audiences without tailoring it to the different needs and expectations of your audience is risky. As a treasurer, you can use complex expressions and ideas related to the profession and safely assume that your audience will understand. Try using the same technical language with the board, CEO, or your procurement team, and you will spend much of your time explaining yourself. Or simply fail to communicate.</p>
<p>Jargon and the overuse of acronyms is a sure-fire way to lose the interest of a non-partisan audience. Explaining everything to a knowledgeable audience is patronising and a waste of their time.</p>
<p>Bear in mind too that in a globalised business, cross-border trade can mean cross-cultural communication. Don’t make assumptions; learn about your audience. An understanding of the people with whom you wish to communicate may suggest a rethink of your message, tone and approach, timing and even expectations, to avoid mis-communication.</p>
<h3 id=""learn-to-listen"">Learn to listen</h3>
<p>Listening is a vital part of communication. The definition of listening offered by Richard Mullender, a former hostage negotiator, is the “identification, selection and interpretation of key words that turn information into intelligence”.</p>
<p>The key to successful listening is to listen for the speaker’s motivators, values and beliefs. Conversations should be used to learn from others, not as a platform to demonstrate your own intellect.</p>
<p>Sound specialist Julian Treasure advises people to adjust their listening ‘position’ according to need. Practice by listening to a speech, trying to focus on a different angle such as from a critical or empathetic perspective and comparing outcomes.</p>
<p>Treasury offers the acronym ‘RASA’ as a guide to better listening: Receive by making eye contact with and focusing on the other person; Appreciate by giving indications of acknowledgment through cues like head nods or short vocal replies; Summarise by getting the other person to clarify the point of anything that doesn’t register; and Ask by posing follow-up questions on whatever you just learned.</p>
<h3 id=""read-it-right"">Read it right</h3>
<p>Correct interpretation of body language is vital if subtle clues are to be incorporated into the overall communication experience. The web resource, Learning Mind suggests successful communication requires the constant observation of the gestures, facial expressions and postures of the recipient to build a fuller picture.</p>
<p>Placing the entire communication – verbal and non-verbal – in context is vital if real meaning is to be derived. Although folded arms and crossed legs can convey a closed mind within the recipient, there may be a practical reason for this stance: they may simply be cold.</p>
<p>Individuals often display idiosyncratic positive and negative non-verbal signals too, such as a certain movement when in a certain situation (tugging an earlobe when nervous, for example). Distinguishing these from everyday movements can help understand their mood in future encounters. Some people are well-versed in body-language and could be deceiving you but observable contradictions may exist.</p>
<p>Although body language is not an exact science, humans will either display a state of comfort (satisfaction, happiness, relaxation) or discomfort (displeasure, stress, anxiety). The difference may not be obvious, or the individual may be trying to cover up their feelings. By correctly interpreting their state of mind, in context, it becomes easier to tailor the communication to match.</p>
<h3 id=""dont-go-viral"">Don’t go viral</h3>
<p>Given the complex nature of communication, it is hardly surprising that mistakes are made. But with a little understanding of what is involved in getting a message across successfully, the chances of accidentally ‘going viral’ at your expense are minimised.</p>
<p>More importantly, understanding and applying the different elements of positive communication helps to ensure professionalism and respect are maintained and, ultimately, things get done.</p>

<p><em>Treasurers are increasingly getting involved in areas which fall outside the traditional parameters of treasury. What does this mean in practice – and how can this benefit both treasury professionals and their organisations? Five treasury professionals share their experiences of stepping outside the comfort zone.</em></p>
<p> It’s no secret that treasury has undergone considerable changes in recent years. The days of treasurers operating from their ivory towers are long gone. Since the financial crisis, the treasurer’s role has gained greater visibility across the organisation. At the same time, treasurers are increasingly exposed to new challenges and opportunities on a daily basis in today’s dynamic environment, from harnessing new technologies and techniques to managing risks against a volatile political background.</p>
<p>Not only that – treasurers also increasingly have a role to play in supporting their organisations beyond the traditional remit of treasury. While this means different things in different organisations, many treasurers are having to step outside their comfort zones and become experts in new areas. In some cases, this might mean taking a more proactive role in modelling and analysing potential risk scenarios, or actively shaping business strategy. In others, it might mean taking on the role of change manager and overseeing treasury’s part in a wide-reaching finance transformation project.</p>
<p>It is likely that more treasurers will have to broaden their horizons in the future. PwC’s Global Treasury Benchmark Survey 2017 notes that “CFOs are urging treasurers to be involved in finance processes beyond the traditional scope for treasury such as in working capital management and in actively managing new exposures as these are created by core businesses.” Going forward, the report adds, treasurers should “not only master traditional treasury topics, but also business consultancy, project management, (cyber) security and Fintech developments”. The report also underlines the need for treasury professionals to understand “how to engage and orchestrate people across locations and business functions outside their chain of command”.</p>
<p>Of course, expanding the boundaries of treasury brings certain challenges. For one thing, treasurers need to be more flexible and develop new skills in order to take on new responsibilities and manage a wider range of risks. They may need to become more effective communicators, and work more closely with colleagues across the organisation. At the same time, they still have to find the time to manage their day-to-day responsibilities. In this article, five treasurers describe their experiences of moving beyond the usual parameters of the treasurer’s role.</p>

<h3 id=""becoming-a-strategic-business-partner"">Becoming a strategic business partner</h3>
<p>The ACT’s 2017 survey, The Business of Treasury, found that the vast majority of treasurers around the world see the treasury function as a strategic business partner for their organisations: 54% strongly agree that this is the case, while 35% slightly agree.</p>
<p>The survey also highlighted the extent to which treasurers’ roles have become more strategically focused in recent years. According to the report, treasurers spend 40% of their time on strategic issues, up from 24% in 2013.</p>
<p>The value of the treasurer’s input was also indicated by the survey’s respondents, who noted that treasury recommendations are accepted by the board 84% of the time – a 33% increase in the last five years.</p>

<h3 id=""1-creating-your-own-crisis"">1. ‘Creating your own crisis’</h3>
<p>Guillermo Gualino, Vice President &amp; Treasurer at Agilent Technologies, argues that risk management is an area where treasurers can add particular value by communicating threats more proactively with the rest of the organisation. From the financial crisis to negative interest rates, he says that treasurers are the people who are best placed to anticipate and prepare for the impact of major risk events. He notes that in order to protect the company, it is necessary to impart a sense of urgency when communicating with others within the organisation.</p>
<p>“In a way, you have to create your own crisis before a real crisis happens,” he explains, emphasising that the goal of the exercise is not to create problems or cause alarm, but to bring attention to the potential loss that a risk event could lead to. By doing so, treasurers may be better placed to gain support for preventative actions that the company should be taking.</p>
<p>As such, Gualino says that treasurers need to run through a variety of different scenarios and undertake modelling and analysis. By doing so, treasurers can understand the potential impact of a specific event on the company, from the possible FX impact to business loss. This impact should then be communicated with other groups and with senior management in order to explain both the potential impact and the actions that should be taken in mitigation, from changing pricing to introducing a new hedging programme.</p>
<p>He cites the example of emerging market risk as an area where this approach may be needed: “There’s a cycle that tends to happen in certain markets, where capital inflows bring the prospect of growth, which leads to more excitement and capital inflows,” he observes. “Then a few years later, there may be concern that the economy is overheating, followed by currency devaluation. Everyone understands this risk – but when things are going great, it’s hard to imagine that things will move in the opposite direction soon.”</p>
<p>Gualino notes that his approach to communicating potential risks has proved effective in the past. “We’ve mobilised other groups to prepare for events that have happened further down the line,” he says. “People have come to me afterwards and said, ‘Hey, you predicted this’ – but I explain that I didn’t know for sure that it would happen; I just made sure we were prepared. That’s the role that I see treasury playing – it’s about hoping for the best, but preparing for the worst.”</p>
<h3 id=""2-diversifying-funding"">2. Diversifying funding</h3>
<p>Rick Martin, Group Treasurer at GasLog, an international owner, operator and manager of liquified natural gas (LNG) carriers, argues that treasurers are only really doing their jobs if they are acting as agents of change. “Looking at my patch, LNG shipping finance, the industry is moving away rather quickly from an exclusive focus on long-term charters, with investment-grade counterparties, toward a rapidly growing proportion of spot business, with a much wider range of customers,” he explains.</p>


<blockquote>As I see it, the growing complexity of shipping finance is a great opportunity for treasurers to play a leading role in helping to shape the company’s overall strategy.</blockquote>
<p class=""quote-block__source"">Rick Martin, Group Treasurer, GasLog</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
Martin explains that this naturally underlines the need for a
 more diverse set of financing tools – a trend which is 
further emphasised by the increasing regulatory burden being placed on 
mortgage debt lenders, “the historic bedrock of shipping finance”. <p>Martin
 explains that treasurers must be attuned to these types of changes – 
ideally seeing them coming from a distance – and must work with their 
colleagues to build a capital structure “that will not only permit 
continued financing but, even more so, cultivate it as a source of 
sustainable competitive advantage”.</p> <p>He adds, “as I see it, the 
growing complexity of shipping finance is a great opportunity for 
treasurers to play a leading role in helping to shape the company’s 
overall strategy, even as one takes obvious primary accountability for 
driving the aforementioned evolution in capital strategy.”</p> <h3 id=""3-embracing-non-traditional-treasury"">3. Embracing non-traditional treasury</h3> <p>Jack
 Spitzer is Vice President of Finance and Treasurer at Isagenix, a 
global health and wellness company. “I have a few non-traditional 
treasury areas under my span of control,” he comments. “The largest 
non-traditional treasury area is our Payment Solutions and Merchant 
Services area. Since our products are mostly sold online, it is our 
primary revenue and cash flow source.”</p> <p>According to Spitzer, the 
team oversees all inbound payment methods for the company in all of the 
relevant countries – a task which involves researching, selecting, 
negotiating and implementing popular in-country alternative payment 
methods such as bank transfer, ewallet and cash solutions. “They ensure 
we have the best solutions that open payment flexibility to the broadest
 range of consumers while increasing sales and cash flow,” he explains.</p> <p>In
 addition, Spitzer says that treasury oversees fraud prevention to 
minimise online transactional fraud that may hurt the company or brand. 
“I also oversee various other areas, including our company corporate 
card programme (to maximise rebate),” he says. Likewise he oversees the 
company’s travel programme, the financial operations of the staff 
canteen, and ‘Will Call Store’, a location where customers can pick up 
products they have ordered or buy additional products, “to make sure we 
contain costs on these ancillary areas”. He adds, “There is a greater 
focus on understanding operations and behaviour to generate incremental 
revenue or reduce costs.”</p> <h3 id=""4-setting-up-a-risk-committee"">4. Setting up a risk committee</h3> <p>George
 Dessing, Senior Vice President, Treasury &amp; Risk at global 
information provider Wolters Kluwer, is another who sees the treasurer’s
 role expanding beyond its traditional parameters. As a result of the 
company’s ongoing digital transformation, digital and services revenues 
now account for almost 90% of total revenue, compared to 25% 15 years 
ago. The company’s treasury, risk and real estate team is a group of 
around 30 people based in the US, Ireland and the Netherlands.</p> <p>Like
 Martin, Dessing believes that the treasurer is “almost by definition a 
change manager”. “I see the treasury department as a nexus of 
information, cash and managing risks, which we do from a global 
perspective,” he explains.</p> <p>Dessing explains that in the past, 
treasury was perceived as being purely about liquidity and cash 
management. “Nowadays you see it as much more financially, strategically
 and business focused,” he says. “And that results in the extra 
responsibilities that a lot of treasurers now have, including not just 
corporate finance but also risk management, pensions, real estate, 
working capital and procurement.”</p> <p>As such, Dessing has taken part
 in certain projects which go beyond the traditional remit of treasury. 
This has included setting up a risk committee in order to discuss 
material risk across the organisation, with a focus on topics such as 
cyber security, fraud and incident management. “These may not be the 
traditional risks that you would expect from a treasurer, but more of a 
broader, holistic way of looking at risks,” says Dessing. “That’s where 
the treasurer can play a role.”</p> <p>Dessing says that being a 
treasurer in the current climate involves some additional skills. As 
well as strategic and advisory skills, he notes that one of the things 
treasurers need is the ability to be a people manager and invest in the 
company’s culture, “as well as in the talents around you”. This involves
 staying connected with peers both within the organisation and beyond, 
for example by working on multi-disciplinary projects which go beyond 
the traditional scope of treasury. “I always say to my team that you 
cannot hide behind your PC – you need to get up and walk around and be 
visible,” Dessing adds.</p> <h4 id=""overcoming-the-challenges"">Overcoming the challenges</h4> <p>Expanding
 the parameters of treasury can bring with it certain challenges. 
Dessing says that the complexity and uncertainty faced by treasurers 
requires a certain multi-disciplinary focus. “You cannot only look at 
certain things in isolation from a financial point of view – you have to
 take a broader view. You may also need to be a little bit persistent, 
although you have to listen and be open to new ideas.”</p> <p>Likewise, 
Dessing says that treasurers need to be “streetwise, with a bit of 
courage” and embrace the opportunity to step up when needed. It’s also 
important to question things: “When I get questions from my team, I 
always say that what I’m expecting from them is simply people who can 
say ‘no’, and ‘I don’t understand’,” he notes. “I’m not looking for 
people who only say ‘yes’, but for people who will take a critical look 
at the solutions that are being presented.”</p> <p>However, Dessing also
 notes that the challenges treasurers face can bring some benefits when 
it comes to increasing the treasurer’s profile within the organisation. 
He notes that complexity in the environment, from IFRS 16 (leases) to 
tax reform in the US, gives treasurers the opportunity to shine. “And 
finally, more uncertainty also increases our visibility as a treasurer –
 and it’s great to sit at that board table.”</p> <h3 id=""5-supporting-a-major-finance-transformation-programme"">5. Supporting a major finance transformation programme</h3> <p>As
 Group Treasurer of Equiniti, Daniel Jefferies has first-hand experience
 of acting as an agent of change. When Equiniti embarked upon a 
far-reaching financial transformation programme in 2016, Jefferies had a
 key part to play in overseeing the transformation where treasury was 
concerned.</p> <p>The overall objective of the transformation programme 
was to remove mechanistic, process-driven tasks and offshore them to 
Chennai in order to leverage overseas skills and resources. Meanwhile, 
most of the intellectual capital would be left onshore. “The 
transformation covered everything including AP, expenses and procurement
 as well as treasury,” says Jefferies. “The overall objective was to 
move to a 50:50 split of onshore versus offshore headcount across the 
finance team.”</p> <p>For Jefferies, this provided an opportunity to 
achieve numerous improvements within the area of treasury. “When I first
 joined Equiniti, I was looking to make some operational improvements to
 drive efficiency across the team in terms of what we do and how we do 
it and where we do it,” he says. “So for example, we had processes that 
were really better aligned to other areas within finance, whether that 
be general ledger, bank reconciliations or payment authorisations.”</p> <p>The
 transformation programme brought an opportunity for Jefferies to 
separate out these processes and achieve more efficiency by making use 
of offshore resources. This meant looking at how treasury interacted 
with other areas within finance and exploring best practice, as well as 
considering how certain processes could be put into an offshore 
environment. It also included bringing in solutions to improve existing 
activities.</p> <p>The full transformation took 15-18 months to 
complete, and Jefferies notes that while the treasury part of the 
process was shorter than this, “you are constantly going back and 
reviewing and challenging what you’ve done – do we need to look at 
systems again? Do we need to look at staff again? It’s not something 
that you simply finish and walk away”.</p> <p>Such was the scale of the 
change that Jefferies said it consumed the majority of his day-to-day 
role for the duration of the project. He also notes that a slightly 
different skillset was needed in order to approach the transformation 
successfully. “It had been a while since I was used to operating at that
 level of detail,” he explains. “This included looking at specific 
process flows within finance and how they integrate, as well as 
considering how to maintain the right level of segregation of duties 
while not putting too much additional workload onto the function 
overall.”</p> <p>This brought many benefits where treasury was 
concerned. For one thing, Jefferies was able to use the programme to 
improve experience and skills within the team. “It also gave me an 
opportunity to understand and work a bit more closely with the wider 
finance function across the organisation and to work more closely with 
the group financial controller, so it was a learning experience for me 
as well,” he says. In addition, Jefferies says that knock-on effects 
have included prompting a fresh look at the company’s treasury 
management system.</p> <p>Jefferies observes that while not all 
treasurers will encounter a finance transformation on this scale, most 
treasurers will encounter change management to a greater or lesser 
degree. “The extent to which they’ll encounter change will be dependent 
on the organisation, how mature it is and where it is in its lifecycle,”
 he adds.</p>

<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p><em>If the whole organisation understands the importance of cash, it becomes easier to harvest more diverse, accurate and timely data. From here, better forecasting can drive stronger working capital performance. It’s what most stakeholders expect, so how can it be delivered?</em></p>
<p> Cash is King, maybe; it’s hard to tell as the power that this particular monarch carries has not always been appreciated. However, since the global economy tanked and then started on its long road to recovery, the value of understanding cash basics – such as how much, where and in which currencies – has been rising higher up the agenda.</p>
<p>An accurate picture of current and future cash needs is only possible if every function that affects the ebb and flow of cash understands its importance. Indeed, every touchpoint needs to be able to report its cash position to treasury, with equal accuracy and timeliness, if an enterprise-wide viewpoint is to be achieved.</p>
<p>However, rallying the troops has not always been easy. The list of key protagonists required to achieve this in an industrial context, for example, includes departments as diverse as sales, procurement, finance, production and logistics; each will harbour their own private drivers and agendas.</p>
<p>Regardless of how many functions commune with the King, the importance of building a sustainable cash culture cannot be overstated. It is the driver of accurate forecasting, which is used primarily as a tool to help improve accuracy in investment and borrowing decision-making by identifying in advance potential surplus cash or gaps in cash flow.</p>
<h3 id=""forecasting-matters"">Forecasting matters</h3>
<p>Producing today’s cash position is relatively easy compared to accurate forecasting weeks or months ahead. The further out treasury goes, the harder it becomes to offer anything beyond an educated guess. Nonetheless, the ability to deliver accurate cash predictions can be the difference between running out of money and not running out of money, says Tim Bartlett, Senior Liquidity Commercialisation Manager, HSBC. Indeed, he comments, no matter how much a company is valued on paper, without accurate cash flow forecasting, running out of day-to-day cash is a potentially fatal risk.</p>
<p>There is no one correct method of creating a forecast; it depends upon factors such as the nature of the business or sector, the type of forecast sought, its purpose and format. This may sound somewhat unscientific, but with so many unknowns with which to contend, not least macro-economic ‘events’, forecasting is very difficult to optimise, notes Bartlett.</p>
<p>Of course, there will be some regular and predictable incomings and outgoings which make forecasting a little easier: predictability is the friend of the forecaster. Nonetheless, delivering detailed forecast data with a high degree of accuracy remains a challenge.</p>
<p>Actuals are used to validate forecasts, giving the opportunity to adjust and improve the margins of error in light of any variances identified (and any targets set through KPIs). These validations may be made daily, weekly, monthly or on a longer timescale, according to appetite and ability to monitor, extract, analyse and respond to the data. The more frequently a forecast is updated with real numbers, the more accurate it will be but there comes a point where the effort outstrips the return.</p>
<h3 id=""methods-and-tools"">Methods and tools</h3>
<p>There are many different forecasting methodologies – the distribution method, regression analysis, and time series trends and seasonal variances, for example – most relying on analysis of historic cash flow data. Because there is no guarantee that patterns identified using historical data will reoccur, these techniques will generate a forecast probability which is commonly weighting, in the form of an accepted margin of error. As the actuals are made available, the degree of ‘wrongness’ can be fine-tuned with each set of actuals.</p>
<p>The use of technology can take some of the hard work out of this process. Off-the-shelf solutions, from third-party providers such as Kyriba, CashAnalytics and FiREapps use analytical algorithms written with the benefit of the wider industry experience of each vendor. These can offer complex mathematical responses to common scenarios which will be tuneable to more closely represent a company’s individual circumstances and strategic approach.</p>
<p>Indeed, such systems can improve forecasting accuracy, for example, by incorporating a computer-based understanding of the behaviours of clients in terms of incoming revenues, and the expectations of suppliers in terms of outgoings.</p>
<p>Of course, many businesses use spreadsheet calculations, adding their own margins of error and iterating each set of results to reach the next waypoint. With output from bank reporting tools having become more sophisticated in recent times there is no suggestion that companies cannot produce sufficiently accurate forecasts using their own tools.</p>
<p>However, the nature of forecasting is such that there is always room to increase accuracy, driving stronger working capital performance.</p>
<h3 id=""the-cutting-edge"">The cutting edge</h3>
<p>One area in which advancement is being made is in the adoption of pre-cognitive technology that borders on the realms of artificial intelligence. This is widely used in fraud detection, enabling the recognition of complex patterns of flow and the predictability of certain activities. This, argues, Bartlett, is the kind of solution from which forecasting can and will benefit.</p>
<p>The encouragement of open banking (largely through regulatory measures such as PSD2 in Europe), where institutions share data flows through API-led connectivity could also bring a more easily aggregated view of flows across a multi-banking environment.</p>
<p>Regardless of technological advances applied to any aspect of treasury or finance, Bartlett comments that “these are only ever tools, and tools by definition are something people use to help get the job done”. Of course, the treasurer must know how to use these tools but Bartlett notes a fine line between using them simply as a means of looking for or proving a preconceived notion, and accepting what these tools deliver as the absolute truth.</p>
<h3 id=""higher-expectations"">Higher expectations</h3>
<p>Is there appetite for change? Achieving 100% accuracy every time is an unrealistic goal. However, although some businesses do let cash flow drift to the point of becoming technically insolvent, many do not. This suggests that today’s forecasting measures are, by and large, adequate.</p>
<p>But with many treasuries having become P&amp;L centres in their own right in recent years, Bartlett argues that there may be expectations of increased return overall for the company, itself demanding higher expectations of forecasting precision.</p>

<p class=""quote-block__source"">Todd McElhatton, CFO, SAP North America</p>


<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>We know specialist software can bring about a greater degree of accuracy and this may in turn bring about greater working capital efficiencies. But it is clear that to achieve sustainably positive results, not only is the treasurer’s input vital but also cash has to be given a commanding position by all parts of the business.</p>
<h3 id=""spread-the-word"">Spread the word</h3>
<p>There is an essential “anecdotal” component that must be applied to
sharpen the cold logic of technology. Treasurers must have a real feel
for, and understanding of, their own business, customers and suppliers.
The human element is in part based on the treasurer’s own experience and
professionalism but this can be enhanced when allied to a strong
communicative approach to the role.</p>
<p>This is where the enterprise-wide promotion and support of a
corporate cash culture plays out. Indeed, the ability to reach out to
other functions – such as sales, procurement and production – and to
incorporate their accurate, function-specific data into the forecast in a
timely manner, will deliver the greatest level of forecasting accuracy.
For treasurers and other stakeholders such as the board, the investors
and the analyst community, this is highly beneficial.</p>
<h3 id=""the-practical-power-of-cash"">The practical power of cash</h3>
<p>One company that has spotted the power of putting cash front and
centre of every part of the business, is global tech giant, SAP. “Cash
generation is the clearest measure of success for an enterprise and this
is why we have decided to place such an emphasis on working capital,”
says Todd McElhatton, CFO at SAP North America.</p>
<p>Developing a culture of cash across an organisation as vast as SAP
has been a challenge, with some fundamental changes required at an
operational level. One of the keystones of project success has been the
incentivisation of employees to see cash in this new light, shifting
KPIs to reflect first-class working capital management principles and
practices.</p>
<p>By developing a creative new set of KPIs for SAP’s sales team, for
example, it was able to evolve that function into an effective cash
collection team. In the spirit of the old adage that ‘it’s not sold
until its paid for’, the sales reps now receive their commission payment
for a sale once payment has been received from the customer, explains
McElhatton. “Through linking cash collection and commission in this way,
our sales reps are now engaged with finance to understand who has and
hasn’t paid and chasing up any late payments.”</p>
<p>It was readily acknowledged that such a fundamental change to the
day-to-day working practices of the sales team had potential to create
resentment; without their buy-in, and that of other teams, the project
to drive working capital performance would never work.</p>
<p>For SAP, the natural solution was to leverage technology. “At the
same time that we have focused on working capital management, we have
also focused on building a world-class finance department to support
these efforts,” he explains. Core to this has been the adoption of new
technology that has created efficiencies and provided enhanced
visibility and analytics, allowing the company to better align the goals
of the different departments within the business.</p>
<p>In one practical example, this has seen cash collections benefit from
machine learning and AI technology. The approach, says McElhatton, has
allowed the finance and sales teams to collaborate closely, focusing
only on problematical non-payments. Where finance has a real-time and
historical overview of customer payments performance, it can better
understand the nature of non-payment, working with the sales team who
can reach out to customers only where necessary to begin resolving the
issues.</p>
<p>Through the clever application of technology and the adoption of
considerate change management techniques, SAP has been able to
progressively transform its cash culture across the whole organisation.
It has delivered on its initial working capital improvement objectives
but will remain focused for some time, says McElhatton who adds that
real-time information provides many more opportunities for improving
working capital performance.</p>
<h3 id=""taking-off-with-automation"">Taking off with automation</h3>
<p>Another example of where an analytical approach has yielded results
is with India’s low-fare airline, IndiGo. As the Overall Winner of the
2017 Adam Smith Awards Asia Best Cash Flow Forecasting Solution, the
company demonstrated how automation of its entire cash forecasting
mechanism could offer a huge payback on several levels.</p>
<p>Not least of the benefits has been the realisation that it can
bolster its institutional placement funding with its own optimised cash
reserves to purchase rather than lease most of its planes as a more
cost-effective option.</p>
<p>IndiGo is one of the largest airlines in India with almost 40% market
share. With over 20 banking relationships and more than 40 accounts,
its treasury team was having to tackle numerous cash management
challenges on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Lacking full visibility into many of its accounts, it was troubled by
a liquidity management model that it felt was fraught with manual
administrative exercises. The lack of visibility also meant it was
susceptible to various financial and operational risks.</p>
<p>Shveta Kapur, Associate Director, Treasury, Finance, recalls that its
treasury model “lacked much needed scalability”. It was realised that
existing processes needed “an immediate re-engineering” to manage
treasury operations more effectively. In partnership with its principal
bank, IndiGo carried out an end-to-end review of its liquidity
management processes. This set it on a path towards a number of core
objectives.</p>
<p>To give it accurate cash positioning and risk mitigation, it wanted
real-time and actionable visibility on all its cash positions and flows.
From here, automated rules-based movements could facilitate “easy cash
mobilisation”, providing centralised access and control. As a third
goal, treasury wanted to apply automation to its daily investment
programme. This, it was felt, would enable IndiGo to put a major portion
of its significant (and growing) daily collections immediately to work,
enabling it to earn better interest.</p>
<p>The key to success was a multi-bank cash pooling platform. By
automating its entire cash forecasting mechanism, Kapur says the
solution was able to eliminate all manual intervention in the IndiGo’s
liquidity analysis and interbank fund management.</p>
<p>The project also enabled it to reduce manpower and improve
productivity, affording it annual savings of around 2,000 man-hours. In
creating a single consolidated view, process automation also introduced
enhanced analytics and the kind of cash forecasting accuracy and
liquidity yield that treasurers often strive for.</p>

Tax and treasury: working together,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Once upon a time, most treasurers did not have much direct involvement in tax planning. Tax decisions were typically left to the specialists, while treasurers got on with doing what they do best – managing cash.</p>
<p>Things are starting to change. Whether it’s the unorthodox methods that companies like Apple are using to deal with their trapped cash, or meeting the requirements of regulations such as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), tax issues are assuming an increased importance in the world of corporate treasury. Tax and treasury have always sat side-by-side, structurally, within most organisations. And there are, for that very reason, a number of businesses that have a single head of both functions. One such company is Irish airline Aer Lingus. “Aer Lingus, like a number of other companies, has recognised that there is a close relationship between tax and treasury,” says Tom Milligan, the group’s Director of Insurance, Tax and Treasury. “Whether it is managing assets and liabilities, or compiling forecasts, tax and treasury here are absolutely working together.”</p>
<p>Having responsibility for both tax and treasury sometimes pulls Milligan into strategic debates in areas that might be unfamiliar to the average treasurer. Fleet planning is a case in point. Aer Lingus’s aircraft fleet is comprised of owned, operating-leased, and finance-leased aircraft. When the company plans to expand its fleet, a process which typically begins many years in advance, it does so on the basis of available seats per kilometre (ASK), an equation that is used in commercial aviation to measure passenger carrying capacity. But in order to provide these ASKs, the most tax-efficient route to financing the fleet must first be determined.</p>
<p>It is no surprise then that Milligan and his treasury team are heavily involved in the decision-making process. “How those aircraft come into the fleet will be a combination of those owned, operational-leased and finance-leased methods decided by the fleet planning committee, which I sit on,” explains Milligan. “And I can bring to that committee both the tax and financing implications of the different methods of bringing those aircraft in.”</p>
<h3 id=""working-side-by-side"">Working side-by-side</h3>
<p>The point is that when financing expertise is combined with in-depth knowledge of tax affairs, it can help the business to achieve the most tax-efficient financing structure: something which can be of enormous strategic value. Keeping tax under the same roof as treasury is not an arrangement unique to Aer Lingus, but it is not particularly widespread either. Where it does exist, it is very often the case that one of the disciplines – tax or treasury – remains the main area of expertise, with a team helping with the management of the other area.</p>
<p>“You don’t tend to get tax and treasury managers so much anymore,” says Mike Richards, Managing Director of MR Recruitment. That is at least partly because tax management is seen as an area that requires a high-level of knowledge expertise, he explains. “There are treasurers, who, of course, have a good knowledge of tax. But it is such a specialism – even more so than treasury – that the roles are more often than not kept separate.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the fact that such roles do exist tells us something about the closeness of the two functions. This proximity demonstrates that, even when the two functions are managed separately, it is still a good idea for treasurers to develop a rounded understanding of the tax implications of their decisions – even if most do not require quite the same level of expertise as Milligan does in his role. If the treasury and tax manager are not the same person, then they are at least very likely to be working ever more closely together.</p>
<h3 id=""synthetic-repatriation"">Synthetic repatriation</h3>
<p>Working closely together can have a number of other benefits. The first of these concerns the growth of cash stockpiles on the balance sheets of many multinationals in tandem with the availability of cheap financing on the capital markets. To illustrate the point, it may be useful to look at a funding deal recently secured by a large consumer electronics company. In April 2014, Apple announced one of the largest corporate bond offerings of the year so far. The $12 billion bundle of floating and fixed-rate notes ranging between three and 30 years were issued in order to help the tech giant fund a $90 billion share buyback programme. To observers, however, there was something initially puzzling about the news. Why would the world’s most cash-rich company – with a reported $150 billion cash pile on its balance sheet – need to go to the bond markets for financing? Would it not be cheaper for the company to finance the buyback through its cash reserves instead?</p>
<p>The reason it didn’t, of course, is corporate tax. Nearly all of the cash on Apple’s balance sheet is held by overseas entities and had the company chosen to fund the buyback by bringing home all of its cash from international operations then it would, under US tax law, have been obliged to pay 32% to the Inland Revenue Service (IRS). For Apple, that would have meant a whopping $45 billion tax bill. Considered in that light, it’s not difficult to see why, especially in the current ultra-low rate environment, Apple’s financial executives saw a bond issue as the cheapest way of meeting the company’s domestic cash needs. This strategy is not unique to Apple. A recently published report by Standard &amp; Poor’s analyst Andrew Chang looked at roughly 1,700 US-based multinational companies and found that debt has become a very significant factor in the growth of cash on the balance sheet for a lot of these companies.</p>
<p>For every dollar of cash they accumulated over the past three years, debt increased by almost $4, the study found. At first, the cash flow of most of the companies analysed appears to be more than sufficient to meet their domestic needs – be that capex, buybacks, or dividends. But when Chang looked at it more closely he realised that a substantial amount of the cash on the balance sheet was coming from flows that were being generated overseas. Companies were understandably reluctant to repatriate these flows under the current US tax code. “Essentially there is a mismatch of cash flow and cash uses,” Chang tells Treasury Today. “What we found was that a lot of companies are now issuing debt at very low interest rates in order to ‘synthetically’ access the cash that they have overseas as an alternative to paying a very high rate of tax. This is a trend which we expect to continue over the near term, barring any significant tax reform in the US.”</p>
<h3 id=""changing-regulation"">Changing regulation</h3>
<p>The other main trend that is forcing treasurers to become more mindful of tax issues is regulation. Today, the introduction of regulation means that treasurers simply cannot ignore tax issues. FATCA, which came into effect at the beginning of July 2014, is the most significant of these. The regulation was introduced by the US government to prevent US taxpayers from avoiding tax by investing through non-US financial institutions and offshore investment vehicles. Although FATCA is aimed at financial corporates, in certain circumstances treasury centres and holding companies could find themselves defined as a foreign financial institution (FFI) under the regulation. Some treasury centres will be exempt, but the obligation will be on tax and treasury managers to evaluate whether they or their subsidiary is defined as a FFI under the regulation or not. Whatever the outcome, it means more regulation for the treasurer to understand and digest, as Aer Lingus’s Milligan acknowledges. “Compliance around tax is assuming a much greater focus than it had a couple of years ago and a lot of it is to do with anti-avoidance legislation such as FATCA,” he notes.</p>
<p>There is also the prospect of a co-ordinated tax on financial transactions in Europe. As with FATCA, banks and other financial institutions are meant to be the primary target of the proposed Financial Transactions Tax (FTT). Nobody is in any doubt, however, that end users such as corporates would also suffer, indirectly, if one were to be introduced. In fact, with the levies expected to put a squeeze on liquidity in the bond and derivatives markets, nearly every area of treasury operations – from intercompany funding and risk management to external financing – could be affected to some degree.</p>
<p>Owing to political disagreements, the probability of such a tax being introduced across every EU country now appears unlikely. But experts say that the prospect has still given companies some pause for thought, particularly with respect to how their treasury operations are organised across geographies. “I have heard some anecdotal evidence that some companies might move some of their treasury operations out of the FTT countries into non-FTT countries, simply so that the FTT won’t be an issue when or if it is implemented,” says Capita’s Fleming. “That would be an extreme step, but it will definitely be a consideration for some. And I think a few may well do that depending, perhaps, on the scale of their hedging activities in Europe.”</p>
<p>So recent regulatory demands, just like the issues around trapped cash, are certainly impacting, not only the way tax and treasury departments interact with one another, but also wider strategic decisions taken by the business. But there is also one another way in which such issues are having a profound influence on treasury. That is by encouraging treasurers to build a much deeper knowledge of tax affairs.</p>
<h3 id=""a-new-skill-set"">A new skill-set</h3>
<p>In survey after survey, treasurers say that their role has changed significantly in the past couple of years as they get drawn into areas that were once outside their purview. Tax, as the above examples testify, is certainly one of these areas. If the experts are right, and this trend continues in the years ahead, then treasurers will surely find themselves requiring a much more detailed knowledge of tax issues than they have had until now. “I think that at the level of global treasury it is going to create the need for a whole new skill set,” says Fleming. “Now there are many treasury departments who need to arrange funding on the US capital markets – even though they have significant cash overseas – and that means they will enhance their capital market skills.”</p>
<p>Moreover, with so much cash building up in overseas subsidiaries, treasurers of those companies affected by US tax policy on repatriation may also need to become a little bit more adventurous in their approach to liquidity management. “That is certainly driving them to look beyond bank deposits,” says Fleming. “Since these organisations have become so cash rich, they are having to consider increasingly sophisticated investment techniques to diversify their counterparty risk and are looking more to collateralised deposits, short-dated bonds, and treasury bills that a typical corporate would not normally get involved in.”</p>
<p>This is not the end of the story, however. Tax rules are constantly changing and keeping on top of all the many nuances will, no doubt, require specialist expert advice. Treasurers, then, may find themselves using that hotline to the tax manager more and more in the years ahead – wherever the business operates.</p>

<h3 id=""a-global-issue"">A global issue</h3>
<p>A good understanding of tax becomes particularly essential for the treasurers of businesses that operate in multiple legal jurisdictions, where tax can have an enormous impact on everything from risk management to inter-company funding decisions.</p>
<p>It is commonly understood that tax issues tend to become more salient for companies as they enter emerging markets. However, Treasury Today’s 2013 European Corporate Treasury Benchmarking Study reveals a slightly more nuanced picture. Although one emerging region, Latin America, was seen by the largest number of treasurers (40%) as an area where tax issues pose a great challenge, in other regions dominated by emerging economies, such as Asia, tax issues were actually seen as problematic by a fewer number (26%) than in Europe where 35% cited tax issues as a challenge.</p>

<p>This demonstrates that even if your cross-border activities are limited to advanced markets, such as Europe or the US, tax issues cannot be ignored. “Particularly when you move cross-border, you have to be conscious that nearly everything you do has a tax implication,” says Neil Fleming, Director of Treasury Solutions at Capita Asset Services. “So usually it becomes a partnership relationship between tax and treasury. I don’t think a treasurer would try anything new without getting tax involved to some degree.”</p>

Raising treasury’s profile: how to be a strategic communicator,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Since the global financial crisis, companies have had to focus more on managing their cash flows, working capital, credit lines and risk exposures. The role of corporate treasury has been thrown into the spotlight and treasurers have expanded their remit to become risk managers and strategic influencers.</p>
<p>This is confirmed by a survey carried out by treasury consultancy TreaSolution, which found that more than two-fifths of treasurers believe that their department is of high strategic value to the company and more than half say it is of average strategic value.</p>
<p>PwC’s 2013 Global Working Capital Annual Review also highlights how company directors in Asia, Africa and Australasia have been placing an increased focus on working capital and cash flow management over the past year. Companies can no longer rely on growth to drive cash flow, so they are looking much more carefully at efficient liquidity management. This means that liquidity experts are more essential than ever. In light of this, how can corporate treasurers ensure their voice is heard by the Board?</p>
<h3 id=""risky-business"">Risky business</h3>
<p>“The global financial crisis was a turning point for treasurers,” says Ian Farrar, Partner, Corporate Treasury Solutions at PwC in Hong Kong. “While the role of treasury for some organisations was previously undervalued, their role in raising funding, making efficient use of cash and managing risk has enhanced their position following the crisis as these activities moved up the agenda. Leading treasuries have built off this increased profile ever since, taking on increasingly broad responsibilities to manage all kinds of risk, from ‘bread and butter’ FX, interest rate risk and commodities, to commercial credit risk on receivables, insurance and involvement in M&amp;A.”</p>
<p>Not all corporate treasuries have taken on more risk management and many companies have become increasingly risk-averse in response to financial uncertainty. Some practitioners report they have a far more restricted remit when it comes to the kind of hedging instruments company policy allows them to use. Lelaina Lim, CFO at the sport and fashion brand retailer RSH Ltd, based in Singapore, says: “Risk management has become dominant but also more conservative. In the past we could hedge with forwards – now we’re not allowed to do forward deals that could hurt the bottom line and it’s more plain vanilla. This more risk-averse policy was a decision that came from the group treasurer and senior management after 2009.”</p>
<p>Despite the conservative hedging policy, Lim is able to add value to RSH’s bottom line through combining her knowledge of the business – with the seasonal aspect of its retail cash flows – with her financial expertise. An example where both business and financial insight are needed is in the management of bank covenants. She says: “Treasury needs to ensure its knowledge of the business is so good there will be no breach of covenants – because in a breach, the bank can pull credit lines. But first the treasurer must understand both its business and the relative covenants – which include the needs of the business, such as seasonal differences. It then needs to work with the banks to ensure that these covenants have enough head room. This would reduce a lot of uncertainty and headache for the Board in case of a breach.”</p>
<p>Another consideration in Asia is that company structure can determine a company’s appetite for risk. PwC’s Farrar has identified two tiers of corporates in Hong Kong and China: the family-controlled businesses and large MNCs. Of the family-led companies, he says: “These tend to be quite conservative, so treasury’s hands may be tied in their activities. For example, such companies often shy away from the use of derivatives to manage risk.” In contrast, the treasury function tends to have a higher profile in multinationals. Farrar adds: “Their corporate treasurers are getting increasingly proactive. They are getting out into the business more and asking the Board and CFO for time on the agenda.”</p>
<h3 id=""loosening-the-reins"">Loosening the reins</h3>
<p>Should Boards consider giving the treasury function more control over choice of hedging instruments? RSH’s Lim thinks so. She says: “If the group didn’t have such stringent restrictions, there would be more leeway for us to have investment and hedging strategies – and this could help the bottom line in a positive market. So our hands are tied but the risk is lower.”</p>
<p>She adds: “I think that if the Board listened to treasury and saw that treasury can do more, then it would be possible for us to follow a more aggressive higher-risk strategy – but the ongoing dialogue needs to be more open between us and the Board.”</p>
<h3 id=""be-relevant-be-brief"">Be relevant, be brief</h3>
<p>One thing is required by all treasurers who want to demonstrate their value to senior management: good communication. When it comes to Boardroom meetings there are several skills every treasurer should have at his or her disposal.</p>
<p>For a start, according to PwC’s Farrar, how often the corporate treasurer participates in Board meetings is a sign of a healthy relationship and status for treasury within the organisation. He says: “When it comes to how treasury communicates with the Board, there are a variety of practices. Some companies have monthly meetings, while the best-in-class might have weekly meetings with a treasury steering committee. But for the majority, formal meetings more than once a month are quite rare.”</p>
<p>Dan Carmody, Managing Director at TreaSolution, agrees that regular meetings between the Board, senior management and the corporate treasurer open the door for good communication and raising treasury’s ability to influence. There are, however, cases in which treasury needs to be more involved. He says: “One reason for additional meetings and conversations is when a company has stringent liquidity management requirements – eg if it is trying to pay off some debt, or if a strategic move, such as an acquisition, is going to be made. In these cases, generally, treasury’s strategic involvement grows and treasury’s position becomes more integral.”</p>
<p>It’s not just the frequency of the meetings that you need to worry about. Getting the key messages across is also essential and this often has to be done in a very limited slot on the agenda.</p>
<p>Carmody says: “A lot of treasury information is quantified and can be transmitted by spreadsheets and graphics via email. A more detailed explanation of this data requires public speaking skills so a treasurer can communicate well with the Board, CEO or CFO. Furthermore, when giving presentations it is important to be very clear and concise. Public speaking skills can be developed if this isn’t a strong point.”</p>
<p>Anecdotally, Board members are showing more interest in treasury than they used to. One non-executive recently asked PwC’s Farrar for advice on what he should be asking his corporate treasurer. This suggests that Boards need to be educated about treasury and this is a role that should fall to the corporate treasurer.</p>
<h3 id=""treasury-is-what-you-make-it"">Treasury is what you make it</h3>
<p>Since Lehman Brothers first filed for Chapter 11 in September 2008, corporate treasury worldwide has been on a bit of a white-knuckle roller coaster ride. But amid the late nights and tight spots, there has been a lot of opportunity for financial practitioners to really prove their worth. Gary Slawther is the Corporate Treasurer at Octal, a manufacturer of the polymer resin PET (polyethylene terephthalate), which is used to make plastic bottles and packaging products, headquartered in Oman. He says: “My career has blossomed in companies during difficult times – with a higher profile you can achieve greater things.”</p>
<p>“Sometimes the role of corporate treasurer is what you make of it, so you have to make yourself valuable. I enjoy being at the heart of commercial issues – in business, everything involves cash and risk. If treasury doesn’t know everything that’s happening in the business, it can’t manage the risk – you have to know about the problems and how to support the business,” he adds.</p>
<p>On the subject of precisely how to achieve a higher profile and make the role of corporate treasurer as valuable as it can be, Slawther emphasises communication and the ability to win over the Board. He says: “Board meetings are a big learning curve – you quickly learn what keeps their attention (which is usually short). When the company runs out of cash, then you have their full attention – and you have to tell them how you’re going to use your skills to ease cash flow in a three-minute pitch – so brevity and the ability to focus on what is important are essential.”</p>
<h3 id=""the-perfect-partner"">The perfect partner</h3>
<p>Communication isn’t just an upward flow – it’s also important for treasurers to really understand their business. Slawther says he has become familiar with the plastics production process and can engage with people on the operational and production side of Octal. Having a working knowledge of all parts of the business can prove to be very valuable indeed to the treasurer. “Keep your eyes and ears open – most companies are poor on communications, so build internal networks around the business that allow you to communicate. A lot of operational people will view you as the person who makes sure their wages get to the bank – engage in the business and never assume you know it all – learn and know the business,” says Slawther.</p>
<p>According to TreaSolution’s Carmody, treasury should strive to be the cash and financial risk management experts within an organisation. He says: “By creating an ‘internal gravity’ pertaining to treasury department functions this may encourage business units to ask treasury for cash and financial risk management support and expertise.”</p>
<p>That’s not to say that treasurers should be consulted on every company matter – this article doesn’t make the case for treasury world-domination. But when it comes to strategic decisions that involve investment, financial risk and cash – and many do – then a wise Board will get treasury involved at an early stage.</p>
<h3 id=""treasury-from-the-cfos-perspective"">Treasury from the CFO’s perspective</h3>
<p>So what is the view from the other side? Honnus Cheung is the CFO for Asia Pacific, Travelzoo (Asia Pacific) Inc., based in Hong Kong. Treasury reports into her while other financial functions – tax, audit, risk management – also come under her remit. Travelzoo is an internet media company and publisher of travel and entertainment deals, operating globally.</p>
<p>The CFO sees the treasurer as a vital partner who provides valuable support to the business units, as well as providing international liquidity management expertise. For example, treasury can advise sales on how to negotiate better terms for sales contracts, to improve day’s sales outstanding (DSO) or day’s payables outstanding (DPO). Cheung says: “Sometimes getting a contract doesn’t mean getting the cash flow. Data on cash availability is essential to the CFO and the Board, but the data needs to be timely and transparent. Treasury can work closely with the business units and in particular with sales and the procurement team; they can assist the business units to structure a better DPO/DSO to increase the flexibility of working capital, and ensure that all financial positions are managed as efficiently as possible.”</p>
<p>As CFO, Cheung also believes that the treasurer should have an international outlook and a broad level of understanding outside treasury, with awareness of the political as well as the financial environment. She says: “They need to have the minimum capital structure requirement knowledge of different jurisdictions, eg repatriation rules, minimum debt and equity ratio regulation. Being a competent regional treasurer, they can advise on how to leverage the regional cash pool to benefit different countries, how to get a better and low risk yield from idle cash and funding requirements via issuance of debt, shares or IPO for long-term investment.” She adds that sensitivity to currency fluctuations in Asia, as well as against the US dollar and euro, is also a key part of the treasurer’s role.</p>
<h3 id=""all-about-the-bottom-line"">All about the bottom line</h3>
<p>Industry sector also affects how treasury can influence company strategy. While a consumer goods retailer might have constant cash inflows and certain short-term market risk exposures, a property development company needs to take a longer view, with long-term investments and a more complex debt structure.</p>
<p>Sharon Sng is Head of Corporate Finance at CapitaLand, one of Asia’s biggest real-estate companies, headquartered and listed in Singapore. Its property portfolio includes shopping malls, offices and homes and the role of corporate finance is wide-ranging. While Sng is involved in the company’s investment decisions, she also plays an important coordinating role in ensuring each of the company’s entities presents a consistent brand to investors.</p>
<p>She says: “A key contribution of our function is being involved in the investment decisions process early on. Being in a capital intensive sector where investments have longer gestation periods, the financing decision has a significant impact on the returns and consequently investment structures and final decision. CapitaLand has eight listed entities within the group, including the parent company, hence it is particularly important that fundraising activity across the group is well coordinated, to avoid confusing investors and the market, as well as to ensure the success of each fundraising.”</p>
<h3 id=""the-fundamental-things"">The fundamental things</h3>
<p>So whether your corporate treasury is already a part of the company’s strategic decisions or perhaps you’d like to increase your standing with the CFO, the Board or with other business units, it’s worth remembering that the basic treasury skills continue to be the most valued. Octal’s Slawther says that in times of growth or crisis, treasurers shouldn’t forget that their core areas of expertise will always be essential to senior management: “The fundamental things – risk, return and cash – never change. In times of exuberance and downturns, these fundamentals still apply. However, the value the executive Board places on treasury has changed as we have been through a challenging period. In times of cash constraint, treasurers can reveal their true worth. So you don’t just need people with tech skills, but someone who is able to sit down monthly with the Board and translate the issues into a language people can understand.”</p>

Treasury for the social media age,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Financial professionals have been slow to foray into the social media realm – a hesitancy which some have speculated stems from concerns regarding reputational and security risk. There are some indications that this may be changing, however. In a 2011 study by American Century Investments (<a href=""#chart-1-how-would-you-characterise-your-level-of-experience-with-social-media"">see chart below</a>) half of the financial professionals who participated in the study said that they were either moderate or extensive users of social media. A further 35% claimed to be “lurking in the shadows, trying to understand the value”.</p>
<p>While many investment professionals are still ‘lurking’, most are participating regularly in social media. Half of the financial services professionals participating in the study indicated they have moderate or extensive experience with social media.</p>
<p>“I think that slowly there is going to be a shift,” says Nasreen Quibria, an Executive Consultant and Payments Expert for CGI. “There is going to be more uptake as treasurers and financial professionals more broadly, become more comfortable with social media as they realise the value-add of these tools.”</p>
<p>Judging by the growing levels of activity in discussion groups on the LinkedIn website, it appears to be largely the networking function of social media that is currently attracting most interest from the financial community. LinkedIn is used principally as a tool for self-promotion and connecting with industry peers. These benefits, Quibria believes, have become increasingly important in recent years. “Treasurers and other financial practitioners are using social media more for personal or career reasons,” she says. “In the current uncertain economic environment it has become particularly important, as it is a way for you to establish a positive image and promote yourself online.”</p>
<p>But for those treasurers who do put aside their reservations and embrace social communications, there are, she says, a number of potential pitfalls of which they should be aware.</p>
<p>One common mistake that Quibria highlights is typically made before the professional even begins to interact with peers. Sometimes, financial practitioners new to social media will not pay enough attention to building a professional looking profile – the first impression given to a potential interviewer. An unprofessional or clumsily taken photograph is one example of a hazard that should be avoided, Quibria stresses.</p>

<h3 id=""building-treasury-2-0"">Building Treasury 2.0</h3>
<p>Social communications are beginning to find some level of acceptance within the financial community – at least from a personal, networking perspective. But whether a site such as LinkedIn has any practical benefits for the corporate treasurer beyond keeping in touch with industry peers and finding out about the latest job opportunities is doubtful, most experts agree. According to Daniel Andres, Business Development at Entarena, the benefits of traditional social media platforms are rather limited. “For the finance professional, Twitter is useful mainly for collecting information, to find out what is going on within the treasury community and keeping up-to-date with new developments,” he says. “LinkedIn can be interesting from a networking perspective, for promoting yourself and perhaps finding suitable candidates for open positions in your finance department as well.”</p>
<p>But that is where it stops for the traditional social media platforms. Their usefulness from a treasury perspective, he suggests, “is fairly limited, since it never really enters the daily business processes of the treasurer, accountant or cash manager.”</p>
<p>But what if the traditional social media platforms could be adapted to better suit the treasurer’s requirements?</p>
<p>In the past few years, several platforms have been launched aiming to do just this. One of these is Entarena, a communication platform launched in 2011, which builds upon the two most useful aspects of social media: the collection and communication of information, and integrates this with existing business applications. The system, which was recently adopted by the German airline Lufthansa, allows the corporate treasurer to create customised dashboards around each bank relationship. The dashboards have the capacity to combine internal data from ERP, trading, treasury and banking systems with external data such as market news. Notifications can then be delivered relating to key news or events and the treasurer can additionally use the dashboard to communicate any relevant data either internally or externally.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There is going to be more uptake as treasurers, and financial professionals more broadly, become more comfortable with social media as they realise the value add of these tools.”</p>
<p><cite>Nasreen Quibria, Executive Consultant and Payments Expert for CGI</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Treasurers still see social media as a marketing tool or a sales-driven initiative within the company,” says Andres. “But having a platform and a solution that brings communication in-house and around your daily job, so that it becomes an integral part of the workflow of a treasurer, is when we can see huge benefits.”</p>
<p>However, he acknowledges that the industry is still only at the beginning when it comes to applying social technology into business workflows, adding that “there are currently not many solutions out in the market which have been built with the focus on directly building social communication into the work processes.”</p>
<p>But Andres isn’t the only person to recognise the potential of social communications for use as a business tool. Last year, Daniel Marovitz, former Global Head of Products at Deutsche Bank’s Global Transaction Banking division, founded buzzumi, a cloud-based platform that powers professional conversations online. Unlike other products in the online meeting or conferencing space, it enables a company’s employees to have meetings and sales conversations online in a fully branded environment, while giving managers full auditability and control.</p>
<p>Marovitz himself is no stranger to the world of social media having previously spearheaded Drive DB, a successful web-based community site which allowed Deutsche Bank clients to participate in product design and development through online voting, debates and information sharing. With his new project, buzzumi, Marovitz is once again demonstrating that social media can indeed work in a financial professional setting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Security concerns are diminishing. IT departments always look into the security aspect and in most cases they come to the conclusion that the technology is as secure, if not more secure, than internal systems.”</p>
<p><cite>Daniel Andres, Business Development at Entarena</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Our new platform buzzumi is all about empowering professional conversations,” he says. “The issue is that, particularly in well-regulated industries such as finance, there is a lot of difficulty using tools that are intended for the consumer world – they are just not fit for purpose. Online sales meetings need content control and recording that can satisfy the demands of the compliance department.”</p>
<p>buzzumi offers several functions which Marovitz says businesses will not find anywhere else. Firstly, the platform is a fully brandable environment. So unlike the market-leading VOIP platform, Skype, only the client’s brand is visible. And the interface can be customised to reflect the look and feel of the client’s existing web presence. The second unique feature, he explains, is that a company can perform a range of different interactions, removing the need for multiple platforms. In the near future, the platform will also offer integration with leading client relationship management (CRM) platforms, such as <a href=""http://salesforce.com"" target=""_blank"">Salesforce.com</a>.</p>
<p>The platform also provides dashboards complete with integrated analytics. So if a company was to empower its sales force, for example, with the buzzumi tool set, when they talk to clients over the platform the company can monitor all the details of the meeting – what was talked about, what presentation was shared, how long the meeting lasted, etc. Of course, there is inevitably a degree of intimacy which is lost when face-to-face meetings are exchanged for web-based video conferences, he acknowledges, but what a company gains is more control. “This platform allows you to govern all those interactions. For example, we have built-in content libraries that are controlled, so you can be sure that only presentations that have been approved by legal and marketing are being shared with clients.</p>
<p>This means a company can create a sales force that is much more efficient – firstly, because they are not running around the world, burning time and travel cost; and secondly because the tool set gives the company more control around what each person is doing.”</p>
<p>Quibria agrees with Andres and Marovitz that the potential for improved and more efficient communication is where treasurers and the financial profession as a whole will find the real benefits of social media. “I think where they can really leverage the tools of social media is with project-based engagement – where managing projects via email attachments is not necessarily efficient,” she says. There are various applications now on the market which can provide more transparent work schemes, which can enable treasurers to share resources, track items, and using the cloud source innovation to effectively collaborate remotely with other colleagues in different locations.</p>
<p>“One of the tools that we use at my company is a platform called Yammer,” she says. With approximately 72,000 employees at CGI globally, Yammer, a private social network for enterprises, is an extremely useful engagement system to have, she says. “It is a fantastic tool for identifying and communicating with individuals within the organisation,” she says. “Whether the individual is in Europe or Asia, finding the right person and then learning from and leveraging their expertise is a lot faster and more efficient than using traditional communication methods.”</p>
<h3 id=""but-is-it-safe"">But is it safe?</h3>
<p>The emergence of enterprise-specific social communications technology, such as Entarena, Buzzumi and Yammer, shows that traditional social media technology is being adapted in some innovative ways for the corporate finance community. And as a result, there seems to be a growing consensus that social media can indeed provide tangible benefits for the treasurer and other professionals. But what might hinder greater acceptance of social media technology in the world of corporate treasury?</p>
<p>Security is one area of concern that continues to be a stumbling block to companies and business professionals in relation to social media. But Andres refutes the suggestion that this unease will persist in the long term. “Obviously all finance departments have concerns around the security of their financial data,” he says, “but look at market trends – you now have treasury and payment systems that are software-as-a-service (SaaS). Clearly these security concerns are diminishing. IT departments always look into the security aspect and in most cases they come to the conclusion that the technology is as secure, if not more secure, than internal systems.”</p>
<p>Marovitz believes security may still be a concern within risk-adverse financial professions. However, these concerns merely strengthen his argument for enterprise-specific social communications over the traditional, less secure social media platforms, he says.</p>
<p>“I think that security remains a fundamental concern, which is why we built our product with security sensitivity in mind,” Marovitz says. “Every single thing we do is encrypted, so you can’t even come to buzzumi’s marketing website without encountering encryption. Everything runs under SSL (secure sockets layer). We did all that at the beginning as a matter of course to ensure that we are positioned so that CIOs don’t have any concerns over our platform,” he says, adding that he wants buzzumi to be viewed as “rock solid”.</p>

Tongue-tied: overcoming the language barrier ,"




<h2 class=""h2 copy__heading""></h2>
<h3 class=""sub-heading copy__sub-heading""></h3>
<p>Against a backdrop of low interest rates and stagnant economic growth, multinational corporations (MNCs) in Europe and the US have increasingly looked to expand their businesses in the more active emerging markets. Offering attractive growth opportunities, Asia remains a target for many companies, yet expansion prospects are not limited to companies in the West – Asian companies are also ambitious when it comes to expanding within the region.</p>
<p>The 2012 Fortune Global 500 list included 68 companies from Japan, 61 from China (up from 16 in 2005), 14 from South Korea, eight each from India and Taiwan, two from Singapore and one respectively from Malaysia and Thailand. Furthermore, research published by FTI Consulting in January 2012 indicated that 45% of companies in Asia were planning strategic acquisitions in Europe in the coming year.</p>
<p>While expansion both into and across the region appears attractive, companies operating in Asia must contend with a number of different challenges, not least that of language. According to 2012 research by the Economist Intelligence Unit, almost 50% of executives at MNCs report that language difficulties have dissolved cross-border business deals and caused significant financial losses for their respective companies. Chinese companies were affected even more so, with 61% respectively reporting financial losses as a result of failed cross-border transactions.</p>
<p>According to Anna Shevchenko, Managing Director at 3CN, language is the most dynamic reflection of culture. “But breaking down language barriers brings with it certain cognitive risks, as it does not always mean breaking down the barriers of perception.”</p>
<h3 id=""whats-in-a-word"">What’s in a word?</h3>
<p>The spoken language also comprises a whole range of cultural and sociological symbols, argues Alain Bridoux, Consultant at Transnations, a cross-cultural consultancy, and formerly CFO of a Sandvik China joint venture. “Language barriers do not only include the understanding of words, but more generally the meaning of words and their true intentions as expressed by the person or organisation. This is important when it comes to indirect cultures where people do not easily express how they feel.”</p>
<p>This lack of forwardness can be illustrated by the strong sense of ‘saving face’ in Asian cultures, according to Bridoux. The Chinese word for face is mianzi and losing mianzi can be disastrous. Most companies conducting business in the region take care to avoid such a scenario, but it is quite possible to do something unintentional that causes offence: a Westerner, for example, is likely to ask someone for help or further explanation; this, however, would be viewed as a significant gaffe in China and could actually cause a breakdown in working relations.</p>
<p>Mingmei Chang, Vice President of Corporate Liquidity in China at SunGard, who is based in Shanghai, reports that many Chinese MNCs that SunGard work with, such as global giant Huawei, often outsource linguistic and cultural communication issues to independent consulting groups. Other companies are hiring interpreters to bridge the gap, despite the expense involved and the fact that they may not be entirely familiar with the complex subject matter.</p>
<p>Having someone with minimal experience as regards the material and discussions at high level meetings they are expected to decode may be a large risk for a corporate executive to take, but Bridoux was more than satisfied with the translator he worked with for nine months in his previous role at Sandvik.</p>
<p>“In many cases, she knew not just what words to use but how to talk to people in the best manner possible. I gave her some assignments to convey a certain message, speaking to her in a Western manner, which she was then able to pass on in a more subtle Chinese way,” he explains. Naturally, the amount of trust involved in this kind of relationship is enormous and something that not every manager would be comfortable with.</p>
<p>According to Sanmit Ahuja, CEO at ETI Dynamics, it is important to understand how sociological and economic factors play a significant role in this ‘disconnect’. “Up until the turn of the last century, North America and Europe were the two central pillars of the world and that domination is now being challenged by new rising giants. In corporate environments, many Western managers still have a ‘know it all’ attitude to whatever goes on in Asia or Africa and that does not go down very well in these regions,” he says.</p>
<p>Cross-border deals and mergers that have failed to be realised through misunderstandings and cultural slights – perhaps assisted by this historical arrogance – are playing havoc with the bottom line. Even if successful, differences post-merger can also hinder effective communication in various ways, whether at an executive level or for the average employee. For example, workers who are not fluent in the primary language used in the workplace may have difficulty expressing their needs or responding to requests from colleagues.</p>
<p>Despite the need for a deeper understanding of cultural and linguistic differences, many companies have been slow to come up with an appropriate solution. Some Asian corporates do not wish to acknowledge an issue at all and prohibit any sort of linguistic education for fear their staff will become “disobedient”, says Bridoux. “The success rate from all acquisitions in Asia is approximately 20% or lower. Language and cultural barriers have a large part to play in this breakdown, as it is uncommon in state-owned companies that employees would be allowed to learn English.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A strong local workforce in Asia that could work closely with Western colleagues to execute corporate strategy is key to success.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the cost of failing to address this issue has not been adequately studied. So when a serious blunder is made, it’s treated as one-off human error rather than systemic, according to Dr. Kevin Lin, Managing Director, KL Communications. Yet, taking a small selection of recent cultural blunders, it is plain to see that the problem is much more widespread. Says Lin: “In 2005, Nike lost tens of millions when its advert containing cultural gaffes was banned in China. Google paid a reportedly seven-figure sum to buy its Chinese domain name. And Pfizer is selling Viagra in China under a far less eye-catching name than the one it was initially known for after failing to understand the difference between Viagra in English and what it might be in Chinese.”</p>
<p>It is clear that most corporates are actively looking for solutions for this communication divide because it can be a significant source of inefficiency between colleagues from different cultures failing to understand or misunderstanding each other’s intentions or views expressed either verbally or via email. However, there is much more to do, according to Lin. “The language and culture topic is rather like keeping fit. Everyone agrees it’s very important. However, far less would actually join a gym and even fewer regularly get on the treadmill,” he says.</p>
<h3 id=""corporate-culture"">Corporate culture</h3>
<p>Janet Ming, Head of China Desk EMEA at RBS, has been working in London for the past year running RBS’ China desk. Using both Mandarin and English in daily working life, liaising between Chinese companies moving West and Western companies expanding into China, she has a unique view of the situation. She sees a principal difference in corporate culture between Asian companies, which are more relationship driven, and Western companies, which are more business driven. “In the West, there is more of a work/life separation, meaning executives don’t necessarily need to entertain clients in order to do business with them. Asian business, however, relies much more on personal time to build up relationships with clients.”</p>
<p>Ahuja agrees with Ming’s assessment. “For example, in India, it’s not unusual to celebrate a festival within the office or to invite the whole office to a family wedding party,” he says. “Moreover, in many parts of Asia, transactions and deals are done on a handshake, based on the trust between business associates, not the endless documents and bureaucratic process that Westerners prefer.”</p>
<p>Ming also says that Western companies are used to a free market environment and a clearly defined regulatory framework, so they find it difficult to understand when their Chinese colleagues or employees explain that certain things can’t be done or can’t be done consistently in all the locations they operate. On the other hand, Asian companies don’t fully comprehend the possibilities open to them.</p>
<p>An additional cultural challenge is the fact that in much of Asia – and particularly China, in Chang’s case – it can take years to develop business relationships. “In one case we spent five years building up a relationship with an energy company before any deal was signed,” she says. This is an aspect of operating in Asia which many Western companies often overlook and set their expectations on a more rapid return on their expansion projects than regional business codes can allow for.</p>
<p>Chang believes, however, that attitudes are changing as both sides become more adept at working together. Chinese companies are becoming more open and Western companies are adapting their expectations to the business culture. In a situation that requires both sides to make efforts, “you have to dance together,” she says.</p>
<p>Deep-rooted and pervasive cultural and socio-economic issues can also account for differences in management styles. In his book Outliers: The Story of Success, Malcolm Gladwell wrote: “Cultural legacies are powerful forces. They have deep roots and long lives. They persist, generation after generation, virtually intact, even as the economic and social and demographic conditions that spawned them have vanished.”</p>
<p>For example, the motto of the joint venture where Bridoux worked (in which the Chinese partner was an old state-owned company) meant that if you take enough little hands you can grind any complex problem. Explains Bridoux: “When the managers of the joint venture came across a complicated issue, their solution was to bring another ten or 20 people on board. This may be effective in simple construction work/situations but not at all feasible for complex industrial work. The difference in management style between ‘lean management’ and this type of bulk labour cannot be reconciled.”</p>
<p>Old habits die hard, especially when managers feel that their authority is in question. For example, according to a study carried out by the University of Melbourne in 2009, the introduction of English as a corporate language in a German MNC resulted in conflict between Japanese managers within the firm, as junior executives invariably had better English language skills than their seniors. Termed ‘power authority distortion’, the junior managers had better access to decision-making and more power than their bosses. Naturally this explains the reticence of management in some industries in adopting a uniform foreign corporate language.</p>

<p>Undeniably, a multicultural workforce can offer benefits such as a broader range of perspectives and a greater ability to compete in the global marketplace. But introducing new languages and cultures into a work environment can also create barriers that must be overcome. Settling on a common corporate language can help but, as mentioned above, some may resist this – if not openly, then ‘under the radar’ – and may even encourage subordinates and colleagues to do the same. This can then translate to discrepancies between company policy and employee practices.</p>
<p>Ming believes that the situation is improving. “The Chinese government has been proactively pushing English education, for example, but there are also young people in the West learning Mandarin and some of them even speak local dialects.” As language capabilities open up, so will a more tolerant approach to the varying cultural practices.</p>
<p>To move things further, much more is still needed. Western companies experiencing success in the more cosmopolitan and westernised eastern side of China, particularly in Beijing and Shanghai, will face far greater challenges as they seek to move into China’s interior provinces.</p>
<p>In order to successfully navigate Asia Pacific, Ming believes that a strong local workforce in Asia that could work closely with Western colleagues to execute corporate strategy set by the HQ in a more localised approach is key to success. Western companies need to begin to delegate to their local management and trust them to execute plans from top management. This shift is already noticeable as regional treasury centres are increasingly established in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore to ensure decision making concerning the region is more effective.</p>
<h3 id=""expansion-plans"">Expansion plans</h3>
<p>For any corporate expanding its operations globally, management needs to assess and acknowledge the scale of the task in hand. Says Ahuja: “How are you going to do business there? Are you still going to fly in for the relevant meetings? Or are you going to set up your own presence and employ trusted people that have been established there for a long period of time – those who understand the culture and have their own local connections, as opposed to depending on a third party or joint venture partner?”</p>
<p>The extent of the communication barrier to overcome will, at least in part, be related to the role of the employee within the company. Engineers will have numbers, graphs and common standards as communication aids, whereas managers in business and strategy meetings with people of multiple cultures and languages will be at more of a loss.</p>
<p>Developments in multimedia technologies can also assist. As technologies for video, digital animation and media editing become ever more sophisticated and widespread, the world is developing a new vernacular for communication. Skype, for example, helps when it comes to barriers of language, says Shevchenko. “We oversaw a consultancy project for one MNC where we asked the managers to use video cameras for their morning communication sessions – so they could see the facial expressions and identify if the message was understood. This dramatically improved the communication between offices.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the landscape is changing. According to Microsoft’s central market organisation lead for Asia Pacific, Frederique Covington Corbett, the industry has to start treating cultural knowledge as a professional competency, with the software company considering it a key proficiency skill for its staff. Large companies are now beginning to realise that they cannot make any real progress without taking linguistic and cultural barriers into account – and addressing them head on.</p>
